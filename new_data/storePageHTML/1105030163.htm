        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I never write reviews. This is my first ever. But when an app comes along that changes the way I practice, helps the way I teach, and provides a new way of hearing music, I couldn’t help but do a review. The exercises are so well thought out, and have so much to offer both the complete beginner and the most world class musicians alike. Being an instructor at Nashville Music Academy, I can say this app has developed my ear and my students ear to a level that would have taken many more years to develop, if at all, without it. Do yourself a favor, take the step, make the commitment to complete all the exercises, and watch yourself grow as a musician like you never thought possible. Albeit this is a tool, and what you do with it is up to you, but through this training you can truly take the phrase “if you can hear it, you can play it” to heart. Thank you to the entire EarMaster team.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>It’s an extremely useful app, I can see an obvious improvement after about three weeks of using it. I’m currently using the exercises (after purchasing the bundle). It’s really worth the money imho. One thing I’ve noticed though that I didn’t like so far is in the Chord inversions exercise when I make a mistake whether it was an augmented chord and not a diminished one, it logically should show the difference between the different chord types for the SAME key in my opinion and not based on the first note you hear. Or is there some kind of a setting where this can be changed?<br />Otherwise, so far, I’m a very happy user. I use it daily for 45-60 minutes doing two rounds of each exercise type in my current exercise set.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>EarMaster is not just for the youth and teens, but I love it and I am an older adult just now getting into music.  I have a lot of catching up to do and EarMaster has tons of lessons designed to give users a thorough background from the basics on up.  And all this for a nominal cost.  Additionally, on occasion I have some technical, music-related questions and each time I have asked about something, I got a prompt and thorough response.  I have much respect for this app and the people who put it together as well as  what it can do to help others to become more musically talented.  Hope this is helpful.  Take care...</p>

New feature: the \"Note names\" interface is now also available in Melody Singback.\n- New feature: in \"Customized Exercise\" mode, changing the tempo in \"Exercise Options\" now updates the tempo setting in the exercise configuration.\n- Bug fix: in interval, scale and chord exercises, you can now give your answers in any octave again.\n- Bug fix on iOS 15: when leaving the app and then coming back, you would see a message about the exercise being paused.\n","releaseDate":"2021-10-06"},{"versionDisplay":"1.1.11","releaseNotes":"NEW FEATURES\n* Exercise setup in melodic exercises: you can now hear your selection for range options or the \"Play tonic of key\" options.\n* New custom pitch/vocal range in both Preferences and Exercise Setup.\n* Singing exercises: the app is now better at ignoring metronome sounds that are picked up by the mic.\n* Sight-Singing: you can now turn off the metronome if other voices are played, so that you can follow those instead of the metronome.\n* Singback and Clapback: when listening to your answer, the options \"Play lead-in\" and \"Play metronome during question\" are respected. \n* Rhythmic Dictation now also has the exercise option \"Auto repeat question\"\n* New option in Preferences \u003e Other options: \"Use native HTTPS requests\". This can be used to solve connection problems.\n\n\nLANGUAGES\n* New language: Hungarian translation (App and Beginner’s Course only)\n* Russian: Fixed wrong tone name \"C\"\n* English: In the Jazz Workshop “Chord Identification, the chord \"mi(maj7,b5)\" has been renamed \"Dim,maj7\". Also, all custom chords now begin with an uppercase.\n* French General Workshops: Revised the Interval Singing workshop to exclude movable-do solfege and use interval names instead.\n* French: minor revision of the App text\n* Russian and Polish: some lesson descriptions weren’t displayed correctly. This should now be fixed.\n* German, Italian and Chinese: Fixed a few typos and spelling errors in the Beginner’s Course.\n\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n* We fixed a problem with \"Auto Submit Answer\" in Melodic Dictation: if enabled while using a pitch-only exercise, it would still be enabled when switching to an exercise with rhythmic note values. However, the setting was removed from Exercise Options, so you could not disable it again.\n* The “Play lead-in” option in Exercise Options for Singing exercises is now grayed out when a question requires that it is enabled. Before, the option was available but changing it had no effect.\n* Exercise Setup with a custom pitch range: tapping on the lower range option would play the wrong interval. This has now been fixed.\n* The pitch detection system could display an error on rare occasions. \n* Exercises where tempo was controlled by an Exercise Setup: changing the tempo in Exercise Options only worked if done while recording an answer. It would then be reset on each attempt or if the lesson intro was displayed again. Now the tempo is only reset when a new question is generated.\n* In-App store: the purchase buttons with prices could take a long time to load. It should go much faster now. \n* The Beginner’s course used half-note rests in 3/4 meters.

I’m currently using the exercises (after purchasing the bundle). It’s really worth the money imho. One thing I’ve noticed though that I didn’t like so far is in the Chord inversions exercise when I make a mistake whether it was an augmented chord and not a diminished one, it logically should show the difference between the different chord types for the SAME key in my opinion and not based on the first note you hear. Or is there some kind of a setting where this can be changed?\nOtherwise, so far, I’m a very happy user.

I own the PC/Mac version and you can create your own custom chords like polychords, tone clusters, random quintal quartal chords, and atonal stuff, however you want it, that’s one of the main reason I use this app, is the flexibility that on other app has. But that feature is not available on the Ipad version. I bought a ipad pro thinking that i can use it to train my ear wherever I go. I would totally pay some bucks to get that feature tho.\n\n2. In earmaster 6, the entire piano keyboard is shown, but for some reason, in earmaster 7, the developers decided to only show the keyboard partially, and if you do chords and intervals that span over a few octaves, you have to constantly browse back and forth to input the answers, WHY?\n\nIt’s only a downgrade from earmaster 6.

However, the setting was removed from Exercise Options, so you could not disable it again.\n* The “Play lead-in” option in Exercise Options for Singing exercises is now grayed out when a question requires that it is enabled. Before, the option was available but changing it had no effect.\n* Exercise Setup with a custom pitch range: tapping on the lower range option would play the wrong interval. This has now been fixed.\n* The pitch detection system could display an error on rare occasions. \n* Exercises where tempo was controlled by an Exercise Setup: changing the tempo in Exercise Options only worked if done while recording an answer. It would then be reset on each attempt or if the lesson intro was displayed again. Now the tempo is only reset when a new question is generated.\n* In-App store: the purchase buttons with prices could take a long time to load. It should go much faster now. \n* The Beginner’s course used half-note rests in 3/4 meters.

This however also means that additional or missing trailing rests no longer count either (it was a problem in e.g. Jazz Workshops lesson 1.4)\n+ Melodic Dictation with pitch-only melodies: if you enter more tones than expected, you are now subtracted a half correct pitch for that.\n+ Real-time exercises (sing-back, clap-back and sight-reading): a question can now be repeated and answered an unlimited number of times, but only the first answer counts in the results. Additional attempts are for practicing and self-evaluation only.    \n+ Chord Identification: with input of individual tones on the Piano, Guitar and Functional Keyboard, EarMaster is now much better at picking the right accidentals.\n+ Interval Comparison now transcribes questions without using double accidentals.\n+ Melodic Dictation: the staff now gets a larger portion of the screen.\n\n[New Languages]\n+ Russian (except Jazz Workshops)\n+ Polish\n\n[Bug fixes]\n- Melody Sing-back in continuous call-answer mode: After repeating the same question and then automatically moving on to a new question, some extra tones were played.\n- Melodic Dictation: after a sequence of certain lessons, the app could enter into an error state with error messages about accidentals.\n- The \"Auto New Question\" threshold setting was not working correctly.\n- Melodic Dictation: when a melody from the score library is defined in C with accidentals, e.g. Blues Scale, EarMaster used to guess the wrong accidentals. The problem was seen in e.g. Jazz Workshops - Melodic Dictation - Lesson 1.1, question 2, which is using the C blues scale. The tone defined as Gb was inserted via the Piano as F#.\n- Quarter note rest could be cut at the bottom in some cases.\n- Double rests in auto-generated rhythms with certain configurations are now always correct.\n- Remote control by MIDI-In has been disabled, as there is no interface to configure and disable it\n- With longer notes and at lower tempo, the duration of pauses between notes could exceed length of a 16th note, which could be confusing in Rhythm Dictation exercises.\n- Interval Singing: when answering wrong, it did not show the name of the interval that you gave as the answer.\n- Interval Singing: \"Unison\" is no longer shown as \"Unison (up)\" (changed for both question and answer).\n- Rhythm Clap-back in continuous call-response mode: when moving on to the next question, the first clap was sometimes played twice quickly after each other.\n- Tapping a note to tie it to another one made it remain gray.\n- Deleting a tied note caused the next inserted note to be tied too.","releaseDate":"2019-05-28"},{"versionDisplay":"1.0.17","releaseNotes":"We've been busy since last time!

You can also activate the 'Silent Input' option in Exercise Options if the clap sounds are also delayed. \n* The 'Play Tonic' options '123454321' and 'Ascending Scale' now play the actual scale that the question is based on (before it was always the major scale).\n* Melodic exercises with melodies generated from Church Modes: Playing root harmonies before the question ('I-IV-V-I Cadence' and 'Root Chord') now uses minor when the mode is minor (e.g. Dorian)\n* In Customized Exercise Setup, pressing 'Play' on a 'Play Tonic of key' type now plays minor/major depending on the selected scale (for melodic exercises)\n* Scale Identification: The \"Random order\" execution now defaults to always play the tonic as first tone (all existing lessons and customized exercises keep old behavior)\n* MIDI out: When not using the default SoundFont for percussions sounds, you can now choose the full range of General MIDI instruments (0..127) (e.g. for metronome)\n\nBugfixes\n* MIDI input when the exercise is paused (e.g. when showing lesson intro) no longer shows the message \"Exercise is paused\"\n* Turning on 'Evaluate note length' forced the Piano to be shown even though it is not a valid option, making it impossible to use clap exercises with the 'Evaluate note length' option.\n* Solved an error when moving on to a next lesson that was an instruction lesson\n* Melody Singback with 'Continous call-response' and using MIDI or on-screen instruments to answer: when holding a tone after the end of a bar, the input and progress of call-answer would lock up.\n* Imitation exercises (Melodic + Rhythmic) with 'Continous call-response' enabled: could stop receiving input after having completed one lesson.\n* Scale Identification with the chromatic scale played in random order did not work\n* Chord Progression exercises with 'Silent input' enabled: When answered you could only hear your own answer once, and the multiple choice buttons did not play at all.\n* In Chord Progression exercises, MIDI input now also works when 'Silent input' is active.\n* Sight-reading exercises with 'Auto begin record' enabled: played a metronome click when showing the lesson introduction.\n* Exercise options: If 'Auto new question' was enabled when entering a lesson, then 'Auto begin record' would remain disabled even if 'Auto new question' was disabled again.\n* Solved an error message shown in some lessons of the RCM course (e.g. 4.16)\n* iPad home screen: the position of the spinning wheel on the Begin button has been adjusted","releaseDate":"2018-06-29"},{"versionDisplay":"1.0.15","releaseNotes":"Solved bug in previous update that caused notes to have an offset on iOS 11 (did not happen on iOS 10 or earlier)","releaseDate":"2018-04-02"},{"versionDisplay":"1.0.14","releaseNotes":"Hooray, a new update is ready!
