    Great catalogue , super buggy app tho

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>First the good. This streaming service really delivers for the price as far as content goes. The overall selection of movies and shows contains more a list movies than any of the other services and it’s not filled with overflow of b movies most other services seem to offer. Of course the HBO original content is always top bar. Hard to complain about the quality of material on here. Overall the movies stream just fine on my roku and iPad, and I don’t have blazing fast top dollar internet either.<br /><br />Second, the bad. Man this app feels real buggy. The app loads slow, changing between genres loads slow(like one of those webpages with way too many advertisements on it). Even accessing the basic navigation moves slow. Every click left, right up or down just takes a minute to register, and once it does it fires off how ever many times you click, so only click the arrow once, then just wait for it to catch up. Finally I do not even attempt to watch trailers anymore, as it always crashes my roku. I sure hope HBO is tackling these issues as it seems I am not the only one.<br /><br />Again I will say, I have no issues when it comes to the steaming of movies and shows, which to me is the most important thing. But for a premium app that’s in the $13 a month ballpark I would expect a better overall product. Adding a scene selection feature to movies would be very nice too.</p>

    Edit: Issue Resolved - Apple TV Version Broken
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>After the most recent update the standard Apple TV scrubbing has been replaced with a version that is nearly unusable. Clicking the far right or left of the remote’s touchpad no longer skips forward/back, tapping no longer brings up the time bar, and swiping on the touchpad scrubs without the need for pausing and at a speed that makes it nearly impossible to move to an accurate time (it seems that now the width of the touch pad relates to the entire time bar so that, starting from the beginning of an episode, one swipe from left to right will take you to the end of the episode/movie). The last point causes problems because you need to swipe on the touch pad to bring up the time bar, and I’ve accidentally skipped most of the way through what I’m watching when only trying to see how much is left. This along with the removal of support for 15s skips (which is standard for any streaming service) makes it very difficult to move forward or back a short amount of time. Additionally, the Play Next Episode function is somewhat broken on both Apple TV and iOS. On Apple TV it isn’t possible to swipe to the button, and attempting to click on it seems to both pause whatever’s playing and move to the next episode, almost as if the two fields were selected at this same time. This makes it impossible to pause at the end of an episode once Next Episode has appeared, and equally impossible to move away from the next episode button.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Ok app overall at first but start to use heavy especially on iPhone 11 air playing to Apple TV - I have noticed a few bugs centered around airplaying that need to be addressed ASAP.   First the buffering could be improved greatly especially at the first 5, 8, 15 or so minutes and around 37th- 45th minutes.  If you watch series like DC Titans or others- the  app hangs when switching to next episode - this happens quite often - app continually becomes unresponsive and has to be exited. I played around with security or screen lock to see if this affects but have yet definite conclusion as to the cause! Also each episode starts with the Audio description enabled. EACH time a new episode starts it resets the audio description to on!  The only way I have found to turn it off is to toggle audio description on then to English or Spanish then back off.  Gets old doing this each time. Also happens with some of the newer movies too.  Regression test app with older Apple TV’s as it does this on earlier Gen Apple TV’s too. Does it on my older model A1469!  In short refine and streamline the apps airplay abilities for a more enjoyable seamless streaming experience.  Thxs in advance happy coding and regression testing :) 👍😎</p>

This information may include personal information (e.g., name, phone number, postal address, email address, and certain payment information), technical information (e.g., technical information, including device identifier, IP address, browser type, operating system) and usage information (e.g., how you use and navigate to and from our Sites, and information about content or advertisements you have been shown or have clicked on). We may combine these types of information together, and collectively refer to all of this information in this Privacy Policy as \"Information.\" Information may be collected as described below and through the use of cookies, web beacons, pixels, and other similar technologies by us or by other companies on our behalf. Below we describe the types of Information we may collect:\n\nRegistration, account, and sign-up information. We may collect Information in the course of your use of, or registration with, our Sites. For example, when you create an account, register for or download an application, or sign-up for a product or service, you may provide us with certain personal information. This type of personal information may include: name, phone number, postal address, fax number, email address, or certain payment information (e.g., credit card and billing information). We may also receive Information about your interest in and use of various products, programs, services, and content available on or through our Sites.\n\nOther information you provide to us. On some Sites, you may share other information about yourself by, for example, publishing and sharing the information with the Site's website or in the Site's community. Sometimes you may also choose to provide more sensitive forms of personal information to us, such as information regarding your physical or mental health, biometric data, race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, or trade union membership. For example, we may collect this type of sensitive information if you participate in surveys, focus groups, or opportunities to test new products, programs, or services. We collect this sensitive information with your consent, if required by law, and we take special steps to protect and limit any use of it to the purposes for which it is provided.\n\nInformation about others/inviting friends. On some of our Sites, we may collect Information you submit about other people. For example, you might submit Information to invite a friend to participate in an offering, make recommendations, or share content. By processing these requests, we may receive the other person's Information, including a recipient's name, postal address, email address, telephone number, or information about the recipient's interest in and use of various products, programs, services, and content. Some of our Sites also allow you to invite your friends to participate in activities by providing their contact details or importing contacts from your address book or from other sites.\n\nInformation from other sources. We may, on occasion, combine Information we receive online with other information, including usage information from our other Sites and our online advertising and media. We may also supplement or combine Information with information from a variety of other sources or outside records, such as demographic, transaction history, or personal information, and we may use that combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n\nSocial media. You can engage with some of our content and offerings, such as videos, games, applications, and other offerings on or through third party communities, forums, and social media sites, services, plug-ins, and applications (\"Social Media Sites\"). When you link to or interact with our Sites or content through Social Media Sites, you may allow us to receive certain Information from your social media account (e.g., name, user ID, email address, profile photo, photos and videos, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends and their contact details, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the 'likes' you make). We may also receive Information from your interaction with our content (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements you have been shown or have clicked on). By providing this Information or otherwise interacting with our Sites through Social Media Sites, you consent to our use of Information from the Social Media Site in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n\nPublic forums. If you post or share Information or content, such as photos, letters, videos, or comments, while participating in online forums on our Sites, or when you interact with our Sites through Social Media Sites, depending on your privacy settings this Information and your username may become public on the Internet or within a community of users. We cannot prevent further use of this Information once it is made public.

We may have access to certain Information about your location, such as your country or address, when you provide it or via device information (such as an IP address).

For some Sites, we will ask for permission to access your device's camera. If you grant permission, you may be able to take pictures or video within the app experience or to access certain augmented reality (\"AR\") features. Some of these features may rely on camera systems to track movements of your eyes and other facial features or your immediate surroundings to apply AR effects. Information gathered from facial scanning technology, e.g. TrueDepth API, is only used to make these services and features available to you and is only persistent on the device during use of the AR features. Facial data is not stored on our systems nor shared with any third party.\n\nVideo viewing information. For some Sites, we collect information about the films, TV shows and URLs that you view.\n\nTechnical and usage information.

We use Information about you to communicate with you, such as (i) to notify you when you win one of our contests or sweepstakes or when we make changes to our policies or user agreements, (ii) to respond to your inquiries, (iii) to communicate with you about your purchases or transactions, (iv) to contact you about your account, or (v) to send you information about promotions, offerings, and Site features. You may also choose to receive push notifications from us on your mobile device. If you choose to submit content for publication online or in other forums, we may publish your screen name and other Information you have provided to us on our Sites, the Internet, or elsewhere. We use Information that you provide about others to enable us to send them invitations, promotions, or other content on your behalf or through our Sites. From time to time, we also may use this Information to offer, market, or advertise products, programs, or services to them from us and our affiliates, business partners, and select third parties.\n\nUse of technical and usage information. We use technical and usage information to improve the design, functionality and content of our Sites and to enable us to personalize your experience with our Sites and offerings.

We may use Information we collect to detect, investigate, and prevent activities on our Sites that may violate our terms of use, could be fraudulent, violate copyright, or other rules or that may be otherwise illegal, to comply with legal requirements, and to protect our rights and the rights and safety of our users and others.\n\nInformation Sharing and Disclosure\n\nWe may share and disclose Information in the following ways or for any other purpose disclosed at the time of collection:\n\nWith your consent. We may disclose Information when you provide us with your consent to do so.\n\nLegal and law enforcement purposes.

We also may disclose such Information to third parties: (i) in connection with fraud prevention activities, (ii) where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, (iii) in situations that may involve violations of our terms of use or other rules, (iv) to protect our rights and the rights and safety of others, and (v) as otherwise required by law.\n\nChange of control. We may transfer Information in the event of a business transaction, such as if we or one of our business units or our relevant assets are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding or a business reorganization.\n\nService providers. Our agents and contractors may have access to Information to help carry out the services they are performing for us, such as, but not limited to, creation, maintenance, hosting, and delivery of our Sites, products, and services, conduct marketing, handle payments, email and order fulfillment, administer contests, conduct research and analytics, or customer service.\n\nAffiliates. We may disclose Information to affiliates. For example, we may share Information we collect with our affiliates to provide, improve, offer, market, and otherwise communicate with you about their own products and services. Our products and services may be developed, managed, marketed and sold by a variety of our affiliates. We share Information that may identify you personally internally among affiliates publicly recognized as a WarnerMedia affiliate, such as Xandr and the AT\u0026T family of companies. A list of our publicly recognized WarnerMedia affiliates is found here. Public recognition may derive from, for example, use of common branding elements, advertising, press, social media reports or other public form of notice. We require the affiliate to protect the Information consistent with this Policy. For affiliates not publicly recognized as WarnerMedia affiliates, we share Information under the same circumstances and limitations that we impose when we share with non-WarnerMedia companies, like vendors performing services on our behalf. We may also combine Information that identifies you personally with data that comes from an app or affiliate that has a different privacy policy. When we do that, our Policy applies to the combined data set.\n\nBusiness partners and third parties. We may also share Information with business partners and third parties (e.g., other companies, retailers, research organizations, advertisers, ad agencies, advertising networks and platforms, participatory databases, publishers, and non-profit organizations) that may want to market products or services to you. If we share personal information with such unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes, we provide you with an opportunity to opt out of such uses either at the point of collection or through the choice mechanisms set forth in this Privacy Policy. To learn more about your choices, please see Your Choices and Your Controls below.\n\nLinked sites. Some of our Sites contain links to other sites, including Social Media Sites, whose information practices may be different from ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy policies and terms before submitting any Information, as we have no control over Information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.\n\nSponsors and co-promotions. We may sometimes offer content or programs (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications or Social Media Site integrations) that are sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may collect or obtain Information from visitors that participate in the activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this Information. We encourage you to visit the privacy policy of any such third party to learn about their data practices.\n\nAdvertising networks. We may share certain information with third parties to provide advertising to you based on your interests. For more information, please see Ad Choices below.\n\nYour Choices\n\nMarketing communications and sharing with third parties. We provide you with an opportunity to express your preferences with respect to receiving certain marketing communications from us, and our sharing of personal information with unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you ever decide in the future that you would like to update these preferences, you may (i) log in to an account you have created with us at one of our Sites to adjust your settings, or (ii) send us an email at privacy@hbomax.com. To opt out of receiving our email marketing communications, you can also follow the \"unsubscribe\" instructions provided in any marketing email you receive from us. If you previously chose to receive push notifications on your mobile device from us, but no longer wish to receive them, you can manage your preferences through your device or app settings, depending on the type of device. If you have signed up to receive text messages from us and no longer wish to receive such messages, you may follow the instructions to stop the delivery of such messages, which may include by replying \"STOP\" to the received text message. For California residents, please see below for additional information on the choices we provide to you.\n\nAd Choices. We may work with reputable third parties to present advertisements, and engage in data collection, reporting, ad delivery and response measurement, and site analytics on our Sites and on third party websites across the Internet and applications over time. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, or similar technologies to perform this activity. They may also obtain information about applications you use, websites you visit, and other information from across your devices and browsers in order to help serve advertising that may be more relevant to your interests on and off our Sites and across your devices and browsers. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising. They may also use this information to associate various browsers and devices together for the purpose of interest-based advertising and other purposes like analytics.\n\nFor more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser, and your ability to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in self-regulatory programs, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative and/or the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about interest-based advertising in mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA's AppChoices tool, please download the version of AppChoices for your device here. Please note that any opt-out choice you exercise through these programs will apply to interest-based advertising by the third parties you select, but will still allow the collection of data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations. You may continue to receive advertising, but that advertising may be less relevant to your interests.\n\nYou may have more options depending on your mobile device and operating system. For example, most device operating systems (e.g., iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to learn more about these features and how they apply to tailored in-app advertisements.\n\nPrecise location information. To disable the collection of precise location information from your mobile device through our mobile apps, you can access your mobile device settings and choose to limit that collection.\n\nSee also Cookies and Other Technical Information for more choices about managing other technical and usage information.\n\nCookies and Other Technical Information\n\nCookies and other technologies. We, and our affiliates, third party service providers, and business partners may send \"cookies\" to your computer or use similar technologies to understand and enhance your online experience at our Sites and through our advertising and media across the Internet and mobile apps.\n\nCookies are small text files placed in your browser. We may also use pixels or \"web beacons\" that monitor your use of our Sites. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a webpage for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser that fetched the web beacon, and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. We may also integrate \"Software Development Kits\" (\"SDKs\") into our applications to perform similar functions as cookies and web beacons. For example, SDKs may collect technical and usage information such as mobile device identifiers and your interactions with the Site and other mobile apps.\n\nWe may use cookies and other technologies to help recognize your browser or device, maintain your preferences, provide certain Site features, and collect Information about interactions with our Sites, our content, and our communications. For example, when corresponding with you via HTML capable email, web beacons and other technologies let us know about your activity, including whether you received and opened our email, clicked through a link, or otherwise interacted with our content, and this information may be associated with Information previously collected.\n\nWe may also use cookies and other technologies (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our Sites, products, programs, and services and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our Sites and marketing materials, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, (v) to synchronize users across devices, affiliates, business partners, and select third parties, and (vi) for us and our affiliates, business partners, and select third parties to target, offer, market, or advertise products, programs, or services. Cookies and other technologies also facilitate, manage, and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us and/or other networks or sites. By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we send to you.\n\nManaging cookies and other technologies. Cookies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser).

However, no security measures are perfect and we cannot assure you that personal information that we collect will never be accessed or used in in an unauthorized way.\n\nHow You Can Access or Correct Information\n\nTo access the personal information that we have collected about you online from Sites on which this Privacy Policy is posted or to update your user profile, please log into your account if you have created one with us or send an email to privacy@hbomax.com. For California residents, please see below for additional information on accessing information about you.\n\nAdditional Information Regarding Children's Privacy\n\nVisitors to this Site may participate in many activities without providing any personal information. However, in some cases if a user wants to participate in certain of our interactive features, we may ask the user to register and/or provide us with the user's age information and, in some cases, email address. If the person who registers indicates that he or she is under 13 years old, as permitted by law we will (i) collect no or limited personal information (e.g. email address only) from that individual, (ii) inform the child that a parent's verifiable consent is required, and/or (iii) collect the email address of the user's parent in addition to the user's email address. We use the parent's email address to seek the parent's verifiable consent or notify the parent of his/her child's online activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe his/her child from a newsletter or other similar activity. Once a parent provides consent, we may use any information from the child consistent with the rest of this Privacy Policy and/or the terms of the consent provided by the parent. If a user is under 13, we will not condition his/her participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. If you would like to review any personal information that we have collected online from your child, have this personal information deleted from our active servers, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child's personal information, or if you have questions about these information practices, you may contact us at privacy@hbomax.com, or at Warner Media, LLC, 30 Hudson Yards, New York NY 10001.\n\nInternational Transfer\n\nWe operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States, this means Information we collect will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you use or visit our Sites from outside the United States, you consent to the collection and/or processing in the United States of Information we collect from you.\n\nNotification Regarding Privacy Policy Updates\n\nFrom time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. We will notify you about changes to this Privacy Policy by placing a notice on our Sites. We encourage you to periodically check back and review this Privacy Policy so that you always know our current privacy practices.\n\nHow to Contact Us\n\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy you may contact us at: privacy@hbomax.com or at or Warner Media, LLC, 30 Hudson Yards, New York NY 10001.\n\nCalifornia and CCPA Privacy Rights and Disclosures\n\nThis California Privacy Rights and Disclosure section addresses legal obligations and rights laid out in the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA.

According to this broad definition, in the year before the date this policy was issued, for some Sites we may have sold the following categories of California Information:\n\nAddress and other identifiers – such as name, postal address, email address, account name, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers\nUnique and online identifiers – IP address, device IDs, or other similar identifiers\nCommercial information – such as records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies\nInternet, gaming or other electronic network activity information – such as browsing history, search history, and information regarding an individual's interaction with an internet website, application, or advertisement\nLocation information - (e.g. if you access our Sites on your mobile device we may collect Information about your device's precise location.)\nInferences drawn from California Information, such as individual profiles, preferences, characteristics, behaviors.\nYour California privacy rights to request disclosure of information we collect and share about you. If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information about our practices related to the disclosure of your personal information by certain members of the WarnerMedia Family of Companies to certain third parties for their direct marketing purposes. You may be able to opt-out of our sharing of your personal information with unaffiliated third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes in certain circumstances. Please send your request (along with your full name, email address, postal address, and the subject line labeled \"Your California Privacy Rights\") by email at WMPrivacy@warnermediagroup.com.\n\nIn addition, if you are a California resident, the CCPA grants you the right to request certain information about our practices with respect to California Information. In particular, you can request the following:\n\nThe categories and specific pieces of your California Information that we've collected\nThe categories of sources from which we collected California Information\nThe business or commercial purposes for which we collected or sold California Information\nThe categories of third parties with which we shared California Information.\nYou can submit a request to us for the following additional information:\n\nThe categories of third parties to which we've sold California Information, and the category or categories of California Information sold to each.\nThe categories of California Information that we've shared with service providers who provide services for us, like processing your bill.\nTo exercise your CCPA rights with respect to this information, either visit here or contact us toll free at 833-WM-PRVCY (833-967-7829) or TTY: 833-PRVCY-TT (833-778-2988). These requests for disclosure are generally free.\n\nYour right to request the deletion of California information. Upon your request, we will delete the California Information we have collected about you, except for situations when that information is necessary for us to: provide you with a product or service that you requested; perform a contract we entered into with you; maintain the functionality or security of our systems; comply with or exercise rights provided by the law; or use the information internally in ways that are compatible with the context in which you provided the information to us, or that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us.\n\nTo exercise your right to request the deletion of your California Information, either visit here or contact us toll free at 833-WM-PRVCY (833-967-7829) or TTY: 833-PRVCY-TT (833-778-2988).

Once we receive and process your request, we will not sell your California Information unless you later allow us to do so.\n\nDo not track notice.

See the Your Choices section to learn how to control data collection for certain purposes.\n\nOur support for the exercise your data rights. We are committed to providing you control over your California Information. If you exercise any of these rights explained in this section of the Privacy Policy, we will not disadvantage you. You will not be denied or charged different prices or rates for goods or services or provided a different level or quality of goods or services.\n\nConsumers under 16 years old. CCPA has specific rules regarding the use of California Information from consumers under 16 years of age. In particular, consistent with the CCPA, if we knowingly collect the California Information of a consumer under the age of 16, we will not sell the information unless we receive affirmative permission to do so. If the consumer is between the ages of 13 and 16 years of age, the consumer may provide that permission; if the consumer is under the age of 13, the consumer's parent or guardian must provide the permission.\n\nIf you would like further information on how we handle California Information from consumers under the age of 16 years of age, or if you have questions about these information practices, you may contact us at wmprivacy@warnermediagroup.com, or at WarnerMedia Privacy Office, 4000 Warner Blvd., Bldg. 160, Burbank, CA 91522.\n\nHBO Max Children's Privacy Policy\n\nThis Children's Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices parents can make about information collected through Kid's Profiles within our HBO Max Platform. The word \"Platform\" in this Children's Privacy Policy has the meaning set forth in the Terms of Use.\n\nOther portions of our Platform are for adults. You should take a look at our General Audience Privacy Policy for more information about how we will collect and use data outside Kid's Profiles on the Platform. It is important to set up a Kid's Profile for your child under 18 because the information practices for these Kid's Profiles, which are described in this Children's Privacy Policy, are different than for adult profiles.\n\nWhat Information Do We Collect From Kid Profiles?\n\n\nInformation about child users:\nWhen you make a Kid's Profile, we will ask for some information about your child, like their first name and a profile photo (where available).  You can also exercise parental controls over your child's use of the profile, like the kinds of shows and movies they can watch and how to switch between the profiles on your HBO Max account.\n\nTechnical and usage information:\nWhen any user visits or uses our Platform, we will get some information about their device and their internet browser (for example, Safari, Chrome or Firefox). We will also get some information about their IP Address, device identifiers, and how they use our Platform. To learn more, see our section about Cookies.\n\nWhen users contact us:\nIf your child contacts us by email or using an online form, we will ask them for some information. For example, this may include their first name and email address and the reason they are contacting us. Once we have completed their request, we will delete their information.\n\nHow Do We Use Information?\n\nWe use the information we collect through a Kid's Profile for the purposes described in this Children's Privacy Policy or disclosed at the time of collection or with your consent, to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\nProviding and marketing products and services. We use the information we collect through a Kid's Profile within our Platform to provide the Platform; to analyze use of our Platform; and to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve the user experience and our offerings. For example, we use information collected from a Kid's Profile within our Platform to enable your child to watch trailers, movies, programs, and video clips and find others that may interest them within the Kid's Profile. We may also use the information we collect to show offers and advertisements based on what your child is watching.\n\nCommunicating with you and others. We use the information we collect to communicate with you or respond to your child's requests, such as (i) to notify you when you win one of our contests or sweepstakes or when we make changes to our policies or user agreements, (ii) to respond to your (and your child's) inquiries and customer support requests, (iii) to communicate with you about your purchases or transactions, or (iv) to contact you about your account (including your child's activity on the account), or (v) to send you information about promotions, offerings, and Platform features.\n\nUse of technical and usage information. We use technical and usage information to improve the design, functionality and content of our Platform and to enable us to personalize your child's experience with our Platform. We use this information (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our content and our Platform, products, and programs and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our Platform and content, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, and (iv) for us to show offers and advertisements based on what your child is watching.\n\nCompliance. We may use the information we collect to detect, investigate, and prevent activities on our Platform that may violate our terms of use, could be fraudulent, violate copyright, or other rules or that may be otherwise illegal, to comply with legal requirements, and to protect our rights and the rights and safety of our users and others.\n\nHow Do We Share Information?\n\nWhen permitted by law, we may share and disclose the information we collect from a Kid's Profile in the following ways or for any other purpose disclosed at the time of collection:\n\nWith your consent. We may disclose this information when you provide us with your consent to do so or, if permitted by law, when the child provides consent.\n\nLegal and law enforcement purposes. We may disclose information in response to legal process, for example in response to a court order or a subpoena, or in response to a law enforcement agency's request. We also may disclose such information to third parties: (i) in connection with fraud prevention activities, (ii) where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, (iii) in situations that may involve violations of our terms of use or other rules, (iv) to protect our rights and the rights and safety of others, and (v) as otherwise required by law.\n\nChange of control. We may transfer the information we collect in the event of a business transaction, such as if we or one of our business units or our relevant assets are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding or a business reorganization.\n\nService providers. Our agents and contractors may have access to information to help carry out the services they are performing for us, such as, but not limited to, creating, maintaining, hosting, and delivering the Platform and our products, and services; conducting marketing, handling payments, email and order fulfillment; administering contests; conducting research and analytics; or customer service.\n\nAffiliates. We may disclose information collected through a Kid's  Profile to affiliates in some cases, such as when the affiliates act like service providers performing services on our behalf. You can find a list of some of the affiliated WarnerMedia companies here. We may update this list from time-to-time, so please check back periodically to keep up-to-date.\n\nLinked sites. Some parts of our Platform contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different from ours. Information your child submits to other sites will be governed by the other sites' privacy policies and terms.\n\nCookies And Other Technologies\n\nCookies and other technologies. We, and our service providers, may send \"cookies\" or use similar technologies to understand and personalize your child's online experience in our Platform or for advertising within the Platform based on the content your child is watching.\n\nCookies are small text files placed in a browser. We may also use pixels or \"web beacons\" that monitor your child's use of our Platform for the purposes noted above. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a webpage for the purpose of transferring data. We may also integrate \"Software Development Kits\" (\"SDKs\") into our applications to perform similar functions as cookies and web beacons. For example, SDKs may collect technical and usage information such as mobile device identifiers and your interactions with the Platform.\n\nWe may also use cookies and other technologies (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our content and our Platform, products, and programs and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our Platform and content, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, and (v) for us to offer, market, or advertise products, programs, or services.\n\nManaging cookies and other technologies. Cookies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). Check your browser settings to learn how to delete cookies.\n\nYou may adjust a browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Controlling cookies via browser controls may not limit our use of other technologies. Please consult the browser's settings for more information. However, blocking cookies or similar technology might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Platform features.\n\nSome of our sites may use Google Analytics to analyze traffic. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage. To opt-out of Google Analytics relating to your child's use of our Platform, you can download and install the Browser Plugin available via this link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.\n\nWe do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.\n\nInternational Transfer\n\nWe operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States. This means the information we collect will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. The Platform is currently limited to accounts in the United States. However, if your child uses or visits our Platform from outside the United States, you consent to the collection and/or processing in the United States of information we collect from them.\n\nSecurity\n\nWe take reasonable steps to help safeguard the information we collect. However, no security measures are perfect, and we cannot assure you that personal information that we collect will never be accessed or used in in an unauthorized way.\n\nYour Rights\n\nYou can make certain requests regarding the personal information we collect from your child.  For instance, you may access this information, request that we delete it, and/or prohibit us from further collecting or using any information from your child. You or your adult can make these requests through our online portal here.\n\nYour California Rights\n\nCalifornia has passed a law named the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which grants California residents certain rights with respect to their personal information. The CCPA has specific rules regarding the use of children's information. In particular, the CCPA says that a parent or guardian must provide permission to sell personal information of users under the age of 13. It also allows you to ask for access to the information collected from a Kid's Profile or to ask us to delete it. Users aged 13-15 can provide permission or exercise these access and deletion rights directly. If you are interested in the rights that the CCPA grants to California residents, please visit the \"California and CCPA Privacy Rights and Disclosures\" section of the WarnerMedia Privacy Policy here.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you have any questions about this Children's Privacy Policy you may contact us at: WMPrivacy@warnermediagroup.com or write to us at the following address:\n\nWarnerMedia Privacy Office\nAttention: Chief Privacy Officer\n4000 Warner Blvd., Bldg. 160\nBurbank, CA 91522\nUnited States\n\n833- WM-PRVCY (833-967-7829) or 833-PRVCY-TT (833-778-2988)\nWMPrivacy@warnermediagroup.com\n\nUPDATES\n\nFrom time to time, we may update this Children's Privacy Policy.

Below we describe the types of Information we may collect:\n\nRegistration, account, and sign-up information. We may collect Information in the course of your use of, or registration with, our Sites. For example, when you create an account, register for or download an application, or sign-up for a product or service, you may provide us with certain personal information. This type of personal information may include: name, phone number, postal address, fax number, email address, or certain payment information (e.g., credit card and billing information).

Sometimes you may also choose to provide more sensitive forms of personal information to us, such as information regarding your physical or mental health, biometric data, race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, or trade union membership. For example, we may collect this type of sensitive information if you participate in surveys, focus groups, or opportunities to test new products, programs, or services. We collect this sensitive information with your consent, if required by law, and we take special steps to protect and limit any use of it to the purposes for which it is provided.\n\nInformation about others/inviting friends. On some of our Sites, we may collect Information you submit about other people. For example, you might submit Information to invite a friend to participate in an offering, make recommendations, or share content. By processing these requests, we may receive the other person's Information, including a recipient's name, postal address, email address, telephone number, or information about the recipient's interest in and use of various products, programs, services, and content. Some of our Sites also allow you to invite your friends to participate in activities by providing their contact details or importing contacts from your address book or from other sites.\n\nInformation from other sources. We may, on occasion, combine Information we receive online with other information, including usage information from our other Sites and our online advertising and media.

We may disclose Information to affiliates. For example, we may share Information we collect with our affiliates to provide, improve, offer, market, and otherwise communicate with you about their own products and services. Our products and services may be developed, managed, marketed and sold by a variety of our affiliates. We share Information that may identify you personally internally among affiliates publicly recognized as a WarnerMedia affiliate, such as Xandr and the AT\u0026T family of companies. A list of our publicly recognized WarnerMedia affiliates is found here. Public recognition may derive from, for example, use of common branding elements, advertising, press, social media reports or other public form of notice. We require the affiliate to protect the Information consistent with this Policy. For affiliates not publicly recognized as WarnerMedia affiliates, we share Information under the same circumstances and limitations that we impose when we share with non-WarnerMedia companies, like vendors performing services on our behalf. We may also combine Information that identifies you personally with data that comes from an app or affiliate that has a different privacy policy. When we do that, our Policy applies to the combined data set.\n\nBusiness partners and third parties. We may also share Information with business partners and third parties (e.g., other companies, retailers, research organizations, advertisers, ad agencies, advertising networks and platforms, participatory databases, publishers, and non-profit organizations) that may want to market products or services to you. If we share personal information with such unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes, we provide you with an opportunity to opt out of such uses either at the point of collection or through the choice mechanisms set forth in this Privacy Policy. To learn more about your choices, please see Your Choices and Your Controls below.\n\nLinked sites. Some of our Sites contain links to other sites, including Social Media Sites, whose information practices may be different from ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy policies and terms before submitting any Information, as we have no control over Information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.\n\nSponsors and co-promotions. We may sometimes offer content or programs (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications or Social Media Site integrations) that are sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may collect or obtain Information from visitors that participate in the activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this Information. We encourage you to visit the privacy policy of any such third party to learn about their data practices.\n\nAdvertising networks. We may share certain information with third parties to provide advertising to you based on your interests. For more information, please see Ad Choices below.\n\nYour Choices\n\nMarketing communications and sharing with third parties. We provide you with an opportunity to express your preferences with respect to receiving certain marketing communications from us, and our sharing of personal information with unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you ever decide in the future that you would like to update these preferences, you may (i) log in to an account you have created with us at one of our Sites to adjust your settings, or (ii) send us an email at privacy@hbomax.com. To opt out of receiving our email marketing communications, you can also follow the \"unsubscribe\" instructions provided in any marketing email you receive from us. If you previously chose to receive push notifications on your mobile device from us, but no longer wish to receive them, you can manage your preferences through your device or app settings, depending on the type of device. If you have signed up to receive text messages from us and no longer wish to receive such messages, you may follow the instructions to stop the delivery of such messages, which may include by replying \"STOP\" to the received text message. For California residents, please see below for additional information on the choices we provide to you.\n\nAd Choices. We may work with reputable third parties to present advertisements, and engage in data collection, reporting, ad delivery and response measurement, and site analytics on our Sites and on third party websites across the Internet and applications over time. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, or similar technologies to perform this activity. They may also obtain information about applications you use, websites you visit, and other information from across your devices and browsers in order to help serve advertising that may be more relevant to your interests on and off our Sites and across your devices and browsers. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising. They may also use this information to associate various browsers and devices together for the purpose of interest-based advertising and other purposes like analytics.\n\nFor more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser, and your ability to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in self-regulatory programs, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative and/or the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about interest-based advertising in mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA's AppChoices tool, please download the version of AppChoices for your device here. Please note that any opt-out choice you exercise through these programs will apply to interest-based advertising by the third parties you select, but will still allow the collection of data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations. You may continue to receive advertising, but that advertising may be less relevant to your interests.\n\nYou may have more options depending on your mobile device and operating system. For example, most device operating systems (e.g., iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to learn more about these features and how they apply to tailored in-app advertisements.\n\nPrecise location information. To disable the collection of precise location information from your mobile device through our mobile apps, you can access your mobile device settings and choose to limit that collection.\n\nSee also Cookies and Other Technical Information for more choices about managing other technical and usage information.\n\nCookies and Other Technical Information\n\nCookies and other technologies.

We may also use pixels or \"web beacons\" that monitor your use of our Sites. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a webpage for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser that fetched the web beacon, and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. We may also integrate \"Software Development Kits\" (\"SDKs\") into our applications to perform similar functions as cookies and web beacons. For example, SDKs may collect technical and usage information such as mobile device identifiers and your interactions with the Site and other mobile apps.\n\nWe may use cookies and other technologies to help recognize your browser or device, maintain your preferences, provide certain Site features, and collect Information about interactions with our Sites, our content, and our communications. For example, when corresponding with you via HTML capable email, web beacons and other technologies let us know about your activity, including whether you received and opened our email, clicked through a link, or otherwise interacted with our content, and this information may be associated with Information previously collected.\n\nWe may also use cookies and other technologies (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our Sites, products, programs, and services and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our Sites and marketing materials, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, (v) to synchronize users across devices, affiliates, business partners, and select third parties, and (vi) for us and our affiliates, business partners, and select third parties to target, offer, market, or advertise products, programs, or services. Cookies and other technologies also facilitate, manage, and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us and/or other networks or sites. By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we send to you.\n\nManaging cookies and other technologies. Cookies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). Check your browser settings to learn how to delete cookies.\n\nYou may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Controlling cookies via browser controls may not limit our use of other technologies. Please consult your browser's settings for more information. However, blocking cookies or similar technology might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Site features.\n\nSome of our Sites may use locally stored objects (\"LSOs\") to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation, and a better user experience. Adobe's Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your web browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe's web site. Your browser may also offer other tools to delete or reject other LSOs; please check your browser's settings or help menu for more information.\n\nSome of our sites may use Google Analytics to analyze traffic. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage. To opt-out of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Sites, you can download and install the Browser Plugin available via this link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.\n\nWe do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.\n\nSee the Your Choices section to learn how to control data collection for certain purposes.\n\nInformation Security\n\nWe have put in place reasonable controls designed to help safeguard the personal information we collect via the Sites. However, no security measures are perfect and we cannot assure you that personal information that we collect will never be accessed or used in in an unauthorized way.\n\nHow You Can Access or Correct Information\n\nTo access the personal information that we have collected about you online from Sites on which this Privacy Policy is posted or to update your user profile, please log into your account if you have created one with us or send an email to privacy@hbomax.com.

However, in some cases if a user wants to participate in certain of our interactive features, we may ask the user to register and/or provide us with the user's age information and, in some cases, email address. If the person who registers indicates that he or she is under 13 years old, as permitted by law we will (i) collect no or limited personal information (e.g. email address only) from that individual, (ii) inform the child that a parent's verifiable consent is required, and/or (iii) collect the email address of the user's parent in addition to the user's email address. We use the parent's email address to seek the parent's verifiable consent or notify the parent of his/her child's online activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe his/her child from a newsletter or other similar activity. Once a parent provides consent, we may use any information from the child consistent with the rest of this Privacy Policy and/or the terms of the consent provided by the parent. If a user is under 13, we will not condition his/her participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. If you would like to review any personal information that we have collected online from your child, have this personal information deleted from our active servers, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child's personal information, or if you have questions about these information practices, you may contact us at privacy@hbomax.com, or at Warner Media, LLC, 30 Hudson Yards, New York NY 10001.\n\nInternational Transfer\n\nWe operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States, this means Information we collect will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you use or visit our Sites from outside the United States, you consent to the collection and/or processing in the United States of Information we collect from you.\n\nNotification Regarding Privacy Policy Updates\n\nFrom time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. We will notify you about changes to this Privacy Policy by placing a notice on our Sites.

We are committed to providing you control over your California Information. If you exercise any of these rights explained in this section of the Privacy Policy, we will not disadvantage you. You will not be denied or charged different prices or rates for goods or services or provided a different level or quality of goods or services.\n\nConsumers under 16 years old. CCPA has specific rules regarding the use of California Information from consumers under 16 years of age. In particular, consistent with the CCPA, if we knowingly collect the California Information of a consumer under the age of 16, we will not sell the information unless we receive affirmative permission to do so. If the consumer is between the ages of 13 and 16 years of age, the consumer may provide that permission; if the consumer is under the age of 13, the consumer's parent or guardian must provide the permission.\n\nIf you would like further information on how we handle California Information from consumers under the age of 16 years of age, or if you have questions about these information practices, you may contact us at wmprivacy@warnermediagroup.com, or at WarnerMedia Privacy Office, 4000 Warner Blvd., Bldg. 160, Burbank, CA 91522.\n\nHBO Max Children's Privacy Policy\n\nThis Children's Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices parents can make about information collected through Kid's Profiles within our HBO Max Platform. The word \"Platform\" in this Children's Privacy Policy has the meaning set forth in the Terms of Use.\n\nOther portions of our Platform are for adults. You should take a look at our General Audience Privacy Policy for more information about how we will collect and use data outside Kid's Profiles on the Platform. It is important to set up a Kid's Profile for your child under 18 because the information practices for these Kid's Profiles, which are described in this Children's Privacy Policy, are different than for adult profiles.\n\nWhat Information Do We Collect From Kid Profiles?\n\n\nInformation about child users:\nWhen you make a Kid's Profile, we will ask for some information about your child, like their first name and a profile photo (where available).  You can also exercise parental controls over your child's use of the profile, like the kinds of shows and movies they can watch and how to switch between the profiles on your HBO Max account.\n\nTechnical and usage information:\nWhen any user visits or uses our Platform, we will get some information about their device and their internet browser (for example, Safari, Chrome or Firefox). We will also get some information about their IP Address, device identifiers, and how they use our Platform. To learn more, see our section about Cookies.\n\nWhen users contact us:\nIf your child contacts us by email or using an online form, we will ask them for some information. For example, this may include their first name and email address and the reason they are contacting us. Once we have completed their request, we will delete their information.\n\nHow Do We Use Information?\n\nWe use the information we collect through a Kid's Profile for the purposes described in this Children's Privacy Policy or disclosed at the time of collection or with your consent, to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\nProviding and marketing products and services. We use the information we collect through a Kid's Profile within our Platform to provide the Platform; to analyze use of our Platform; and to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve the user experience and our offerings. For example, we use information collected from a Kid's Profile within our Platform to enable your child to watch trailers, movies, programs, and video clips and find others that may interest them within the Kid's Profile. We may also use the information we collect to show offers and advertisements based on what your child is watching.\n\nCommunicating with you and others. We use the information we collect to communicate with you or respond to your child's requests, such as (i) to notify you when you win one of our contests or sweepstakes or when we make changes to our policies or user agreements, (ii) to respond to your (and your child's) inquiries and customer support requests, (iii) to communicate with you about your purchases or transactions, or (iv) to contact you about your account (including your child's activity on the account), or (v) to send you information about promotions, offerings, and Platform features.\n\nUse of technical and usage information. We use technical and usage information to improve the design, functionality and content of our Platform and to enable us to personalize your child's experience with our Platform. We use this information (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our content and our Platform, products, and programs and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our Platform and content, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, and (iv) for us to show offers and advertisements based on what your child is watching.\n\nCompliance. We may use the information we collect to detect, investigate, and prevent activities on our Platform that may violate our terms of use, could be fraudulent, violate copyright, or other rules or that may be otherwise illegal, to comply with legal requirements, and to protect our rights and the rights and safety of our users and others.\n\nHow Do We Share Information?\n\nWhen permitted by law, we may share and disclose the information we collect from a Kid's Profile in the following ways or for any other purpose disclosed at the time of collection:\n\nWith your consent. We may disclose this information when you provide us with your consent to do so or, if permitted by law, when the child provides consent.\n\nLegal and law enforcement purposes. We may disclose information in response to legal process, for example in response to a court order or a subpoena, or in response to a law enforcement agency's request. We also may disclose such information to third parties: (i) in connection with fraud prevention activities, (ii) where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, (iii) in situations that may involve violations of our terms of use or other rules, (iv) to protect our rights and the rights and safety of others, and (v) as otherwise required by law.\n\nChange of control. We may transfer the information we collect in the event of a business transaction, such as if we or one of our business units or our relevant assets are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding or a business reorganization.\n\nService providers. Our agents and contractors may have access to information to help carry out the services they are performing for us, such as, but not limited to, creating, maintaining, hosting, and delivering the Platform and our products, and services; conducting marketing, handling payments, email and order fulfillment; administering contests; conducting research and analytics; or customer service.\n\nAffiliates. We may disclose information collected through a Kid's  Profile to affiliates in some cases, such as when the affiliates act like service providers performing services on our behalf. You can find a list of some of the affiliated WarnerMedia companies here. We may update this list from time-to-time, so please check back periodically to keep up-to-date.\n\nLinked sites. Some parts of our Platform contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different from ours. Information your child submits to other sites will be governed by the other sites' privacy policies and terms.\n\nCookies And Other Technologies\n\nCookies and other technologies. We, and our service providers, may send \"cookies\" or use similar technologies to understand and personalize your child's online experience in our Platform or for advertising within the Platform based on the content your child is watching.\n\nCookies are small text files placed in a browser. We may also use pixels or \"web beacons\" that monitor your child's use of our Platform for the purposes noted above. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a webpage for the purpose of transferring data. We may also integrate \"Software Development Kits\" (\"SDKs\") into our applications to perform similar functions as cookies and web beacons. For example, SDKs may collect technical and usage information such as mobile device identifiers and your interactions with the Platform.\n\nWe may also use cookies and other technologies (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our content and our Platform, products, and programs and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our Platform and content, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, and (v) for us to offer, market, or advertise products, programs, or services.\n\nManaging cookies and other technologies. Cookies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). Check your browser settings to learn how to delete cookies.\n\nYou may adjust a browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Controlling cookies via browser controls may not limit our use of other technologies. Please consult the browser's settings for more information.

We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.\n\nInternational Transfer\n\nWe operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States. This means the information we collect will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. The Platform is currently limited to accounts in the United States. However, if your child uses or visits our Platform from outside the United States, you consent to the collection and/or processing in the United States of information we collect from them.\n\nSecurity\n\nWe take reasonable steps to help safeguard the information we collect. However, no security measures are perfect, and we cannot assure you that personal information that we collect will never be accessed or used in in an unauthorized way.\n\nYour Rights\n\nYou can make certain requests regarding the personal information we collect from your child.  For instance, you may access this information, request that we delete it, and/or prohibit us from further collecting or using any information from your child. You or your adult can make these requests through our online portal here.\n\nYour California Rights\n\nCalifornia has passed a law named the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which grants California residents certain rights with respect to their personal information. The CCPA has specific rules regarding the use of children's information. In particular, the CCPA says that a parent or guardian must provide permission to sell personal information of users under the age of 13. It also allows you to ask for access to the information collected from a Kid's Profile or to ask us to delete it. Users aged 13-15 can provide permission or exercise these access and deletion rights directly. If you are interested in the rights that the CCPA grants to California residents, please visit the \"California and CCPA Privacy Rights and Disclosures\" section of the WarnerMedia Privacy Policy here.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you have any questions about this Children's Privacy Policy you may contact us at: WMPrivacy@warnermediagroup.com or write to us at the following address:\n\nWarnerMedia Privacy Office\nAttention: Chief Privacy Officer\n4000 Warner Blvd., Bldg. 160\nBurbank, CA 91522\nUnited States\n\n833- WM-PRVCY (833-967-7829) or 833-PRVCY-TT (833-778-2988)\nWMPrivacy@warnermediagroup.com\n\nUPDATES\n\nFrom time to time, we may update this Children's Privacy Policy.

This streaming service really delivers for the price as far as content goes. The overall selection of movies and shows contains more a list movies than any of the other services and it’s not filled with overflow of b movies most other services seem to offer. Of course the HBO original content is always top bar. Hard to complain about the quality of material on here. Overall the movies stream just fine on my roku and iPad, and I don’t have blazing fast top dollar internet either.\n\nSecond, the bad. Man this app feels real buggy. The app loads slow, changing between genres loads slow(like one of those webpages with way too many advertisements on it). Even accessing the basic navigation moves slow. Every click left, right up or down just takes a minute to register, and once it does it fires off how ever many times you click, so only click the arrow once, then just wait for it to catch up. Finally I do not even attempt to watch trailers anymore, as it always crashes my roku. I sure hope HBO is tackling these issues as it seems I am not the only one.\n\nAgain I will say, I have no issues when it comes to the steaming of movies and shows, which to me is the most important thing. But for a premium app that’s in the $13 a month ballpark I would expect a better overall product. Adding a scene selection feature to movies would be very nice too.","title":"Great catalogue , super buggy app tho","userName":"Al Fuego"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7451255890","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-06-11T06:24:44Z","developerResponse":{"id":23317724,"body":"Hi!

Clicking the far right or left of the remote’s touchpad no longer skips forward/back, tapping no longer brings up the time bar, and swiping on the touchpad scrubs without the need for pausing and at a speed that makes it nearly impossible to move to an accurate time (it seems that now the width of the touch pad relates to the entire time bar so that, starting from the beginning of an episode, one swipe from left to right will take you to the end of the episode/movie). The last point causes problems because you need to swipe on the touch pad to bring up the time bar, and I’ve accidentally skipped most of the way through what I’m watching when only trying to see how much is left. This along with the removal of support for 15s skips (which is standard for any streaming service) makes it very difficult to move forward or back a short amount of time. Additionally, the Play Next Episode function is somewhat broken on both Apple TV and iOS. On Apple TV it isn’t possible to swipe to the button, and attempting to click on it seems to both pause whatever’s playing and move to the next episode, almost as if the two fields were selected at this same time. This makes it impossible to pause at the end of an episode once Next Episode has appeared, and equally impossible to move away from the next episode button.","title":"Edit: Issue Resolved - Apple TV Version Broken","userName":"Bertie'sBurgerBarn"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7790423426","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-09-10T08:55:35Z","developerResponse":{"id":25077291,"body":"Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

First the buffering could be improved greatly especially at the first 5, 8, 15 or so minutes and around 37th- 45th minutes.  If you watch series like DC Titans or others- the  app hangs when switching to next episode - this happens quite often - app continually becomes unresponsive and has to be exited. I played around with security or screen lock to see if this affects but have yet definite conclusion as to the cause! Also each episode starts with the Audio description enabled. EACH time a new episode starts it resets the audio description to on!  The only way I have found to turn it off is to toggle audio description on then to English or Spanish then back off.  Gets old doing this each time. Also happens with some of the newer movies too.  Regression test app with older Apple TV’s as it does this on earlier Gen Apple TV’s too. Does it on my older model A1469!  In short refine and streamline the apps airplay abilities for a more enjoyable seamless streaming experience.

Despite current update,  issues described below have not resolved. \n\nThe plus is that the content is pretty decent with new items being added weekly. The downside is that the app is so buggy you can’t stream anything! Slow to start, significant delays when navigating the Home Screen, slow to load lists…this app is beyond frustrating! Don’t even try to toggle between the different app features or fast forward/rewind a show or movie (if you’re lucky enough to get one to actually load). The app frequently crashes when trying to search or stream any content. I’ve been trying to stream content for several days now and the app crashes before the movie loads EVERY TIME!! I get so fed up that I end up moving on to a different streaming service. HBO announced an update 6 days ago that was supposed to resolve these issues but I have the most current version downloaded and still dealing with the same glitches.

Not only is it slower than MOLASSES on my tv, but on my iPad, it will just continue to rewind/fast forward unless you touch another part of the screen. You should be able to double tap the screen and ff/r. How isn’t that an option? The other day, I tried casting from my iPad to my tv and the audio would only play every other half second. Like what???? Also, why does my brand new tv not have an hbo max app, but my tv that is 4 YEARS older have it?

I love the overall content, but since the new HBO Max app has rolled out, it has been one of my worst streaming experiences ever.  I am a subscriber to multiple media streaming services and none of them do what HBO Max does.  I use Chromecast to stream and after about 15 minutes into a movie or show I’ll get the “circle of death” as I like to call it.  The app is trying to buffer, but instead of doing it once or twice, it continues to buffer for about every five minutes after that until the movie or show is complete.  At first I just thought maybe it was my Internet or Chromecast but it’s been doing this for weeks now. It is definitely a fault or bug within the app and it is by far one of the most frustrating things to experience as a customer. Every time an update comes out for the app, my phone automatically pushes the update through and the non-stop buffering still continues to happen.  I have no idea what to do but I know for a fact, if it continues to keep happening, I’m going to no longer be an HBO subscriber because it’s just not worth the frustration. With all the technology experts out there and all the money/resources that Warner has, I’m really surprised that this bug has not been resolved.  I’ve read through other app reviews and it seems like I’m not the only person that’s experiencing this.

The content is awesome.  It’s a big catalog with a wide range of selections.  That is why I’m giving it 2 stars instead of 1.  \n\nThe App is SUPER glitchy, buggy, inconsistent, etc.  In my experience, no other streaming app takes this long to load.  It’s not even close.  Once it’s open and you select something be ready to not touch anything.  Not sure what the developers were going for here, but if it was to create the movie theatre experience then maybe they aren’t as far off as I thought.  If you want to pause it to use the bathroom or get snacks, want to scrub it back to replay something you missed, or stop the movie to watch something else, be prepared to spend extra time.  The app rarely, if ever, responds to the first touch of anything and if you try to press it again, it will either buffer or get stuck.  I have read some of your responses, so before you respond and tell me it’s my router or internet connection, I’ve checked it and it’s working just fine.  But I don’t want to complain too much since a ton of others have already said what I’m feeling.\n\nI will go back to the positives and that I am able to watch content on here that me and my family enjoy.  If it was a free service I would be leaving 5 stars and a big thank you.  But until that happens this is the best I can do.","title":"Different User, Same Experience","userName":"crashing inn"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7532748808","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-07-03T01:25:53Z","rating":1,"review":"We’ve used HBO Max for quite some time now with no issues. Seamless just like any other app and never had any complaints....until recently. One day we found ourselves unable to access any movies or shows on our TV with a prompt to “access HBO Max” but the button wasn’t clickable. Just completely unresponsive. After about an hour and a half of trying to troubleshoot(router reset, app reinstall, app update, signing into the mobile app, etc..) and going in circles with a useless customer service, we canceled the account under my girlfriends information and created a new one under mine. For some reason, this worked. Got charged twice in one month with this solution, but we were back in action. Here we are two weeks later and the app is so glitchy we literally cannot get through 20 minutes of a movie or show. It’ll randomly start looping a 10 second clip and all the controls stop working. Resetting the TV resets the app and it’s the only way to revert back. This was happening before when navigating the menu which was also super frustrating; but now I’m literally paying for a service that is unusable. Netflix and other steaming services work fine, but for some reason HBO can’t figure it out. Absolutely terrible service. They should fix these bugs and give their subscribers a month or two free of charge for the trouble, as I’m not the only one experiencing these issues.","title":"Glitchy to the point of being useless","userName":"MitAshRay"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7301497996","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-05-05T15:56:25Z","rating":2,"review":"Everyone loves HBO’s content. There’s no debating this. What I can’t figure out is why, for such a premier service, the app (for iPhone specifically) is so terribly infuriating. My single main complaint is a big one, because it affects my experience almost every time I watch something. THE FAST FORWARD/REWIND BAR FUNCTIONS ARE THE VERY WORST OF ITS KIND. On literally every other streaming service out there(even the most obscure ones), if you tap the screen to bring up the playback options, the time bar can be used to seamlessly drag to wherever you want to continue watching from.  It’s likely one of the very most commonly used features of any streaming app.  On the HBO Max app, if you aren’t able to sit and watch every movie/show/episode uninterrupted from start to finish, forget about it.  Attempting to move back/forward to any point in the show creates enough frustration that I’m convinced it has led to many broken phones. This MUST be fixed.  And SOON. Based on the research I’ve done on this issue, many others are displeased with these functionalities(and others) of your apps. PLEASE get this issue resolved ASAP so I can get back to actually enjoying my experience while using one of my very favorite streaming services. I’ve just about reached my limit on how long I can deal with it. This is my final plea. HELP!","title":"Love HBO, HATE the app","userName":"AlwaysChilly"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6874075804","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-01-15T21:15:49Z","rating":2,"review":"I love HBO’s content, and I was very excited when it was announced that the app would allow downloads for offline viewing. However, I was very disappointed to discover that while you can download videos, if you try to watch them in airplane mode (say when, I don’t know, flying on an airplane), the app will let you watch for a while then suddenly freak out and become trapped in an endless loop of error messages as it repeatedly tries and fails to contact the server. This problem has been present for months and it appears no effort has been made to fix it.\n\nAdditionally, the app does not keep accurate track of how many videos you currently have downloaded. There is a global limit for the account of 30 downloaded videos, and if you want to download beyond that you are prompted to delete unwanted videos to stay below the limit. However, when you delete a few videos, the app continues to give you the same error message saying you can’t download more than 30 videos, and does not permit you to download.\n\nThe content on HBO is really great, but I primarily only have time to consume it on flights. It is frustrating beyond belief that this app gets so close to the desired feature a d then totally falls flat on its face in the execution.","title":"Download function is broken and has been for
