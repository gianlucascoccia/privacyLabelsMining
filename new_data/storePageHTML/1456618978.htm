        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have had BET+ for a week now. I love first wives club and bigger. I wish they had more categories that made sense instead of it just saying “more black content.” It’s hard to find what your looking for. There is a show I was looking forward to watching that is on the app that can’t be played due to rights restrictions. So that can be a bit frustrating. I am looking for a bit more customization on the app meaning; being able to have separate user names and being able to create a watch later list. Ideally for 9.99 a month i would hope their would be content on there for the whole family like; Moesha, the pj’s, Johnson family vacation. I know these aren’t created by BET but perhaps having some family friendly originals. I also notice that the shows that are currently on BET aren’t featured on BET+ like sista’s or hit the floor.<br /><br />Other than those suggestions. I am enjoying the content and looking forward to more shows and movies. I can’t wait to rewatch all of the Tyler Perry plays.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’m really trying to give this app a chance, but from these first couple of weeks that I’ve had it all I can say is that it’s incredibly GLITCHY! It freezes CONSTANTLY while you’re watching a show, and on some episodes, you’ll be lucky to get through one scene without the app freezing! You’ll be playing the guessing game on a lot of the scenes because at times all you can hear is the audio, yet no movement of the screen because it’s frozen. Also annoying that there’s no “Continue Watching” feature on this app (similar to Netflix), so if you decide you want to finish the rest of the show/movie you’re watching at a later time, you have to go look for it. <br /><br />BET is already on the decline as a network, so if this app is supposed to revive it, then it’ll need to be MUCH better than this. Because I’m not gonna continue to pay $10 a month for a glitchy app with mostly reruns and old movies on it, especially not when many of the original shows that are supposed to be exclusive to the BET+ app eventually end up being broadcast on regular BET anyway. These aren’t the old days when BET was the only game in town for Black audiences. There are A LOT of other apps catering to the Black demographic that has better value (some even free). With all that said, I’ll give BET Networks a month or two to clean up their act before I completely say DUECES✌🏿 to this app.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve had bet for almost a year now and pay monthly for the app. I got it on my fire cube well I only got the because of my favorite show RUTHLESS by Tyler perry yes I pay this much money to watch one tv show that’s how much I love it I also watch the oval on my Directv and thank god it comes on that are I wouldn’t be able to watch it probably either. Anyways to get to the matter. I been trying to watch season episode 5 of ruthless well going on a month now I can’t watch it buffers there’s a circle in middle of my screen that spins around and around and no it’s not my internet and it’s not my fire cube because I’ve done everything possible tech wise I’ve rebooted my fire cube my internet and even my my wifi on my iPhone and my iPhone still want play and I’m able to watch any other show on both my BET t apps just fine. And it’s starting to really aggravate me like I’m bout to just stop my subscription all together because I noticed that it actually will come on regular bet I just got to wait so why should I pay for a app that I got to watch one show and it not play. And yes everything is updated fine so nope that’s not the problem either and also I’ve deleted and reinstalled the app on my fire cube and iPhone so it’s on bet pluses end and if it don’t start working by Monday I’m stopping my subscription and waiting to watch on my Directv regular bet</p>

What Information Is Collected. \nWhen we use the term \"Personal Information\" we mean information that you provide us that identifies you or would allow someone to contact you, such as your full name, postal address, email address or telephone number. When we use the term \"Other Information\", we mean any information other than Personal Information that may be collected about you, including, but not limited to, Device and advertising identifiers and information collected through cookies or other Tracking Technologies or Identifiers (as those terms are defined below). Any Personal Information that is modified to remove your contact information and other information that identifies you or that is replaced with information that no longer identifies you or allows someone to contact you (for example, hashed email addresses or usernames) shall not be treated as Personal Information but shall be treated as Other Information after such modification. (Personal Information and Other Information shall be referred to, together, as \"Information\".)\n\n3.1 Information We Collect that You Provide Us.\n\n3.1.1 User Registration; Third Party Social Media Network Sign-On; Single VII Sign-On. If we offer user registration on the Site, to register as a member of the Site, there may be a few options for you to register: Site Registration (as described below), Third Party Social Media Network Sign-On (as described below) and, if you have previously registered on another VII website, application or other interactive service using one of those methods, Single VII Sign-On (as defined and described below) if offered by this Site. In each case, you are required to either use a pre-existing user name and password (together, your \"User ID\") or select a new User ID. \n\n3.1.1.1 Site Registration. For Site registration, you are required to select a User ID and may be required to also provide other Information, such as your email address and date of birth. Additional Information may be requested and/or required during the registration process. After you have registered for the Site under Site Registration, we may recognize you when you visit certain other VII websites, applications or other interactive services across Devices (such as when you login) and permit you to use Single VII Sign-On (as described below) to register for and login on such other websites, applications or other interactive services, but please note that other VII websites, applications or other interactive services may set additional or different requirements for membership, such as minimum age. \n\n3.1.1.2 Third Party Social Media Network Sign-On. We may provide you with the ability to sign on to the Site by using third party social media network credentials (\"SMN\"). If you choose to sign-in through an SMN, you may be required to provide us with all or some of the Information required in the Site's registration form and your use of the Site shall be governed by the applicable SMN's privacy policy and user agreements as well as this Privacy Policy and the Site's Terms of Use Agreement at http://www.cc.com/legal/terms-of-use. Please note that the SMN may set additional or different requirements for membership than those set for the Site, such as minimum age. We, and VII, are not responsible for the use of any such SMN, or for the accuracy, use or misuse of any information that you may disclose to or receive from an SMN or other third party in connection with such use. If you use an SMN to sign-in, we may receive certain information from such SMN and our use of your Information we receive from any SMN is governed by the relevant policies of any such SMN and any permissions you give us regarding your Information, including, but not limited to, those set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions about whether a particular feature, function or service of the Site is powered by a third party, you may contact us with your question as provided in Section 12.2 (Questions) below. \n\nAfter you have registered for the Site through SMN, we may recognize you when you visit certain other VII websites, applications or other interactive services and permit you to use Single VII Sign-On (as described below) to register for and login on such other websites, applications or other interactive services. \n\n3.1.1.3 Single VII Sign-On. If you are not already registered for the Site, but are registered on other VII websites, applications or other interactive services through any of the above methods, we may permit you to use your User ID from such other VII websites, applications or other interactive services to register for and log into this Site (\"Single VII Sign-On\"), but please note that this Site may set additional or different requirements for membership, such as minimum age, than those requirements set by other VII websites, applications or other interactive services. \n\nAlso note that, for your online privacy and security, if other people have access to your Device, we recommend you log out of your account after visiting any of the websites, applications or other interactive services that are associated with your account. \n\n3.1.2 In Connection with Certain Features and Functions.

To sign up for or participate in these features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions. For example, if we offer e-Commerce services on this Site, if you order any of our goods or services through such services, in addition to your name and contact information, we (or our operational service providers that we use to provide the e-Commerce service) may also collect and/or maintain your billing address, shipping address, selections, credit card or other payment instrument information, order number and information about your computer's internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (e.g., the referring URL). \n\nThe Site may also provide features, functions and/or services powered by an SMN or other third party. For example, Information may be disclosed to an SMN through plug-ins offered by such SMN (such as Likes, Shares or commenting). Please take care when using any SMN or other third party service and familiarize yourself with the SMN's or other third party's policies and agreements, if any, that govern such use.\n\n3.1.3 In Connection with Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.

Additional Information may be requested depending on the specific Promotion. The Promotion's entry page and/or Rules shall provide the specific requirements. You may also have the opportunity to opt-in to receive special Promotions or offers from our third party advertisers, sponsors or promotional partners (\"Advertisers\") as a result of your use of the Site in connection with these Promotions. \n\n3.2 Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. \n\nThe Site and/or third parties may use \"cookies\", \"web beacons\", Flash local shared objects and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, \"Tracking Technologies\") to collect Other Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web. \"Cookies\" are typically html or browser-based text or other files (and often referred to as browser cookies) that help store information, user preferences and/or user activity. \"Web beacons\" (also known as image tags, gif, tracking pixels or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. Flash local shared objects (\"LSOs\") (sometimes known as Flash cookies and used if Adobe Flash is used) are text or other files that help store user preferences and/or activity. \n\nThese Tracking Technologies collect \"click stream\" data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site's webpages, type of browser use, type of operating system used, date and time of viewing, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences) or other websites, applications or interactive services. Through these Tracking Technologies, we may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other websites, applications or other interactive services and may also collect or access your IP address (which is automatically assigned to any Device(s) and/or Device and Internet browser combination you use to access the Site) and/or set or access some other identifier unique to the Device(s), Device platform and/or Device-Internet browser combination you use to access the Site (\"Identifier\"). For example, we may set a unique alphanumeric Identifier unique to your home computer on Firefox, or access an Identifier provided by a mobile platform, such as the application or advertising Identifiers offered by Apple. Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may combine any or all of the Other Information we collect using Tracking Technologies and associate it and/or Identifiers with your Personal Information (such as your Single VII Sign-On ID) and/or with other non-personally identifiable unique identifiers assigned by VII or third parties. \n\n3.2.1 The Site's Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information. \nBy visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge and understand that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site and other websites, applications or interactive services through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you. See Your Choices section below for more information on how you can withdraw your consent for certain purposes. \n\nWe use Tracking Technologies to enable us to collect and then use Information as described in Section 4.2 \"Other Information Collected by Us\" under \"How Is Collected Information Used\" below. For example, we use Tracking Technologies to enable Single VII Sign-On, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times or seeing advertisements too frequently, to tailor your experience on the Site by delivering relevant personalized advertising, email marketing and other content and to record if you have opted out of receiving personalized advertising from us. \n\n3.2.2 Third Parties' Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information. \nThis Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or audience measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, \"Third Party Service Providers\") to, for example, facilitate personalized advertisements (\"Customized Advertising\") and/or other content, serve advertisements on the Site and/or measure and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site. Customized Advertising enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you for products and services that you might be interested in based on your visits to the Site and other websites, applications or other interactive services you have visited. \n\nThird Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device subject to your choices about those Tracking Technologies (see \"Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers\" section below and \"More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies\" section below) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Site. \n\nWe may also enlist the assistance of Third Party Service Providers so that the Site may set Tracking Technologies. For example, to the extent necessary to provide basic advertising serving services such as controlling how often you see advertisements or ensuring you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, we may enlist the assistance of such Third Party Service Providers to create, customize or modify Tracking Technologies set by the Site. See also Section 5.2.1 for more information on this Site's use of Nielsen's proprietary measurement software to collect and use video viewing metrics and other information. \n\nExcept to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site, but we may provide to Third Party Service Providers certain Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Site in order for the Site to provide Customized Advertising or in order for the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to the Site, such as measuring or analyzing advertising or content effectiveness or traffic on the Site. For example, in order to analyze traffic on the Site, we may provide to our Third Party Service Providers certain information we collect about your interaction with the Site along with an Identifier so that the Third Party Service Provider may provide analytics services to the Site. \n\n4.

The use of Tracking Technologies by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers is within their control and not ours. Even if we have a relationship with the Third Party Service Provider or Advertiser, we do not control their websites, applications or other interactive services or their policies and practices regarding your Information and you should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your Information by third parties in connection with their advertisements or promotions and other sites, applications or other interactive services you encounter on the Internet. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Information that a Third Party Service Provider or Advertiser may directly collect from you. Use of Third Party Service Providers' and Advertisers' Tracking Technologies is governed by the Third Party Service Providers' or Advertisers', as applicable, own specific privacy policies and not this Privacy Policy. However, please see the \"Your Choices\" section for more information on how to opt-out of the collection and/or use of Information collected by certain Third Party Service Providers. \n\n5.Your Choices.\n\n5.1 Opting-Out of Certain Uses of Personal Information.\n\n5.1.1 In Connection with Marketing and Promotional Emails and Offers. \nYou may \"opt-out\" of receiving marketing and promotional emails from us at any time by using the opt-out mechanism that is contained in each such email.

Please note that using those controls may affect Tracking Technologies which are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.\n\n* See the \"More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies\" section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by the Site and for information on your choices regarding Identifiers on mobile platforms.\n\nThis Site is committed to complying with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Click our Ad Choices link at http://srp.viacom.com/sitefaq.html for more information about this Site and Customized Advertising. \n\nPlease note that if you exercise the Ad Choices opt-out above, that only applies to the use of the data for Customized Advertising and we may still use the data for other purposes described in Section 4.2 \"How is Collected Information Used\" above, such as for video playhead tracking and to optimize your video experience. \n\n5.2.3 More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies. With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, please note the following with respect to the above opt-out options: \n\n* Your Choices Regarding the Site's Use of Information for Customized Advertising. You can prevent the Site's use of Information collected through Tracking Technologies for Customized Advertising by exercising the opt-outs offered by Third Party Service Providers we use as described in our Ad Choices link at http://srp.viacom.com/sitefaq.html. Some of your options available in our AdChoices link may opt you out of receiving Customized Advertising across Devices. \n\n* More Information About Cookie Controls. \n\nFor the following Internet browsers, you may prevent or exercise choices regarding browser cookies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls described in the following: \n\nInternet Explorer 11 at http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/delete-manage-cookies#ie=ie-11\n\nChrome at https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en\n\nSafari at http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/cookies/\n\nFirefox at https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer\n\nIf your Internet browser is not listed above or you otherwise are having difficulties with the links, you may be able to access controls to: \n\no Delete existing browser cookies through the \"Internet Options\", \"Settings\", Preferences\", \"Options\" or similar menu selection in your browser's menu or otherwise as directed by your browser's support feature, which means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in the future.\n\no Disable browser cookies through the same browser controls which means that browser cookies shall not be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted. Additional information on enabling or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser's support feature. (See the \"help\" section of your browser for more information.) Disabling may sometimes be referred to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices. If you delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.\n\no Choose to have the Device you use to access the Site warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set. (You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.) This may be available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Site. Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser's support feature.\n\no Seek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser's support features.\n\nThe above options may cover browser cookies set by the Site, browser cookies not set by the Site (sometimes called third party cookies) and/or both types of browser cookies. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATION OF THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS. ALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS ARE DIFFERENT FROM DO NOT TRACK OPTIONS THAT MAY ALSO BE OFFERED BY CERTAIN BROWSERS. \n\n* Many tools discussed above are \"Internet browser cookie based\". This means that such tools rely on cookies to remember your choices. For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to re-establish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms described in our Ad Choices link, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through these mechanisms again.\n\n* The tools are \"Internet browser and Device-specific\" or \"Device-specific\". Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices. This means, for example, that if you block or disable browser cookies for Internet Explorer 9 on one Device, this choice shall not block or disable browser cookies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device or on a different Device using Internet Explorer 9. Further, you may need to separately exercise your options for other platforms, such as mobile platform (as described below). See our Ad Choices link at http://srp.viacom.com/sitefaq.htmlfor more information about this Site and other options you may have regarding Customized Advertising across Devices.\n\n* Automatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs. Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function. For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.\n\n* You shall still receive advertisements. Deleting or disabling Third Party Service Providers', Advertisers' or the Site's Tracking Technologies does not mean that you shall no longer receive online ads. If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you shall continue to see ads on this Site and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Site to set Tracking Technologies for frequency capping purposes as described in the \"Information Collected Through the Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies\" section.\n\n* Limitations Regarding Web Beacons. Web beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled Tracking Technologies to track your activities. \n\n* How to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies). Control of Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies) Must Be Handled Separately. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER. Deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Site through the above options shall not remove Flash LSOs. For more information about Flash LSOs and how to remove them from your computer, please visit http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html. If you remove Flash LSOs, you may not have access to certain features of the Site and some of our other services may not function properly.\n\n* Other Effects of Managing Tracking Technologies. In addition to the above, if you delete or disable Tracking Technologies set by the Site, the Site may no longer be able to offer certain features or functionality to you, such as remembering your preferences, remembering your username, enabling Single VII Sign-On, saving your player settings or other purposes described in \"Other Information Collected By Us\" above, and some of our other services may not function properly. In addition to the above, if you disable or delete Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers (or if such Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled on your Device or browser), the Site may no longer be able to offer certain functionality to you, such as enabling SMN login or saving your player settings and certain services or advertisements may not work for such Devices or browsers.\n\n* Mobile Platforms. Certain mobile platforms, such as Apple or Google, may offer users choice regarding the Identifiers we, Third Party Service Providers or Advertisers may access and use, which may not be browser cookie based. We encourage you to review and understand the choices that such mobile platforms may provide to you regarding these Identifiers.\n\n* Certain Identifiers. Certain Identifiers we set may not be deleted, blocked or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such Identifiers rely on, or are associated with, browser cookies or other Tracking Technologies. \n\n* Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit \"do-not-track\" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. \n\nWe currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals. Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for Customized Advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in this Section 5.2.3 and in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.\n\n6.

If we do so, we will require your prior express consent for any Text Services in accordance with the nature of the Text Service and applicable laws, rules and regulations. \n\nWhen you register for the Channel's Text Services, you acknowledge, understand and agree that you may be charged by your wireless carrier for the ability to send or receive all such messages. The standard messaging rates of your wireless carrier shall apply to all Text Services, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances shall the Channel or VII be responsible for any wireless service charges incurred by you or by a person that has access to your wireless device, telephone number, or email address. If you change or deactivate your wireless telephone number, you agree to notify us when your wireless telephone number is no longer associated with you and identify such wireless phone number to ensure that future messages directed to you are not sent to the person to whom your old number has been or will be assigned.\n\nWe may share your Personal Information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering Text Services and similar services to you, with VII and as otherwise provided in \"Sharing and Disclosure of Information\" below. \n\nPlease note that you may always send a text message that says \"HELP\" to receive help on text messaging.\n\n7.

In addition to disclosing certain Information to VII in connection with Single VII Sign-On, we may disclose Personal Information to VII for marketing, administrative and/or other purposes. You can choose to opt-out of certain such uses as described in the \"Opting-Out of Certain Uses of Personal Information\" Section above. \n\n7.1.2 Disclosure of Certain Information in Postings Intended to Be Disclosed. Certain Personal Information associated with a Posting may be intended for disclosure (\"Posting Information\"), such as username. We shall disclose Posting Information in connection with the display of, and other services relating to, such Posting. \n\n7.1.3 Disclosure In Connection with Co-Branded Services and Features. The Site may also offer services and features, such as events and Promotions, that we put together with another company (\"Co-Branded Partner\") and that may be hosted on the Site and/or our Co-Branded Partner's or a Promotion-specific website, application or other interactive service.

Please note that your Information may be shared with Co-Branded Partners for purposes of administering or conducting the co-branded services and features (but not for marketing purposes) without a separate opt in (for example, if the Co-Branded Partner is administering a Promotion you have entered, your Information may be shared with the Co-Branded Partner so that the Co-Branded Partner can verify your eligibility and/or contact you if you are a potential winner). \n\n7.1.4 Disclosure to Operational Service Providers. We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Site's services, features, functions and operations. We shall refer to these third parties as \"operational service providers\". We use operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services, features and functions we bring you and we disclose your Personal Information to operational service providers for the purpose of providing services to us. \n\n7.1.5 Disclosure to Certain Other Third Parties. In addition to the above, we make your Personal Information available to certain third parties in the following limited circumstances: \n\n* When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process) or if requested by a governmental agency or other authority as part of an investigation; \n\n* If we believe your actions violate any law, rule, regulation and/or the Terms of Use Agreement at http://www.cc.com/legal/terms-of-use, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy or Additional Terms; \n\n* In connection with Promotions, as necessary to administer the Promotion or as required by applicable laws, rules or regulations (for example, to provide winners' lists or make required filings as appropriate);\n\n* If you agree to have your Personal Information shared with or otherwise disclosed to a third party for marketing or other purposes, in which case the third party's use of your Personal Information is subject to the third party's own privacy policy;\n\n* If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate: to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries; to protect our business and assets or the rights, property or safety of the Channel, VII, or any of its or their operational service providers, licensors, suppliers, Advertisers, customers, users, or any other party; to limit our legal liability; to defend our interests; to enforce this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use Agreement and/or to comply with our legal, regulatory, audit and compliance obligations or requests by law enforcement or other governmental authorities and/or \n\n* In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, sale, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us, or VII. \n\n7.2 Sharing and Disclosure of Other Information.

In such cases, we shall provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries. \n\n8.5 Children or Ineligible Teenagers. If we, or VII, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of the Site or certain features of this Site (\"Ineligible Teenagers\"), the child or Ineligible Teenager, or parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager (the \"Parent\"), may unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a Parent of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state). In addition, Parents who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must either (i) use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the \"Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use\" Section of the Terms of Use Agreement at http://www.cc.com/legal/terms-of-use to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership or (ii) send an email to privacy@viacom.com (or, if available, contact us by using the Site's ContactUs tool) and provide us with your child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the URL of the Site and request to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration or (iii), if a Parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, send an email to privacy@viacom.com (or, if available, contact us by using the Site's ContactUs tool) that includes the Parent's name, address, telephone and email address, the child's or Ineligible Teenager's name and/or email address as registered on the Site, and the URL of the Site. If a Parent sends an email under subsections (ii) or (iii), the Site may send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration and may provide or request additional information (for example, requesting that the Parent provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager) before terminating the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and, upon or prior to termination, may notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request. \n\n9. Protection of Information.\n\nWhile the Internet and data transmission over the Internet is not 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information.

We request that our operational service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality. \n\nPhishing. Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account credentials. \"Phishers\" use 'spoofed' emails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites, or otherwise respond in a manner that is, designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers. WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD! If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site's Privacy Administrator at privacy@viacom.com, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer. \n\n10.

Flash local shared objects (\"LSOs\") (sometimes known as Flash cookies and used if Adobe Flash is used) are text or other files that help store user preferences and/or activity. \n\nThese Tracking Technologies collect \"click stream\" data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site's webpages, type of browser use, type of operating system used, date and time of viewing, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences) or other websites, applications or interactive services. Through these Tracking Technologies, we may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other websites, applications or other interactive services and may also collect or access your IP address (which is automatically assigned to any Device(s) and/or Device and Internet browser combination you use to access the Site) and/or set or access some other identifier unique to the Device(s), Device platform and/or Device-Internet browser combination you use to access the Site (\"Identifier\"). For example, we may set a unique alphanumeric Identifier unique to your home computer on Firefox, or access an Identifier provided by a mobile platform, such as the application or advertising Identifiers offered by Apple. Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may combine any or all of the Other Information we collect using Tracking Technologies and associate it and/or Identifiers with your Personal Information (such as your Single VII Sign-On ID) and/or with other non-personally identifiable unique identifiers assigned by VII or third parties. \n\n3.2.1 The Site's Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information. \nBy visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge and understand that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site and other websites, applications or interactive services through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you. See Your Choices section below for more information on how you can withdraw your consent for certain purposes. \n\nWe use Tracking Technologies to enable us to collect and then use Information as described in Section 4.2 \"Other Information Collected by Us\" under \"How Is Collected Information Used\" below. For example, we use Tracking Technologies to enable Single VII Sign-On, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times or seeing advertisements too frequently, to tailor your experience on the Site by delivering relevant personalized advertising, email marketing and other content and to record if you have opted out of receiving personalized advertising from us. \n\n3.2.2 Third Parties' Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information. \nThis Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or audience measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, \"Third Party Service Providers\") to, for example, facilitate personalized advertisements (\"Customized Advertising\") and/or other content, serve advertisements on the Site and/or measure and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site. Customized Advertising enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you for products and services that you might be interested in based on your visits to the Site and other websites, applications or other interactive services you have visited. \n\nThird Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device subject to your choices about those Tracking Technologies (see \"Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers\" section below and \"More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies\" section below) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Site. \n\nWe may also enlist the assistance of Third Party Service Providers so that the Site may set Tracking Technologies. For example, to the extent necessary to provide basic advertising serving services such as controlling how often you see advertisements or ensuring you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, we may enlist the assistance of such Third Party Service Providers to create, customize or modify Tracking Technologies set by the Site. See also Section 5.2.1 for more information on this Site's use of Nielsen's proprietary measurement software to collect and use video viewing metrics and other information. \n\nExcept to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site, but we may provide to Third Party Service Providers certain Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Site in order for the Site to provide Customized Advertising or in order for the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to the Site, such as measuring or analyzing advertising or content effectiveness or traffic on the Site. For example, in order to analyze traffic on the Site, we may provide to our Third Party Service Providers certain information we collect about your interaction with the Site along with an Identifier so that the Third Party Service Provider may provide analytics services to the Site. \n\n4.

The use of Tracking Technologies by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers is within their control and not ours. Even if we have a relationship with the Third Party Service Provider or Advertiser, we do not control their websites, applications or other interactive services or their policies and practices regarding your Information and you should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your Information by third parties in connection with their advertisements or promotions and other sites, applications or other interactive services you encounter on the Internet. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Information that a Third Party Service Provider or Advertiser may directly collect from you. Use of Third Party Service Providers' and Advertisers' Tracking Technologies is governed by the Third Party Service Providers' or Advertisers', as applicable, own specific privacy policies and not this Privacy Policy. However, please see the \"Your Choices\" section for more information on how to opt-out of the collection and/or use of Information collected by certain Third Party Service Providers. \n\n5.Your Choices.\n\n5.1 Opting-Out of Certain Uses of Personal Information.\n\n5.1.1 In Connection with Marketing and Promotional Emails and Offers. \nYou may \"opt-out\" of receiving marketing and promotional emails from us at any time by using the opt-out mechanism that is contained in each such email.

With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, you have a number of options: \n\n* You can prevent or exercise choices regarding the use of certain Tracking Technologies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls in your Internet browser as described in \"More Information About Cookie Controls\" section below. Please note that using those controls may affect Tracking Technologies which are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.\n\n* See the \"More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies\" section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by the Site and for information on your choices regarding Identifiers on mobile platforms.\n\nThis Site is committed to complying with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Click our Ad Choices link at http://srp.viacom.com/sitefaq.html for more information about this Site and Customized Advertising. \n\nPlease note that if you exercise the Ad Choices opt-out above, that only applies to the use of the data for Customized Advertising and we may still use the data for other purposes described in Section 4.2 \"How is Collected Information Used\" above, such as for video playhead tracking and to optimize your video experience. \n\n5.2.3 More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies. With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, please note the following with respect to the above opt-out options: \n\n* Your Choices Regarding the Site's Use of Information for Customized Advertising. You can prevent the Site's use of Information collected through Tracking Technologies for Customized Advertising by exercising the opt-outs offered by Third Party Service Providers we use as described in our Ad Choices link at http://srp.viacom.com/sitefaq.html. Some of your options available in our AdChoices link may opt you out of receiving Customized Advertising across Devices. \n\n* More Information About Cookie Controls. \n\nFor the following Internet browsers, you may prevent or exercise choices regarding browser cookies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls described in the following: \n\nInternet Explorer 11 at http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/delete-manage-cookies#ie=ie-11\n\nChrome at https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en\n\nSafari at http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/cookies/\n\nFirefox at https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer\n\nIf your Internet browser is not listed above or you otherwise are having difficulties with the links, you may be able to access controls to: \n\no Delete existing browser cookies through the \"Internet Options\", \"Settings\", Preferences\", \"Options\" or similar menu selection in your browser's menu or otherwise as directed by your browser's support feature, which means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in the future.\n\no Disable browser cookies through the same browser controls which means that browser cookies shall not be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted. Additional information on enabling or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser's support feature. (See the \"help\" section of your browser for more information.) Disabling may sometimes be referred to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices. If you delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.\n\no Choose to have the Device you use to access the Site warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set. (You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.) This may be available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Site. Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser's support feature.\n\no Seek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser's support features.\n\nThe above options may cover browser cookies set by the Site, browser cookies not set by the Site (sometimes called third party cookies) and/or both types of browser cookies. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATION OF THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS. ALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS ARE DIFFERENT FROM DO NOT TRACK OPTIONS THAT MAY ALSO BE OFFERED BY CERTAIN BROWSERS. \n\n* Many tools discussed above are \"Internet browser cookie based\". This means that such tools rely on cookies to remember your choices. For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to re-establish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms described in our Ad Choices link, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through these mechanisms again.\n\n* The tools are \"Internet browser and Device-specific\" or \"Device-specific\". Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices. This means, for example, that if you block or disable browser cookies for Internet Explorer 9 on one Device, this choice shall not block or disable browser cookies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device or on a different Device using Internet Explorer 9. Further, you may need to separately exercise your options for other platforms, such as mobile platform (as described below). See our Ad Choices link at http://srp.viacom.com/sitefaq.htmlfor more information about this Site and other options you may have regarding Customized Advertising across Devices.\n\n* Automatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs. Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function. For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.\n\n* You shall still receive advertisements. Deleting or disabling Third Party Service Providers', Advertisers' or the Site's Tracking Technologies does not mean that you shall no longer receive online ads. If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you shall continue to see ads on this Site and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Site to set Tracking Technologies for frequency capping purposes as described in the \"Information Collected Through the Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies\" section.\n\n* Limitations Regarding Web Beacons. Web beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled Tracking Technologies to track your activities. \n\n* How to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies). Control of Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies) Must Be Handled Separately. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER. Deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Site through the above options shall not remove Flash LSOs. For more information about Flash LSOs and how to remove them from your computer, please visit http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html. If you remove Flash LSOs, you may not have access to certain features of the Site and some of our other services may not function properly.\n\n* Other Effects of Managing Tracking Technologies. In addition to the above, if you delete or disable Tracking Technologies set by the Site, the Site may no longer be able to offer certain features or functionality to you, such as remembering your preferences, remembering your username, enabling Single VII Sign-On, saving your player settings or other purposes described in \"Other Information Collected By Us\" above, and some of our other services may not function properly. In addition to the above, if you disable or delete Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers (or if such Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled on your Device or browser), the Site may no longer be able to offer certain functionality to you, such as enabling SMN login or saving your player settings and certain services or advertisements may not work for such Devices or browsers.\n\n* Mobile Platforms. Certain mobile platforms, such as Apple or Google, may offer users choice regarding the Identifiers we, Third Party Service Providers or Advertisers may access and use, which may not be browser cookie based. We encourage you to review and understand the choices that such mobile platforms may provide to you regarding these Identifiers.\n\n* Certain Identifiers. Certain Identifiers we set may not be deleted, blocked or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such Identifiers rely on, or are associated with, browser cookies or other Tracking Technologies. \n\n* Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit \"do-not-track\" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. \n\nWe currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals. Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for Customized Advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in this Section 5.2.3 and in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.\n\n6.

Sharing and Disclosure of Information.\n\n7.1 Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information. \n\nWe may disclose your Personal Information within the VII family or to third parties under the circumstances described below. \n\n7.1.1 Disclosure to VII; Single VII Sign-On. In addition to disclosing certain Information to VII in connection with Single VII Sign-On, we may disclose Personal Information to VII for marketing, administrative and/or other purposes.

I love first wives club and bigger. I wish they had more categories that made sense instead of it just saying “more black content.” It’s hard to find what your looking for. There is a show I was looking forward to watching that is on the app that can’t be played due to rights restrictions. So that can be a bit frustrating. I am looking for a bit more customization on the app meaning; being able to have separate user names and being able to create a watch later list. Ideally for 9.99 a month i would hope their would be content on there for the whole family like; Moesha, the pj’s, Johnson family vacation. I know these aren’t created by BET but perhaps having some family friendly originals. I also notice that the shows that are currently on BET aren’t featured on BET+ like sista’s or hit the floor.\n\nOther than those suggestions.

It freezes CONSTANTLY while you’re watching a show, and on some episodes, you’ll be lucky to get through one scene without the app freezing! You’ll be playing the guessing game on a lot of the scenes because at times all you can hear is the audio, yet no movement of the screen because it’s frozen. Also annoying that there’s no “Continue Watching” feature on this app (similar to Netflix), so if you decide you want to finish the rest of the show/movie you’re watching at a later time, you have to go look for it. \n\nBET is already on the decline as a network, so if this app is supposed to revive it, then it’ll need to be MUCH better than this. Because I’m not gonna continue to pay $10 a month for a glitchy app with mostly reruns and old movies on it, especially not when many of the original shows that are supposed to be exclusive to the BET+ app eventually end up being broadcast on regular BET anyway. These aren’t the old days when BET was the only game in town for Black audiences. There are A LOT of other apps catering to the Black demographic that has better value (some even free).

The video quality on this app needs to get better. I tried to binge watch one of my favorite sitcoms “Martin” and it was very difficult to watch. The videos would get blurry. Sometimes when I pause an episode or replay it back for a few seconds it causes the episode to start from the beginning. I would have to exit the app and then go back in and find the part where I left off. On season 1 episode 24 the video froze in the first 6 min however the audio continued to play. Then it went back to normal around 9 min left of the episode. It was hard for me to enjoy the rest of the episode due to the technical difficulties that occurred earlier. Hopefully, you guys can rectify these issues as soon as possible.

For one, the options aren’t great— they promote Tyler Perry’s works as if they have all of them, but a lot of fan favorites are missing, so that was misleading. Also, they could put more shows on there such as The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Girlfriends, Black-Ish, or classics like Good Times and The Jeffersons. Or any of their shows such as past BET Awards shows, 106 and Park, etc. Anything beats the lackey selection, it’s a shame. As a hard-core fan of the show “Martin”, I found myself EXTREMELY disappointed that every single episode is cut how they air it on the channel; if I’m paying $9.99/month, the least they could do is show the FULL episode and not leave parts out of the episodes. \n\nIt is definitely NOT worth the $9.99 per month. It makes no sense how Disney+ is only $6.99/month and their selection is immaculate. That and other streaming services make BET+ look like a scam. Do not buy.","title":"Not worth the cost","userName":"nianxah"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6137408166","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-29T21:46:34Z","rating":1,"review":"Can someone please explain to me why the apps for us by us are usually GARBAGE! Always always always issues with BET (\u0026 OWN). BET+ FINALLY got an app for the Apple TV. BET+ is $9.99 a month so if you charging, make sure the product is worthy. I tried to watch The Oval on BET+ and after certain episodes, it asked me to pay for it or the episode just won’t play. Also, the BET awards were last night. Why wasn’t it uploaded to BET+ for the customers paying for the app to see. Bottom line is I have to have the BET+ app \u0026 the regular BET app. UNACCEPTABLE!!!! It’s great to support your own, but not when they are giving you poor products that you have to pay for. Get it together BET or stop charging for BET+ until it’s complete. I’m canceling BET+ membership until they get their act together. May as well use the free app even though that’s faulty to.

I was watching the games people play and on the last episode I can’t watch it because it says “sorry, this video is not available” that’s really upsetting being that, that show was the reason I got the app. I don’t think I’m going to continue my subscription I’ll just have to find another app.","title":"App is not really that good...","userName":"NyeNye98"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6734927170","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-12-09T18:27:39Z","developerResponse":{"id":19810141,"body":"We apologize for this experience.

When I pause whatever I am watching at the moment and go back to it the overlay screen doesn’t go away so I have to exit and restart the app. I have contacted customer support which is no help. I was told first to be sure I have at least 3gb of storage (I have over 30gb) I was told to uninstall and reinstall the app which I have done several times and the issue is still ongoing. I was then told that my internet speed may be the issue and that I need a download speed of 1.5Mbps or more which my internet is high speed and this is the only app that gives me any problems.
