        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love DailyBurn. I’ve been a member since I had my daughter in 2015 and I truly feel like the trainers are my own, personal friends. I’m an RN and can sometimes have an erratic schedule, so working out can be difficult. I had been using the app for the days when I couldn’t make it to the gym, but after the lockdowns last year and we were stuck in the house it became my primary means of exercise. When our gym started accepting members again in the fall we ended up canceling our membership and now I just use DailyBurn. The variety of workouts is fantastic— I especially love the bodyweight, no equipment classes— and the mobility and yoga series are also amazing. I know I’m going to get a great workout no matter what I choose. I don’t own a scale so I don’t know how my weight has responded to DailyBurn, but I do know that I fit my clothes more comfortably, I feel more confident, and I actually look forward to working out. And because I work out in my garage my 5-year-old is able to participate instead of hiding away in a gym child care center, and hopefully I can be a good role model for positive self-image. Anja, Phoenix, Cody, Dara, Cece, Briohny— Thank you for keeping me going and being so excellent at what you do!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Daily Burn has been a game changer for me. The variety of programs plus the daily live show keeps things fresh. Love that I can take it with me when I travel. I often use the audio workouts or the LTF workout on my phone when using a hotel gym. The iPad version is great for using at home when the family is watching TV. Otherwise I also use this on the Roku. <br /><br />Definitely sign up for 5he Facebook group. You can chat with the trainers and get inspiration from other users. It is an oasis of positivity in an otherwise wild world of fitness apps. Unlike other video programs, Daily Burn isn’t trying to get you to buy shakes, become a coach/MLM salesperson, or purchase overpriced protein powders. <br /><br />The very few times I’ve needed technical or account help, the Daily Burn staff has been VERY responsive.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app made me fall in love with working out all over again! The quality, the quantity and the variety of workouts is unlike anything I’ve seen before. There is every type of exercise and every level to choose from. The production quality is beyond amazing. <br /><br />If you love being in shape but have fallen into a rut, this app will change your life. I look forward to each session, knowing there’s a seemingly unlimited amount of challenging, fun workouts available. (I don’t work for this company but would probably try to if I were younger!) <br /><br />I’ve worked out in many places and along with many different videos—this one is a 10 out of 10! They have a 30-day free trial so you can see the wonderfulness for yourself.</p>

I’ve been a member since I had my daughter in 2015 and I truly feel like the trainers are my own, personal friends. I’m an RN and can sometimes have an erratic schedule, so working out can be difficult. I had been using the app for the days when I couldn’t make it to the gym, but after the lockdowns last year and we were stuck in the house it became my primary means of exercise. When our gym started accepting members again in the fall we ended up canceling our membership and now I just use DailyBurn. The variety of workouts is fantastic— I especially love the bodyweight, no equipment classes— and the mobility and yoga series are also amazing. I know I’m going to get a great workout no matter what I choose. I don’t own a scale so I don’t know how my weight has responded to DailyBurn, but I do know that I fit my clothes more comfortably, I feel more confident, and I actually look forward to working out. And because I work out in my garage my 5-year-old is able to participate instead of hiding away in a gym child care center, and hopefully I can be a good role model for positive self-image.

I often use the audio workouts or the LTF workout on my phone when using a hotel gym. The iPad version is great for using at home when the family is watching TV. Otherwise I also use this on the Roku. \n\nDefinitely sign up for 5he Facebook group. You can chat with the trainers and get inspiration from other users. It is an oasis of positivity in an otherwise wild world of fitness apps. Unlike other video programs, Daily Burn isn’t trying to get you to buy shakes, become a coach/MLM salesperson, or purchase overpriced protein powders. \n\nThe very few times I’ve needed technical or account help, the Daily Burn staff has been VERY responsive.","title":"3 years strong","userName":"SusanMcMc"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3443649879","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-11-21T15:03:52Z","developerResponse":{"id":6258220,"body":"Thanks so much for your thoughtful review!

The instructors come from diverse fitness backgrounds - track, kickboxing, dance cardio, weight lifting, etc - and it’s fun because they’ll include some of that in their workouts.

I haven't exercised with regularity in qt years and I travel a lot for work. I started this for my birthday. At first I was a little intimidated by the pace of the daily burn routine, but then someone in the group suggested I try the True Beginner program. It’s an 8 week program that will allow me to work up to the daily burn. This is great!!  I don't feel intimidated. I can tell it’s working because the muscles in my core are screaming!  I have the iPad and iPhone apps installed on my phone and at home I use it with my Roku. It doesn’t take a lot of space, so I can do this in any hotel room. If I could bolster my courage, I do this at the airport too!","title":"I’m a 57 yr old return to exercise","userName":"MsKerry_M"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4004063499","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-04-12T18:37:07Z","developerResponse":{"id":8320719,"body":"Love this feedback, thanks so much for sharing!","modified":"2019-04-22T20:18:24Z"},"rating":5,"review":"I have a gym that I have been frequently going to but on those mornings that I don’t want to go but still want to work out (which are frequent) I know that I can crawl out of bed and put DB on my phone TV or iPad and do a short workout (10min) just to say I did something or a 20-40min workout that eliminates all the extra time and hassle of getting ready and going to the gym. In addition, every workout (regardless of time) makes me feel like I did what was needed to be done for the day, and sometimes i have so much fun that I do another one!

Their content is frequently updated and their apps allow contents to be filtered and searched easily. \n\nHowever, when compared to its competitors, Daily Burn lacks innovations and its apps do not integrate well with Apple Health. There is no way to track heart rates using Apple Watch (or any other tracking devices). Only the iPhone app can write records to Apple Health but the records are very generic. A 5 minutes meditation class is recorded as “interval training” just like other exercises. None of the workouts get recorded under the correct type. Activities on other platforms are not synced so your workouts in Apple TV / iPad / web are not recorded. There also lacks a way for users to review their previous workouts in the apps.","title":"Great content, lacks integrations and
