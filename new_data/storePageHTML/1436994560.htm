        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>We&#39;ve got a treat for your ears...the magic of Dynamic Spatial Audio has arrived!<br />-----<br /><br />With Portal our ultimate goal is to deliver an experience that allows you to truly escape and &quot;feel like you&#39;re there&quot; in the midst of some of the world&#39;s greatest locations.<br /><br />Sound has always been at the heart of this experience and we&#39;ve been thrilled by recent advances in Spatial Audio technology that have allowed us to push what&#39;s possible in terms of realism and immersion.<br /><br />If you own a pair of AirPods Pro, AirPods Max or 3rd generation AirPods this release adds support for Dynamic Spatial Audio which uses head tracking technology to anchor the soundscapes around you. If you turn your head your virtual surroundings will remain in place, just as they would do in real life.<br /><br />It&#39;s been a labour of love and the culmination of almost 12 months of Research &amp; Development, requiring us to completely re-engineer our entire sound production and delivery pipeline, all in the pursuit of a natural &amp; realistic experience.<br /><br />We&#39;ve worked with the world&#39;s greatest Spatial Audio field recordists to re-release a large proportion of the library with full support for Dynamic Spatial Audio and we&#39;ve partnered with Atmoky, a world-leading Spatial Audio R&amp;D company, to implement state-of-the-art Spatial Audio rendering within the app that&#39;s specifically tailored for natural ambiences.<br /><br />Even if you don&#39;t have a pair of AirPods that support headtracking you&#39;ll still hear the benefits over the coming months as we release new content using the upgraded technology and further push what&#39;s possible through both headphone and speaker playback... :)<br /><br />---<br /><br />Additionally, 3.5.3 includes the following changes:<br />- We&#39;ve added more details about what&#39;s included in Portal Premium.<br />- The audio controls now fit better on smaller iPad screen sizes.<br />- Launching Portal with &#39;mix with others&quot; turned on whilst another audio source is playing no longer pauses the other App&#39;s audio.<br />- Shortcuts and Quick Actions now automatically start playback if Portal was previously in a paused state.</p>

    Incredible for Sleep and Getting Work Done

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app was a game changer for me. I’ve always struggled to go to sleep. I have tried music, sleeping masks, white noise, muscle relaxation, etc. This app was really helpful in transporting me to beautiful, serene locations, putting my mind at ease, and finally allowing me to sink into the depths of unconsciousness at night, It’s soundscapes are beautifully realized visually, with varied, 3D immersive sound. I discovered that some of the soundscapes, especially the barley field and the cloud rainforest, were great aids to helping me write and work without getting distracted. Overall, the app has been a great improvement to my quality of life, which I did not expect initially.<br /><br />I initially got the free version and was really satisfied with the included features, so I upgraded. I have to say the monetization model was really wonderful, encouraging me to support developers without making me feel like I had to pay for a good experience. Recently the app was updated with tons of new sounds from Scotland and Slovenia. It now includes a subscription model, but for the quantity and quality of content, it seems well worth it, especially because it will help the developers flesh out the app even more. On top of that, they gave everyone who had purchased the app free access to everything, which is incredibly generous! I look forward to great new content in the future. Thank you so much!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi Quantumlightgamer06, thank you so much for sharing your Portal experience and not least your incredibly kind words. Knowing that Portal has helped improve the quality of your life has put the biggest smiles on our faces - it&#39;s a goal that we hoped and dreamed Portal would achieve when we first launched and remains our driving ambition going forward! Thank you for your feedback and for being one of our early paid adopters, without your trust, support and encouragement during those early days it&#39;s unlikely we would have been able to grow Portal to where we are to-date. We hope you enjoy escaping to the beautiful Slovenian Alps and the Scottish Highlands, as well as a lifetime of escapes around the world to come! Nick.</p>

    Incredible just got better!!!
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I originally was overjoyed to come across an app that I loved that actually had a one time payment fee. The design and elegance of this app along with the amazingly rendered sounds and visuals sold me instantly! It’s been an incredible experience sleeping and working to these sounds. Today I open my app to realize that there’s been an update and a huge one at that! This app that I already love just blew me out of the water again! I’m guessing since I was one of the original purchasers I got the whole new library of sounds for free as there is a subscription model now. I went through each new sound seeing which ones I wanted to pick to download and by the end of it I pretty much downloaded all of them because they were so good! To anyone reading this, this is easily worth the price of subscription at this point since it seems like there’s going to be more and more sounds that are going to be put out.<br /><br />In summary keep up the great work and I really appreciate the team taking care of their original customers instead of pushing them out like some other apps that transition to subscriptions have done. Also was this a one time promotion for original purchasers or would I be a lifetime subscriber? If it’s the latter then I’m going to be incredibly happy 😆.</p>

As a small independent team we&#39;ve really appreciated everyone who&#39;s supported us in the early days by purchasing the app and wanted to show our appreciation, especially in these uncertain times, by providing all our existing paid users a free upgrade to Lifetime Membership - we hope you enjoy escaping to the Slovenian Alps and the Scottish Highlands in this update and a lifetime more escapes in the future!

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>LOVING this app. I love that it was a one time purchase for DLC rather than subscription. Seriously thank you. i wouldn’t have been able to pull the trigger for a subscription but happy to buy DLC. The sound is exquisite and the video footage is gorgeous without obvious loops. The feature that got me the most excited and convinced me to buy the full version of the app was the ability to mix it with audiobooks and other apps. I’ve been looking for a way to add background sound to my Audible app when i listen to audiobooks for forever! Now this is my absolute Go-To for ambient sound. I leave my ipad by my bed with the ocean soundscape running while i fall asleep and i’m out. A great feature to add would be the ability to airplay it to an apple TV. Right now you can mirror your screen to the TV like you would with any other app but there’s not a built in casting feature. Still that’s just a wish list item for me. This app was made with love and care and special attention to a LOT of handy above and beyond features. It’s not a money grab and is excellent value for what you get. I hope the devs keep up the great work. Can’t wait to see what new environments come next! Maybe an urban setting or a coffee shop?  Or maybe more beautiful locations from around the globe.  FIVE STARS.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi V713321, thanks so much for your wonderful feedback! We&#39;re delighted that you&#39;re enjoying the app, especially the mix feature. As a fun fact, the mix feature actually came about as a happy accident. While developing the app I&#39;d started playing some music and hadn&#39;t stopped the Portal sounds...and realised it actually worked really well so added it as a feature to the app :) On the Apple TV front this is most definitely in our plans for the future, unfortunately we can&#39;t provide a definitive timeframe on this just yet but please bear with us. In the meantime, we do have some fantastic new soundscapes coming out soon which we hope you&#39;ll thoroughly enjoy. Many thanks, Nick. </p>

This should be fixed now. Please reach out if you are still experiencing the issue after updating.\n\n- Video Freezes: Portal videos no longer pause when you remove your headphones. Now only the Audio playback pauses. (Pro-tip: you can long-press on the speaker icon to resume audio playback.)\n\n- Clock Hiding: Several customers got in touch confused with how the clock hiding and auto-hide interface options interacted. We've combined these into a single option called \"Clock \u0026 Controls Visibility\" you can find it in \"Settings\".\n\n- Haptics Confusion: Haptic options for breathing exercises are now only shown if your devices supports them. So that's iPhone 7 or newer running iOS13 and up.\n\n- Download Indicators: Checkmarks for previously downloaded portals had vanished from the library but their back now.

I have tried music, sleeping masks, white noise, muscle relaxation, etc. This app was really helpful in transporting me to beautiful, serene locations, putting my mind at ease, and finally allowing me to sink into the depths of unconsciousness at night, It’s soundscapes are beautifully realized visually, with varied, 3D immersive sound. I discovered that some of the soundscapes, especially the barley field and the cloud rainforest, were great aids to helping me write and work without getting distracted. Overall, the app has been a great improvement to my quality of life, which I did not expect initially.\n\nI initially got the free version and was really satisfied with the included features, so I upgraded. I have to say the monetization model was really wonderful, encouraging me to support developers without making me feel like I had to pay for a good experience. Recently the app was updated with tons of new sounds from Scotland and Slovenia. It now includes a subscription model, but for the quantity and quality of content, it seems well worth it, especially because it will help the developers flesh out the app even more. On top of that, they gave everyone who had purchased the app free access to everything, which is incredibly generous! I look forward to great new content in the future.

The design and elegance of this app along with the amazingly rendered sounds and visuals sold me instantly! It’s been an incredible experience sleeping and working to these sounds. Today I open my app to realize that there’s been an update and a huge one at that! This app that I already love just blew me out of the water again! I’m guessing since I was one of the original purchasers I got the whole new library of sounds for free as there is a subscription model now. I went through each new sound seeing which ones I wanted to pick to download and by the end of it I pretty much downloaded all of them because they were so good! To anyone reading this, this is easily worth the price of subscription at this point since it seems like there’s going to be more and more sounds that are going to be put out.\n\nIn summary keep up the great work and I really appreciate the team taking care of their original customers instead of pushing them out like some other apps that transition to subscriptions have done. Also was this a one time promotion for original purchasers or would I be a lifetime subscriber? If it’s the latter then I’m going to be incredibly happy 😆.","title":"Incredible just got better!!!","userName":"Cerazo"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5929941882","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-05-11T02:47:01Z","developerResponse":{"id":15491483,"body":"Hi V713321, thanks so much for your wonderful feedback!

Seriously thank you. i wouldn’t have been able to pull the trigger for a subscription but happy to buy DLC. The sound is exquisite and the video footage is gorgeous without obvious loops. The feature that got me the most excited and convinced me to buy the full version of the app was the ability to mix it with audiobooks and other apps. I’ve been looking for a way to add background sound to my Audible app when i listen to audiobooks for forever! Now this is my absolute Go-To for ambient sound. I leave my ipad by my bed with the ocean soundscape running while i fall asleep and i’m out. A great feature to add would be the ability to airplay it to an apple TV. Right now you can mirror your screen to the TV like you would with any other app but there’s not a built in casting feature. Still that’s just a wish list item for me. This app was made with love and care and special attention to a LOT of handy above and beyond features. It’s not a money grab and is excellent value for what you get. I hope the devs keep up the great work. Can’t wait to see what new environments come next! Maybe an urban setting or a coffee shop?  Or maybe more beautiful locations from around the globe.

I’ve been looking for a decent app that plays sound like this for awhile. It helps me to sleep or really focus when I am studying. Some of the other apps just haven’t done it for me, and while searching for a new one I found Portal. You get a few “portal’s” for free, but have to purchase the rest. For me, this wasn’t an issue. I happily paid the $3.99 to unlock all the features as a one-time payment. Some apps make you pay for each separately, so it was nice to only have to pay once to unlock it all. The sounds are so crystal clear and sound great. The look and feel of the app is also very nice. You can hook it up to philips hue lights which I don’t have yet, but plan on buying in the future so I think that will be cool. I really only have one complaint. In the portals there is a guided breathing exercise, and it tells you on the screen when to breathe in and out. I really wish there was a way to have it narrated for you. Sometimes I like to close my eyes when doing breathing exercises and obviously I can’t see the screen when my eyes are closed. Other then that, this app is awesome! 5 stars for sure.

It really helps me reduce stress and relax my mind, especially when everything is virtual and you have to look at a computer for a long time.

But most important thing to note is they allowed the users who previously paid the $4 to buy the app to keep the full version along with all the updates, so when you purchase from this devoloper you can be assured you will keep what you paid for regardless of any future changes in the pricing model, and that is hard thing to come by now a days in the apple world, so thankyou!\n\nSuggestions: I also would love to see some more light autumn/forest sounds, maybe without birds (or at least light bird sound in distance and spread out a bit) in future, there are lots of water ones wich are great but more like the barley field one (wich is PERFECTLY done!)

Some background: I am ADHD and so I can always find distractions even when there aren’t any. I once caught myself admiring a table instead of reading my textbook. My way to minimize this had been music, but I hadn’t found ambiance that wasn’t distracting and lasted for a while. Portal fixes both of these problems. Especially once you open up the full library, the sounds it provides are amazing and perfect for helping you focus or escape. All of it’s sounds are amazing and I’ve gotten a real boost in efficiency thanks to the app. My only wish is for more sounds. The 14 they provide are all very effective and neat, but I’m very tempted to ask for more. For instance: they provide mainly nature sounds form around the world. Maybe one or two city (I’m a suburb boy) soundscapes would be interesting. Also, maybe another synthesized sound scape like the whale or jellyfish would be nice.

Originally I downloaded this for the sounds which can help me find calm as I’m falling asleep or when I’m relaxing reading a book, but the fact that it had a breathing exercise in addition to that was a nice feature. I feel most apps either have one thing I need and missing the other when it comes to calm and relaxation. I don’t feel calm or relaxed by listening to voices compared to many other apps out there for similar techniques.

your sleep, productivity, stress levels and overall mental wellbeing?\n\nThe truth is they have a profound impact and for me (hi there, I'm Nick the Founder of Portal!) it took an episode of
