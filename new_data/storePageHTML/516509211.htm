        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I used an old app for many years but eventually it became incompatible with latest iOS and I had to change. I tried 6 different apps and this one trounced the competition at the time. That was 3 years ago, and since then, the app has gotten better in many ways.<br /><br />This service and development teams are incredible. Super-responsive, they understand when you have issues and and I’m constantly impressed with how quickly they’re able to implement changes and get them out to their users.<br /><br />One complaint about a recent change: If you have a meter that syncs entries directly with the app, you no longer have the ability to adjust the time of the entry. I liked to do this for times when I end up waiting 15-45 mins after testing to take my pre-meal shot, since getting precise timing of insulin injections is more important than precise timing of BG readings while fasting. Sadly, this is no longer an option and instead the only option is to delete the synced entry and recreate it manually, which is MUCH more painful. I wish they would restore users’ the ability to manage their own data how they see fit.</p>

    Fabulous app for all types of diabetes

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>First: premium version offers unlimited strips for $49 per month!!!!!   <br /><br />Ok now that I got that out of the way. This app is amazing. I tried several and this is by far my favorite. The app itself as a stand-alone is easy to use and lets you enter the usual blood sugars, insulin, carb counts, etc. plus notes on what you ate and then you can also tag the type of food and what you were doing (exercising, at work, etc). The app syncs directly with accu chek meters. It can also sync with Apple health (and by extension with garmin or with One Touch meters). By far the best feature is the premium subscription which gets you unlimited test strips and in app access to a certified diabetic educator. This has been incredibly helpful for me and is  very reasonably priced. <br /><br />The monster animation and level of humor in the app is fun too. I hope that they continue to add challenges and/or make the challenges automatic (like Apple does if you have an Apple Watch). Also I’d love a way to input sleep for tracking purposes (like I input what time I go to bed, what time I fall asleep and what time I get up in the AM and the app calculates my total sleep hours).</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been looking for an app like this for a long time. I had one similar a few years ago but for some reason they discontinued it. The best thing I can say is not only how easy it is to use but that it gives you a A1C average. I won’t know how accurate (close) it is until I go to the dr in late July for my Diabeties (type 2)check up.<br />I really like the way it shows your daily average &amp; the whole screen layout so you can see everything at once. I wish there was a way to put in order the items that you chose when you record your readings like before meals, after meals etc. I would like to arrange them in the order of importance to me &amp; all the other items that I don’t use or don’t use much  I could move to the end.<br />Also when I record what I eat if there were some way of bringing up something you had recorded before ( I eat out a lot because of traveling so I’m stuck basically eating the same things because I know how that food affects my blood sugar). Just a few ideas to throw around.<br />I definitely highly recommend MySugar App!!!</p>

INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Responsible entity\n1.1.1 mySugr GmbH, located in Vienna at the business address Trattnerhof 1/5 OG, 1010 Vienna and registered in the Company Register of Vienna Commercial Court under FN 376086 v (“mySugr”), is the stated responsible entity under the data protection regulations. In other words we are the company that decides on the purpose and means of processing the personal data of our users (“User Data”) and is therefore responsible for its security and compliance with the applicable laws.\n\n1.1.2 As the responsible entity we are subject, for example, to information requirements that we wish to fulfill in connection with this privacy notice. We also provide additional information within our products, e.g. we may ask you for a new consent or explain the consequences of revocation. The information in our products does not contradict this privacy notice, but rather supplements it with brief and easily readable information so that you can make decisions more easily. This privacy notice and the additional information are easily accessible at any time from within our products.\n\n1.2 Structure and consent concept\n1.2.1 This privacy notice informs you about the purposes and scope of processing your User Data, as well as data transfers, and your extensive rights. As our offer is exclusively aimed at persons with diabetes, your use typically already provides information on your health condition. We therefore only process User Data as health data with your consent. We differentiate as follows:\n\n1.2.1.1 “Necessary Processing” describes how we process the User Data required to fulfill the contract. Without this consent the use of our products is not possible from a legal and a factual point of view because our services depend on this processing.\n\n1.2.1.2 “Processing for Product Improvement” explains how you can help us and other users, with your consent, by allowing us to use your data in particular to develop algorithms for therapy management, improve the product and so forth without us contacting you for advertising purposes etc. You can also use the products without giving us this consent - but your consent improves the database in the interest of all users so that we can improve our product more quickly.\n\n1.2.1.3 “Processing for Marketing Purposes” describes how we contact you for marketing purposes, with your consent, e.g. by email, notifications etc. Here too you may use the products without consent but with your consent you will receive interesting information on our products or if, for example, your health insurance company covers new services.\n\n1.2.1.4 In “General Information” we have assembled the information that applies to all of the above consents to avoid repetition.\n\nThe relevant categories are described in more detail below. You may provide the relevant consents upon registration or later via the account settings. You may revoke any consents at any time via the account settings or by sending an email to support@mysugr.com. In such an instance we will inform you about the consequences of the revocation. The lawfulness of the processing prior to revocation remains unaffected.\n\n1.2.2 In some cases, the processing may take place independently of consent on the basis of statutory principles (e.g. medical device regulations). We will inform you accordingly in appropriate cases.\n\n2. NECESSARY PROCESSING\nIf you grant your consent, we process the User Data listed below in order to be able to provide our services. If you do not consent to this necessary processing, you cannot use the services of mySugr. You may provide your consents during the registration process and manage them in the account settings.\n\n2.1 Necessary and optional User Data\n2.1.1 In order to protect your User Data, our services can only be used in connection with a user account. To create a user account we require and process the following User Data:\n\nEmail address\nPassword (we only save a checksum)\nmySugr ID (we provide this after registration)\nRegistration date\nStatus of consents\nWhen using the mySugr app: Device ID, manufacturer, device type, operating system version\nLanguage, country, time zone\nIP address.\n\n2.1.2 All other information is optional and self-explanatory in the input masks. Such optional entries include:\n\nPersonal Master Data: first name, last name, address, date of birth/age, gender, telephone number.\n\nMedical Master Data: diabetes type, diagnosis year, insulin therapy (pen/pump), blood glucose target range, height, weight, meter/therapy device, medication, type of insulin, basal settings, correction factors, carbs / insulin ratio.\n\nCommercial and Usage Data\nApp store download, purchase, invoices, payment status, payment method (credit card, bank account, etc.) insurance number, mySugr PRO status, vouchers redeemed, IP address, device ID, operating system, browser type and version, token, activity events for customization, support queries.\n\nMedical Data\nApp entries such as date/time/time zone/place, type and duration of activities (breakfast, office work, sport etc.), food intake/meal/ingredients, pills taken/injections, blood glucose measurements, notes/text, blood pressure, weight, HbA1c, ketones, steps, images/photos, medication, tags, points, imported values; sensor data such as start date/time, end date/time, time zone, sensor value, type; temporary basal rate, date; app settings such as display options, activated integrations; or coaching (status, targets, other illnesses).\n\n2.1.3 If you wish, you can operate the user account under an assumed name (pseudonym), i.e. you do not have to state your real name. You can also enter any email address that you set up especially for us – however it must work so that we can send you important warnings.\n\nThe scope of the data recorded by mySugr depends on your registration and use of our products. We only process the User Data that you actively and voluntarily provide to mySugr. The entry of requested User Data is however a requirement for the comprehensive use of our products. If you do not enter optional data the associated functionality of our products is limited accordingly. For example our Logbook or Bolus Calculator require detailed (voluntary) entry of your data in order to ensure optimal use.\n\n2.1.4 In addition to the entries you provide voluntarily, there is also the option of independently activating or deactivating the recording of certain data in the settings of our apps and other software of your device (e.g. operating system, other apps, app stores etc.). If you have questions, please contact support@mysugr.com.\n\n2.2 Necessary purposes\n\n2.2.1 All the necessary purposes of our processing are associated with providing our services:\n\nOrder, delivery, support, and billing of our products (including goods from our cooperation partners) require the entry and processing of certain data in order to process your order.\n\nInstallation of our apps leads to technical and device-related data recordings such as the device ID.\n\nRegistration leads to the creation of your mySugr ID using the email address and password.\n\nThe provision of our services requires you to voluntarily and actively enter data depending on the function and each function describes the purpose for which the data is needed.\n\nCommunication from mySugr with you within our apps or via other electronic messaging services (e.g. email, messenger, telephone) where this is required to support or troubleshoot our products. This is how we process any comments and queries that you may have via various communication channels when using mySugr. The most important example is our support service, which you can access at support@mysugr.com. Please therefore think about which information and data you want to give in your active communication with us - this is solely your decision. For our part, communication with users may be necessary either by email, in-app card, or push notification. This is how we inform you about updates to our products and provide important security advice as well as assistance associated with your usage. This support communication - as an essential part of our products - is sent to users notwithstanding whether they have subscribed to our Newsletter or not.\n\nTherapy devices (e.g. blood glucose meters) can be paired with your device which enables data to be transferred to our apps.\n\nHealth apps, such as those by Apple, and other connected services also enable data to be exchanged with our apps. But synchronization only takes place if you activate this in the settings of our apps, namely, if you use the function.\n\n2.2.2 Use of our apps and extensions requires you to actively and voluntarily enter data. You will find additional selection options in the settings of our apps. To resolve an error in the app we require, for example, crash reports that we can use for troubleshooting purposes to determine the circumstances of the problem. In addition, the key data of your device and your usage behavior are recorded as our contractual fulfillment, above all, means customizing our products i.e. processing individual user information, for example, depending on your location (also relevant for the search function), diabetes type or type of therapy (both are, for instance, relevant for configuring the user interface). An automated analysis of user behavior is performed exclusively for the purpose of customizing your use when fulfilling the contract and has no legal effect for you.\n\n3. PROCESSING FOR PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT\nIf you consent, we also process your User Data beyond the necessary usage described in section 2 above to improve our products and services as described in more detail below.\n\n3.1 Additional data\nIn general, we use the same User Data to improve our products as stated in section 2. In addition, mySugr may also record the following User Data:\n\nUsage Data\nActivity events that allow us to understand how you use our products. This enables us to see how our products are used and for example where menu designs can be optimized.\n\n3.2 Purpose of product improvement \nAs a result of fast-moving technological progress, we have to continually analyze, develop, test, and improve our products and their interactions, in order to ensure that our content benefits users in the most effective way. To achieve this, we conduct usage and security tests and the knowledge gained is incorporated into improved new versions of our products such as the app. These improvements are also provided to you via regular updates.\n\n4. PROCESSING FOR MARKETING PURPOSES\n\n4.1 Newsletter\n\n4.1.1 We would like to send you interesting information on products and services in addition to the contractual scope (including information from carefully selected partners) and invitations to participate in surveys or other sales promotions and marketing activities (“Newsletter”).\n\n4.1.2 You can select whether you want to subscribe to our Newsletter (opt in). You can revoke your consent at any time via the link in the Newsletter or the account settings.\n\n4.2 Other types of marketing\n\n4.2.1 Other consents, e.g. for surveys, notifications, or customized offers, are obtained as required when you are logged in. We always explain to you why we need certain data and also how you can revoke the consent.\n\n4.2.2 Please be aware that we may show you offers within the app without processing your personal data. You will also see these non-customized advertisements if you have not provided your consent.\n\n5. USAGE FOR STATUTORY PURPOSES\n\n5.1 Scientific research and statistics\nmySugr is committed to the science of all aspects of diabetes. Therefore, anonymous User Data may also be used for the purposes of research and statistics (always whilst complying with the recognized ethical scientific standards) and internal analyses. This is used mainly to determine and improve the effectiveness of techniques for controlling and treating diabetes. The legal basis for this is Article 9 (2) j) GDPR.\n\n5.2 Enforcement of rights\nThe use of personal data may also be necessary to prevent abuse by users or to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims. We may be forced into disclosure due to binding laws, court or official decisions and instructions, criminal investigation, or in the public interest. In such cases, the storage and processing of your data is permitted by law without your consent. The legal basis for this is Article 9 (2) f) GDPR.\n\n5.3 In accordance with medical device legislation\nFinally, as the manufacturer or distributor of a medical device, we are subject to increased requirements for monitoring the functionality of our product. This vigilance system required for regulatory purposes may also involve the processing of personal data. The legal basis for this is Article 9 (2) i) GDPR.\n\n6. GENERAL INFORMATION\n\n6.1 Purpose limitation and security\n\n6.1.1 mySugr uses your personal data exclusively for the purposes determined in this privacy notice and the relevant consents. We ensure that each processing is restricted to the extent necessary for its purpose.\n\n6.1.2 Each processing always guarantees adequate security and confidentiality of your personal data. This covers protection from unauthorized and illegal processing, unintentional loss, unintentional destruction or damage using appropriate technical and organizational measures. We use strict internal processes, security features, and the latest encryption methods, always taking into account state-ofthe-art technology and implementation costs.\n\n6.2 Processors\n\n6.2.1 Our products are subject to complex processes that, in light of our millions of users, we have to manage and keep up-to-date. For technical support we therefore use affiliated companies of the Roche Group – F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. - and third-party suppliers (“Processors”) in order to offer you a comprehensive and optimal use of our products.\n\n6.2.2 mySugr transfers User Data to Processors exclusively within the framework of this privacy notice and only to fulfill the purposes stated in it. Processors work according to our specifications and instructions; they are not permitted to use the personal data of our users for their own or other purposes.\n\n6.2.3 We use Processors offering sufficient guarantees that suitable technical and organizational measures are undertaken in a way that the processing of personal data complies with the statutory requirements and our privacy notice. The protection of the rights of our users is ensured by concluding binding contracts that meet the strict requirements of GDPR.\n\n6.2.4 The third-party suppliers appointed by mySugr may only use other processors (subcontractors) with our prior consent. If a subcontractor does not comply with the same data protection obligations and all of the appropriate security measures that we impose on our Processors, then we will prohibit the hiring of such a subcontractor.\n\n6.3 Encryption, pseudonymization, and anonymization\n\n6.3.1 Each data transfer, without exception and by default, is encrypted during transfer. Using HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure) we ensure that your data is not intercepted by unauthorized third parties.\n\nIn addition, for the purposes of data security and minimization, we also use other processes for the encryption and pseudonymization of User Data. Of course this depends on the type, scope, and purpose of the relevant data processing and takes into account the latest technology. For example, we only disclose User Data that a Processor requires to carry out his tasks.\n\n6.3.2 When a contractual relationship with a Processor is terminated, such Processor must, at mySugr’s discretion, either return all our User’s Data or delete it if there are no statutory storage obligations.\n\n6.3.3 Data that requires no personal reference for processing (e.g. for research and analysis) is subject to anonymization. This prevents a connection to a specific user being made in all cases.\n\n6.4 EU and other countries\n\n6.4.1 We primarily select cooperation partners who are based in or whose servers are located in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA). Data transmission within the EU and EEA is unobjectionable because the GDPR applies in all member states.\n\n6.4.2 In exceptional circumstances we appoint third-party suppliers who are located in or who have servers outside the EU, e.g. innovative companies in Silicon Valley, USA. However, even in these cases your personal data is subject to a high protection level in line with the GDPR – either through an EU adequacy decision, which considers data protection in certain third-party countries to be appropriate (e.g. Switzerland, Israel, and New Zealand), or through certain standard contractual clauses approved by the EU, which the contractual relationships with our contracted data processors are based on, or through comparable legal instruments permitted under the GDPR. In any case, all Processors are subject to the obligations in this privacy notice.\n\n6.4.3 In addition, we ensure that our partners have additional security standards in place, such as individual security measures and data protection provisions or certifications under the GDPR. So, for example, if third-party suppliers are located in the USA they should be subject to the Privacy Shield Framework approved by the EU or comparable internationally recognized security standards.\n\n6.5. Categories of recipients\n\n6.5.1 Our cooperation partners are bound by the agreements signed with mySugr as well as by the GDPR and only process data according to our instructions. We provide our users’ Data only to fulfill the contract:\n\nManufacturers and suppliers require personal data to handle orders for goods. A typical example is the delivery of a blood glucose meter and test strips as part of the mySugr Bundle.\n\nInsurance companies may exchange data with us if you buy our products as part of your health insurance (statutory or private). If applicable, this enables billing based on the tariff of your insurance company.\n\nBookkeeping and payment service providers support us in the ongoing billing of our chargeable products.\n\nCustomer support services and their tools help our customer support to quickly and efficiently handle our users’ inquiries. Here, for example, queries are recorded from various communication channels and grouped according to topics using ticket systems.\n\nAnalysis service providers and their tools help us to understand how users use our products in order for us to provide customized communication and product improvements in the future. This way we can avoid that e.g. a pump user with type 1 diabetes receives messages about type 2 diabetes or pens.\n\nMarketing service providers support us in creating, sorting, customizing, and sending newsletters, emails, and other messages about our products to our users.\n\nHosting and cloud services and their tools are used to store data and to produce anonymized analyses (see section 2.4 above).\n\nReminder: the transfer of data to our Processors and service providers is protected by guarantees such as adequacy decisions, certifications (Privacy Shield) or standard contractual clauses. A copy of such guarantees or information on these can be requested from privacy@mysugr.com.privacy@mysugr.com .\n\n6.5.2 Finally please note that you have the option to directly share certain data with a third party from within our products. This relates, for example, to reports generated in our apps and communication with your healthcare professional or mySugr Coach for therapy advice. You are solely responsible for such data transfers.\n\n6.6 Cookies\nmySugr stores so-called “cookies” to offer you a comprehensive range of functions and make the use of our website more convenient. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device by your browser. Except for the cookies for usage data mentioned in section 6.7, our cookies are used to operate the website. If you do not want to use cookies you can prevent them from being stored using the relevant settings in the browser. Most of our cookies are either deleted at the end of your visit or when the browser is closed (session cookies). If this is not the case, you can check the deletion period in your browser or delete the cookies manually. Please note that this may restrict the functionality or scope of our offer.\n\n6.7 Usage data\nWe only use Google Universal Analytics in the publicly accessible part of our website (no login required), a web analysis service by Google Inc. (“Google”). Google is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield; we also have a processing contract in place with Google.\n\n\nGoogle Universal Analytics uses cookies (see above) to enable analysis of your website use and these may be stored for up to 2 years if you do not delete them before that time. The information generated by the cookie on your use of our website is generally transferred to and stored on a Google server in the USA. We have extended Google Analytics on our website to include the “gat.anonymizeIp();” code in order for IP addresses to be recorded anonymously. At our request, Google only records your IP address in abbreviated form thus ensuring anonymization that does not permit any conclusions to be made about your identity or device. Google abbreviates IP addresses within the EU or other members states which are parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional circumstances is the full IP address transferred to a Google server in the USA and reduced there. At our request Google will use this information to analyze your use of the website in order to provide us with aggregated reports and provide other services associated with Internet usage. The IP address provided by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data.\n\n\nYou can prevent the storage of cookies using the appropriate setting in your browser, as described in section 6.6 above. In addition, you can prevent the processing of the data generated by the cookie relating to your use of the website (incl. the IP address) by Google by installing the browser plugin available under the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de. \n \n\n6.8. Storage and deletion\n\n6.8.1 Your User Data is stored on your device. This data is also stored on our servers. We only use systems that meet GDPR requirements.\n\n6.8.2 During registration you can select whether your data should be stored on servers in the European Union (EU) or the USA. By default, storage is set to the region of your current location during registration. Regardless of the storage location we ensure that the high protection level pursuant to the GDPR is guaranteed; naturally this also applies to data that is stored temporarily at another location or is transferred for processing.\n\n6.8.3 As a rule, mySugr only stores your personal data for the duration of the contract. In exceptional cases, longer storage may be required in order to fulfill post-contractual obligations or to comply with statutory storage obligations or disclosure duties, or to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims (limitation periods).\n\n6.9. Minors\nMinors, below the age of sixteen are only permitted to use our products with the consent of a parent/guardian (see section 3.2.3 of our General Terms and Conditions - T\u0026Cs). This also applies to processing their personal data, which is only legal if and to the extent to which the consent has been obtained by and through the parent/guardian. Otherwise use of our products is prohibited.\n\n6.10. Data protection officer\n\n6.10.1 Our data protection officer is available to answer all data protection questions at privacy@mysugr.com . The data protection officer monitors ‒ independently and not bound by instructions ‒ compliance with all data protection regulations and is subject to strict statutory secrecy and confidentiality obligations.\n\n6.10.2 The data protection officer is widely involved in all questions associated with protecting the personal data of our users. As a trained expert, he monitors our processing on an ongoing basis, informs and regularly advises the entire mySugr team in order to ensure the best possible protection of your User Data.\n\n6.11. Changes\n\n6.11.1 As technology and processes in the Internet as well as data protection legislation are constantly being developed, we have to undertake changes from time to time. We will inform you of changes by appropriate means whilst granting an appropriate advance notice period and if necessary obtaining new consents.\n\n6.11.2 Unless otherwise provided by this privacy notice, the same definitions apply in our T\u0026Cs.\n\n7. YOUR RIGHTS\n\n7.1. Revocation of consents\nIf we process your User Data based on your consent, you may revoke the consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before the revocation. We will continue to provide our services if they do not depend on the consent that has been revoked.\n\n7.2.

I tried 6 different apps and this one trounced the competition at the time. That was 3 years ago, and since then, the app has gotten better in many ways.\n\nThis service and development teams are incredible. Super-responsive, they understand when you have issues and and I’m constantly impressed with how quickly they’re able to implement changes and get them out to their users.\n\nOne complaint about a recent change: If you have a meter that syncs entries directly with the app, you no longer have the ability to adjust the time of the entry. I liked to do this for times when I end up waiting 15-45 mins after testing to take my pre-meal shot, since getting precise timing of insulin injections is more important than precise timing of BG readings while fasting. Sadly, this is no longer an option and instead the only option is to delete the synced entry and recreate it manually, which is MUCH more painful. I wish they would restore users’ the ability to manage their own data how they see fit.","title":"By far the best glucose level tracking app!","userName":"cyber553"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6092420642","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-18T16:40:25Z","developerResponse":{"id":13210513,"body":"Thanks for the awesome review!! :)","modified":"2020-06-18T16:40:25Z"},"rating":5,"review":"First: premium version offers unlimited strips for $49 per month!!!!!   \n\nOk now that I got that out of the way. This app is amazing. I tried several and this is by far my favorite. The app itself as a stand-alone is easy to use and lets you enter the usual blood sugars, insulin, carb counts, etc. plus notes on what you ate and then you can also tag the type of food and what you were doing (exercising, at work, etc). The app syncs directly with accu chek meters. It can also sync with Apple health (and by extension with garmin or with One Touch meters). By far the best feature is the premium subscription which gets you unlimited test strips and in app access to a certified diabetic educator. This has been incredibly helpful for me and is  very reasonably priced. \n\nThe monster animation and level of humor in the app is fun too. I hope that they continue to add challenges and/or make the challenges automatic (like Apple does if you have an Apple Watch). Also I’d love a way to input sleep for tracking purposes (like I input what time I go to bed, what time I fall asleep and what time I get up in the AM and the app calculates my total sleep hours).","title":"Fabulous app for all types of diabetes","userName":"Doberman_Warrior"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7474801969","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-06-17T13:29:59Z","rating":5,"review":"I’ve been looking for an app like this for a long time. I had one similar a few years ago but for some reason they discontinued it. The best thing I can say is not only how easy it is to use but that it gives you a A1C average. I won’t know how accurate (close) it is until I go to the dr in late July for my Diabeties (type 2)check up.\nI really like the way it shows your daily average \u0026 the whole screen layout so you can see everything at once. I wish there was a way to put in order the items that you chose when you record your readings like before meals, after meals etc. I would like to arrange them in the order of importance to me \u0026 all the other items that I don’t use or don’t use much  I could move to the end.\nAlso when I record what I eat if there were some way of bringing up something you had recorded before ( I eat out a lot because of traveling so I’m stuck basically eating the same things because I know how that food affects my blood sugar).

I have been tracking what I eat for about the same time in MyFitnessPal. This app pulls it all together.  I still record my BG in iGluco because it comes to mySugr automatically. Without MyFitnessPal I would not know how many carbs I eating so I still must use it but the Carbs don’t come automatically. I sent that suggestion to support and they responded with a yes. \n\nSince the BG comes from iGluco years of data were imported day 1 and I was rewarded with an estimated A1C day 1 that was exactly the same as my two week old laboratory exam. \n\nThe reports and the motivation that come from this app made it something I knew that I never want to live without and paid my money in the first week. When I took my reports to my doctor he said this is very important. Always bring the last two weeks with you when you come. Well done guys keep developing. Import more nutrition data, and add it to the reports. Those reports save and extend lives.

So I was just diagnosed 3 months ago as having diabetes.  My A1C was in the 10.9 range at the time.  I found this app just days after and began tracking my levels very frequently and regularly.  With the information I was able to adjust according. I added a daily 45 minute workout. (Never did before) and within 3 months my A1C was 5.4.  My doctor was amazed and wants to share this app with others.  He recommended I continue to track frequently and maintain what I am doing. He also decreased my medication and may take me off meds altogether.

I love that it integrates with my Apple Health so it automatically shows how much I’ve exercised, the steps I’ve taken, and even confirms my glucose readings as my Contour Next app also integrates with Apple Health. The automatically generated reports allow me to easily keep my midwife updated on my readings. My one and only complaint and the only reason I’m docking a star is this: why can’t I see my scheduled reminders and update them? Once you input a meal the app allows you to set a reminder. However, once it’s set it does not display that you’ve even set one anywhere within the app or allow you to edit it. I’d also love to be able to set a daily reoccurring timer within this app for my supplements and medication since I also track it here, but there’s none to be found.

Of course the App Store doesn’t lack for applications and I downloaded nearly a dozen before settling on mySugr. \n\nMany asked for a lot of personal information with little guarantee of data protection. Others didn’t have enough options for data tracking. Some where simply ugly and unintuitive.

I learned that with more knowledge came more control and an interest in a diabetic diet and lifestyle changes that have helped me noticeably lose weight. I can’t wait to see what my next A1C is. I’m sure it’s going to be a lot better. Oh I forgot. With the bundle comes a Diabetic Educator right in the app. Well worth the 49 dollar investment each month.

Stop annoying me with that thing. 2) The developer team could really use some help from people skilled at data visualization. The visualizations aside from the color coded entries are useless.  Add better graphs. 3) Add the ability to customize the tag tiles. And why the hell is menstruation on there?  The app knows I’m male. Spend a little time having the app respond better to user data. 4) Get rid of the advertisement on the report in the paid version.  And make it easier to get to the reports. 5) Take advantage of the fact that everyone with an iPhone expect visualizations to be better and more detailed when we rotate the phone.
