        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Original Review: This year they dropped support for ps3 and Xbox 360. Due to this I was given the opportunity to experience how terrible using the app to watch a replay is. No period start selection. Absolutely garbage scrubbing controls. The -10 sec button often reverts back to the beginning of the game. The one positive is the streaming feed has less jumps and quality drops than the console apps had during live games.<br /><br />Almost forgot the constant notifications telling you if you want to see the notification content to turn off “hide scores”. How about not sending score notifications instead when hide scores is set?<br /><br />Update: The casting video player is fantastic. 10 second buttons have been replaced with 30 second buttons that actually work. The slider is much smoother and loads the video perfectly and at the correct time that is showing when you lift your finger up. Would still love to see the addition of the period start selection and ceasing score notifications when scores are turned off but I’m very happy with the recent changes.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I use this app a lot to stream games because Xfinity is way too expensive and the games aren’t in HD... But if there was any other reliable options to watch I’d probably go with that. The NHL app works half of the time which is why I gave it three stars and no more. When the app works it’s awesome, 95% of the time the stream is clear and the other 5% is just because of our internet so I can’t blame them on that. I love how it’s set up where you can see standings, League news and news about your single team! BUT... And this is a big but, IT CRASHES HALF THE TIME, I’ll think to myself, “HMMM I wonder what the scores are tonight” and these are the three things that happen... It either just won’t load, the app will load and you’ll see the home screen for a second and then it’ll crash OR when I press to see the scores it crashes. I don’t mind having to google scores but isn’t the point of the app to make it easier on the users to have info and entertainment easily accessible? Also like 15% of the time when we try to stream it’ll say we’re streaming the game but it’ll just show the two team logos and the NHL shield in the middle and will do nothing... Again when the app works it’s great but I find it not working A LOT</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have seen NHL players fight for social causes and I have seen them express their pain and their empathy for communities of ALL backgrounds.  But I have never seen them interrupt games or disrespect our national anthem.  They are the only professional sport who plays in front of their fans and does not force personal political views on people who spend good money to watch their favorite teams play.  I support every one of their causes no matter what, and I know they support positive energy from their fans bc this league comes to play, and win.  All of that deserves 5 stars on itself BUT this app is also very user friendly and informative especially for my home team when I am out on the road.  Thank you NHL for keeping it sports and thank you to the developers who make this app possible.  The behavior of the league and teams makes it really easy for me to choose the only sports app I will carry on my phone and the app makes it super friendly and easy for me to keep!!  #NHL #GoAvsGo!!!</p>

Due to this I was given the opportunity to experience how terrible using the app to watch a replay is. No period start selection. Absolutely garbage scrubbing controls. The -10 sec button often reverts back to the beginning of the game. The one positive is the streaming feed has less jumps and quality drops than the console apps had during live games.\n\nAlmost forgot the constant notifications telling you if you want to see the notification content to turn off “hide scores”. How about not sending score notifications instead when hide scores is set?\n\nUpdate: The casting video player is fantastic. 10 second buttons have been replaced with 30 second buttons that actually work. The slider is much smoother and loads the video perfectly and at the correct time that is showing when you lift your finger up. Would still love to see the addition of the period start selection and ceasing score notifications when scores are turned off but I’m very happy with the recent changes.","title":"Drastic improvements","userName":"Finn MacCooler"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4292497717","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-06-10T02:29:17Z","rating":3,"review":"I use this app a lot to stream games because Xfinity is way too expensive and the games aren’t in HD... But if there was any other reliable options to watch I’d probably go with that. The NHL app works half of the time which is why I gave it three stars and no more. When the app works it’s awesome, 95% of the time the stream is clear and the other 5% is just because of our internet so I can’t blame them on that. I love how it’s set up where you can see standings, League news and news about your single team! BUT... And this is a big but, IT CRASHES HALF THE TIME, I’ll think to myself, “HMMM I wonder what the scores are tonight” and these are the three things that happen... It either just won’t load, the app will load and you’ll see the home screen for a second and then it’ll crash OR when I press to see the scores it crashes. I don’t mind having to google scores but isn’t the point of the app to make it easier on the users to have info and entertainment easily accessible? Also like 15% of the time when we try to stream it’ll say we’re streaming the game but it’ll just show the two team logos and the NHL shield in the middle and will do nothing...

Also, if I do stream to a device from my phone, it will crash when I’m done and I will have to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work again, which means I have to log in, select my settings and preferences again.\n\nAll in all, it is a great app for articles (even if you have to keep going back to them), videos (as long as your not streaming them) and general use. Highly recommend using the app on any other device than mobile to utilize any video feature.","title":"Decent App but Faulty","userName":"Carterman19"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"8002473436","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-11-08T15:36:01Z","rating":5,"review":"To start off, I love all American sports, Like Basketball, Football, Baseball, and, of course, Hockey. I have the NBA app, NFL app, MLB app, and this NHL app. Of all of these, I can safely say that NHL has got my favroite set-up. It's easy to use and really worth it if you're a fan of Hockey. What I don't like is that you can't watch Hockey in the app, you need either Bally Sports for your location, or ESPN+. I do like how they post a 4-10 minute video about all of the goals scored the previous day, and I like the standings section. Another feature I like is that it allows you to customize the Icon you have for the app. You can either have a certian team or the NHL Logo. It's really cool and easy to change.\n\nOverall I say get this app, it's good, easy to use, and really helpful for keeping up with scores and the \"Gameflow\" Feature is nice, too. Thanks for reading! Have a nice day.","title":"Read this, it will take 2 minutes.","userName":"Roblox_Noobalistic"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3894842901","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-03-18T00:53:27Z","rating":4,"review":"I have been a long time flyers fan and I downloaded this app to follow the team better. It allows me to do so by notifying me about scores and news articles, but there are some flaws. For example the “free games” on nhl premium (which is a scam anyway) are not free for everyone. Also, sometimes when I open the app while game is going on, it gives me a notification that I can watch a game live on NHL premium. However I CANNOT ACCESS ANYTHING ON THE APP until I click on the notification which sends me to a page to buy a subscription to NHL premium. It’s fine if it’s a one time glitch, but it is every time. There are also some smaller things, like how stats don’t include hit leaders, but the radio feature is nice and overall it is very customizable. So 4 stars, it could be better but it does its job","title":"It’s a Solid App...

They give you a warning that you’re at the mercy of blackout restrictions. Okay, I won’t be able to watch EVERY game, that’s fine.  I bought a subscription and immediately canceled (literally within minutes of the purchase) because the game I wanted to watch was blacked out, despite the notifications that if I got NHL premium I could be watching the game live. So I’m stuck with it for a month. All the games I’ve tried to watch so far, except for one, so that’s 1 out of 13 games that have been blacked out. What am I even paying for? \nAnd of course, every game gives me a notification every period to watch the action live on NHL premium. Every time it pops up it just angers me more. Especially when I know it’s a lie.  Here’s an idea, don’t send out notifications that you could be watching the game live with premium if the game is backed out and you can’t actually be watching it live with premium.","title":"Don’t buy into premium","userName":"everythingiwantisalreadytaken"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4847300594","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-09-27T16:53:58Z","rating":3,"review":"Love this for game and news updates on my favorite teams and players (much better than the ESPN app), however the clunkiness of some features while in-app leave me frustrated. I'm no tech expert but I think it's just a lack of a little \"polish\". \n\nMight sound nit-picky but main reason for me only giving three stars is the video player. If the app is going to notify me about all these awesome videos to watch, then I feel the video player should be capable of showing them. More often than not I'm sitting, starting at a black screen, waiting for an ad to play, then again staring at a black screen, waiting for the video. There's so many apps out there capable of playing videos quickly and easily, why can't the NHL app do the same? I know it's not an issue of my cellular service.

If you enjoy watching NHL hockey with Vaseline on aquarium glass quality video and Circe 1970’s AM radio quality audio, then this is the app for you. It does not matter if I am streaming via 200+ Mbps WiFi, a FIOS line, or 4G/LTE, the quality of the games is awful. Come on NHL, your customers are blasting you on the reviews and you fix nothing. Get your head out of your apps and come into the 21st century.\n\nUpdate: this latest version reversed the update to the standings layout. You were showing the same data as the desktop site, Streak, L10, etc. Why would you go back to the previous version with less info?  NHL, this combined with your streaming issues is driving me nuts. I guess working on tech that already was a fan failure (going back to the puck tracker failure from last decade) and a player tracker so games look like a NASCAR race is more important that quality video streaming and a stable app. Get it together.","title":"Crystal clear...commercials","userName":"BGBrix3"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6920791478","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-01-27T19:57:51Z","rating":2,"review":"As others have said, premium is a joke. They are very deceiving with advertising what you get with premium. When I first downloaded the app I tried watching the game. I was prompted with a pop up that said in order to watch games LIVE I needed to upgrade to premium. I thought $20 a year was a good deal so I purchased. Then later when I tried watching the game, I watched two ads, then was prompted with another pop up saying I don’t have the right subscription and I needed NHL TV in order to watch which is $25 a month. Very deceiving and I’m not even sure why premium is a thing, other than to get people to spend $20. Spent hours trying to get a refund and NHL support just deferred me to Apple to get refunded. Rating 2 stars instead of 1 because the app itself works and looks great. The NHL folks really need to work on what they’re promoting because sneaky fine print ads are a good way to turn customers off.","title":"DO NOT BUY
