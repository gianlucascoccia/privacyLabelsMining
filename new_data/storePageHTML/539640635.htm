        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I can’t say enough good things about the above-average level of support I received from Unlisted when I was researching different options for a business line. <br />Unlisted made the originally frustrating process of trying and picking this kind of service much less frustrating by providing what I needed in a budget-friendly, easy-to-use, and aesthetically pleasing interface. 🙂<br />I chose Unlisted because of the quality of the service and support, and the price-points and features compared to similar providers.<br />I’m very satisfied with the service, I’m so happy I found it, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Unlisted!</p>

    Nice, but audio stop working

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Seems great, so I gave it a shot. First call, couldn’t hear the audio dropped 60 seconds into the call. Call did not drop, no it kept going. They get great reception at home so it wasn’t on their end. But I couldn’t hear the person I was talking to. Called them back from my real number, was fine, so I know the app was at fault. Next two calls were fine. Fourth call, left a message. That person called me back saying the audio cut out after 60 seconds but the message kept recording. He wanted to know what the rest of the message was, but was also afraid something had happened to me since I seemingly had stopped talking mid sentence. Fifth call, shorted out, after 60 seconds. Called back, it worked. So when it works, it’s great. But it’s crap 60% of the time. My phone never drops calls or has audio issues. But this app sure does. Worst part is, if I leave a message, no way of knowing if this app shorted out and the person didn’t get it. Stupid. Unless they fix it, just use *67.</p>

What you described is not normal and I would like to get some more information from you so that we can fix this. We have some theories about what might have gone wrong but would like to make sure. Could you please send us an email at support@unlisted-app.com so we can talk directly? Unfortunately these App Store reviews are anonymous so I cannot reach out directly.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve tried all of these 2nd Line phone &amp; text apps. This is by far the cleanest &amp; smoothest and most importantly easy to navigate with no complications. I’ve been so impressed that I’m telling friends about Unlisted! This is intuitive and clean and just employs a no nonsense approach to everything you expect from an app like this! It’s very affordable and provides lots of convenient options. And no constant advertisements! I can’t wait to use this for all my communication all while providing a wall to protect my privacy. Thanks Unlisted I’m 100% on board with your App!</p>

Call did not drop, no it kept going. They get great reception at home so it wasn’t on their end. But I couldn’t hear the person I was talking to. Called them back from my real number, was fine, so I know the app was at fault. Next two calls were fine. Fourth call, left a message. That person called me back saying the audio cut out after 60 seconds but the message kept recording. He wanted to know what the rest of the message was, but was also afraid something had happened to me since I seemingly had stopped talking mid sentence. Fifth call, shorted out, after 60 seconds. Called back, it worked. So when it works, it’s great. But it’s crap 60% of the time. My phone never drops calls or has audio issues. But this app sure does. Worst part is, if I leave a message, no way of knowing if this app shorted out and the person didn’t get it. Stupid. Unless they fix it, just use *67.","title":"Nice, but audio stop working","userName":"Mikron88"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7249098797","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-04-22T00:54:49Z","rating":5,"review":"I’ve tried all of these 2nd Line phone \u0026 text apps.
