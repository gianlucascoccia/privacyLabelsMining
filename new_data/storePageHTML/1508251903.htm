        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I downloaded this game after seeing the ads for awhile and I’m not usually someone who plays any kind of phone game, but I like this one a lot. There isn’t a very in depth explanation to how to do anything and there’s a lot of systems I don’t really understand or know why they exist but nothing is hard to do so it doesn’t bother me much. When I first started playing it I noticed that they have a currency called ingots that can be bought with real currency and used to speed along tasks and buy new outfits which is par for the course on any mobile game like this. I was pleasantly surprised however to learn that you actually collect a fair amount of them just by logging in and doing all the little tasks every day. It definitely takes time but it’s not a very long time and it’s not hard at all, so I’d say that’s a definite positive. It’s a fun game to take up a little bit of time everyday and the story does seem completely ludicrous at times and kind of jumps around but it’s still fun to read along with. There is however one glaring issue and that is that anytime during the day that the majority of people are awake the game is hellishly laggy. There’s a lag on every action you do and it’s honestly too frustrating and slow to do anything. Overall I’d say it’s a fun little tappy game, if you can play when there’s no lag.</p>

    Suggestions for Gameplay

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Just starting by saying I’ve definitely spent too much money on this game, but it remains one of the only mobile games that I don’t instantly regret throwing coins at so I’ll probably continue to do so. <br /><br />I do have some suggestions for improvements however. They mostly involve the dress-up feature, since that is my favorite part. <br /><br />1. An toggle that allows you to tuck the shirt layer under the skirt layer or not. There are skirts like the “white plum long skirt” that have very pretty details around the waist that you cannot see at all unless you wear a crop top with them, and tighter shirts that do not layer properly over flared out skirts.<br /><br />2. A way to either trade items to other players or exchange them for silver, ingots, cloud brocade, or other measures of in-game currency. I have 400+ banquet tokens and I keep getting more every time I do the daily tasks- I’m never going to host that many banquets. <br /><br />3. A wishlist of sorts. A place you can save items you wish to purchase for later, or a way to “save” outfits that have pieces you do not own yet. <br /><br />And a minor irritation: most of the necklaces do not sit properly on the character model. Only a few of them are at the proper angle- the rest sit crookedly and make the outfit look less polished.</p>

    (Updated)Good but has some flaws

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I downloaded this game after seeing an ad for it and I actually started to enjoy it after the first day. Today, I was logged out of my account and cannot remember the password for the life of me and there is no option to even change the password, which I think should be a thing. I tried to go to support on the app itself but it is entirely in Chinese, which is very unhelpful for someone who doesn’t read or speak the language. And my only other complaint would be that some of the outfits have an uncanny resemblance to ones in another Chinese game, Love Nikki. Overall, I really enjoy the storyline, even with the translation errors, and it isn’t too p2p which is another good thing. I just really wish this could get improved a little bit in the near future.<br />Update: I gave it five stars because even though it has clearly copied Love Nikki with a couple of dresses, I was able to contact support regarding my password. I started off using a translator for everything but eventually told them that I speak English, and they started responding to me in English. They were extremely helpful (unlike LN support) and I was able to get my password and sign back into my account. So very appreciative of this game’s support team.</p>

There isn’t a very in depth explanation to how to do anything and there’s a lot of systems I don’t really understand or know why they exist but nothing is hard to do so it doesn’t bother me much. When I first started playing it I noticed that they have a currency called ingots that can be bought with real currency and used to speed along tasks and buy new outfits which is par for the course on any mobile game like this. I was pleasantly surprised however to learn that you actually collect a fair amount of them just by logging in and doing all the little tasks every day. It definitely takes time but it’s not a very long time and it’s not hard at all, so I’d say that’s a definite positive. It’s a fun game to take up a little bit of time everyday and the story does seem completely ludicrous at times and kind of jumps around but it’s still fun to read along with. There is however one glaring issue and that is that anytime during the day that the majority of people are awake the game is hellishly laggy. There’s a lag on every action you do and it’s honestly too frustrating and slow to do anything. Overall I’d say it’s a fun little tappy game, if you can play when there’s no lag.","title":"Good game.","userName":"RissunChan"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7956223820","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-10-26T15:32:24Z","rating":4,"review":"Just starting by saying I’ve definitely spent too much money on this game, but it remains one of the only mobile games that I don’t instantly regret throwing coins at so I’ll probably continue to do so. \n\nI do have some suggestions for improvements however. They mostly involve the dress-up feature, since that is my favorite part. \n\n1. An toggle that allows you to tuck the shirt layer under the skirt layer or not. There are skirts like the “white plum long skirt” that have very pretty details around the waist that you cannot see at all unless you wear a crop top with them, and tighter shirts that do not layer properly over flared out skirts.\n\n2. A way to either trade items to other players or exchange them for silver, ingots, cloud brocade, or other measures of in-game currency. I have 400+ banquet tokens and I keep getting more every time I do the daily tasks- I’m never going to host that many banquets. \n\n3. A wishlist of sorts. A place you can save items you wish to purchase for later, or a way to “save” outfits that have pieces you do not own yet. \n\nAnd a minor irritation: most of the necklaces do not sit properly on the character model. Only a few of them are at the proper angle- the rest sit crookedly and make the outfit look less polished.","title":"Suggestions for Gameplay","userName":"Wwehphone"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6073219511","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-14T03:55:24Z","rating":5,"review":"I downloaded this game after seeing an ad for it and I actually started to enjoy it after the first day. Today, I was logged out of my account and cannot remember the password for the life of me and there is no option to even change the password, which I think should be a thing. I tried to go to support on the app itself but it is entirely in Chinese, which is very unhelpful for someone who doesn’t read or speak the language. And my only other complaint would be that some of the outfits have an uncanny resemblance to ones in another Chinese game, Love Nikki. Overall, I really enjoy the storyline, even with the translation errors, and it isn’t too p2p which is another good thing. I just really wish this could get improved a little bit in the near future.\nUpdate: I gave it five stars because even though it has clearly copied Love Nikki with a couple of dresses, I was able to contact support regarding my password. I started off using a translator for everything but eventually told them that I speak English, and they started responding to me in English. They were extremely helpful (unlike LN support) and I was able to get my password and sign back into my account. So very appreciative of this game’s support team.","title":"(Updated)Good but has some flaws","userName":"randomstrangerontheinternet:p"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6108654714","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-22T15:02:21Z","rating":5,"review":"I’ve left a review here before and I still love this game! Great community and pleasant people playing. No nasty comments or people from the game. But, we were hoping that the game developers could include in the next update a silver to gold ingot exchange? And a silver to cloud brocade? \n\nIt could some by asking for a high silver price in exchange for the gold and brocade. Just so that the players who couldn’t pay can still have a chance to buy some outfits since this is a dress up game. \n\nMost of the new players get stuck and can only get random pieces of outfits that they don’t even personally like. That’s why we see them leave the game. If it was made possible then more players would stay on each server. Keeping the competition up! \n\nYou wouldn’t really have to worry about loss of revenue since people will still pay to play! I will always get impatient and pay in game for ingots and there are plenty more like me out there! But the rest are either unemployed without steady income, students, or just kids still! Honestly if you can do the silver to ingots/cloud brocade exchange you’d probably see more people play and continue to play for a long time. Overtime you’ll get steady incoming payments from these players! Once people play long enough, they feel dedicated to their characters and will want to continue competing for a spot on the rankings. App purchases will still go on then. \n\nPlease LOP developers!! CREATE A SILVER TO GOLD INGOTS/CLOUD BROCADE EXCHANGE.","title":"SUGGESTIONS~","userName":"Su Nan Nan"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7340211040","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-05-15T04:15:31Z","developerResponse":{"id":22756382,"body":"Hello,if you select quick play when you started, check if you have saved your account details in your device's gallery.

I’ve been playing for awhile now, off and on. The outfits are beautiful, the storyline ranges from hilarious to heartfelt to suspenseful, and there is an almost never ending list of things to do. That being said, it also has its downfalls. For people who don’t play religiously or spend a lot of money on the app, it’s difficult to level up. Others have suggested resources-to-ingots trades, and I think that would be super beneficial, even if it was limited to a certain amount each day. Two other issues with gameplay that come up often for me:……….. 1. Why is there not a fast fight option for every fight involving parters?! Example: Razors Edge. 2. I need a “Do not show this message again” option on every reminder in the game. I can select it on purchases, but not on Rare Beats Hunt crackdowns messages?………….. All in all, thanks for a good game, and if these two issues are fixed, I’ll even update to 5 stars.","title":"Love it, but needs improvement.","userName":"Kyrsten A"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6020987214","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-01T08:44:48Z","rating":5,"review":"Honestly, though this game does take some getting used to, once you get the gist of everything it's actually pretty interesting to play. You are actually given a reasonable amount of currency, and its really easy to gain more. Unlike some frustrating romance games (that give very little currency and very little interaction in the chapter), this game allows much better character interactions.\n\nOne thing that might deter people who just started playing are all the options that pop out and somewhat unclear instructions; however, if you continue playing, it's easy to figure out what the controls are and how to play the game. Just click some buttons and collect the items; and don't worry too much about spending currency, because it's fairly easy to replenish your supply.","title":"Pretty good","userName":"Flying squirrel glider"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6287019302","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-08-06T13:57:47Z","developerResponse":{"id":16658819,"body":"Hello, can you kindly send us an email at cs@modo.cn so that we can assist you in getting your account back?

There are competitions for titles multiple times a week but only players that pay actually win. Top players are all paid players. So if you don’t intend to spend much money you will not win the title or place in top 50. They also have side games that require you to buy tokens to play and win rewards that you essentially pay for anyways. Unless you’re already at the top, getting there without paying will take you forever. Basically, it’s a pay to play game - you’re paying about $40 to buy special packages to help boost your points towards a title. An out lift for your character will cost you about $100 (~60 cloud brocades (token for clothes) which costs about 6,000 ingots (game money) or $100). \n\nOther than that the game is esthetically pleasing and the whole process of upgrading your characters is addictively satisfying.","title":"Fun for players with $$$$$$","userName":"nlui511"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6255837995","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-29T15:04:42Z","developerResponse":{"id":16965295,"body":"Hello, thank you for your feedback.
