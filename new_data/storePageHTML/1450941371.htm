        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This game takes the sandbox Genre into a whole new level between how beautiful the game is and the way that everything in racks you can definitely tell there’s a lot of time put into this app I’ve played several if not all of the other sand box games in the App Store and none of them really compared to the amount of satisfaction of this game gives youThere’s so many different things that you could potentially do between building civilizations just to watch some crumble or even setting up a 4 way rumble between races to see who would win and so many other things from turning all populations in the zombies making a thrive in civilization the options are so vast and with the right additions this game shouLd be on pc and console <br /><br />But...if there were things I would ask for would maybe be the option to advanceCivilizations technologically wise you know like cars planes boats or even like horseback stuff like this would help bring the immersion factor into the game may even make it to where they can slowly after many many years evolved into modern cities along with military and police medical I know it sounds like a lot but from what you’ve done you pretty much made the steppingstones for the simple upgrade I have no doubt that these things will be able to be added especially with the creativity that the developer has shown  I think this could be the absolute best sand game ever add a few tweaks my dude your doing great so far .<br /><br />Thanks-</p>

    So my suggestions on what you could do.
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So this is a great game, I’ve been using it to have fun on developing stories and lore of my own to share to my friend and it’s been great. The game is very well done and the ad for it is clean. But here are a few issues, first an undo button would be really helpful since there have been many times where I either destroyed my world or terrain because I had the wrong brush selected. I say this because you can’t possibly expect players to go back and save. So another suggestion is make the save button more easily accessible. There is also problems in which I purified the crap out of my world of plagues but couldn’t locate the final two people with the plague so that got annoying. I also like to suggest maybe each race being able to develop  their own maybe siege weapons? And also maybe ad ship to ship combat or something like that (pirates as well). I also suggest adding more races as well, but I believe you guys are definitely  going to do that in the future. Other than that, solid fun and it’s great to casually chill and watch the creatures of my world live and exist. Man I felt conflicted whether to help humanity or not as I watched them get wiped out by the superiors races.<br /><br />One last thing I’d like to add, please do allow us to name our own worlds. I feel slightly disappointed in unable of being able to name my own world. There’s also the case of not being allowed to have to option to expand a world size or maybe decreasing it.</p>

    A cool idea
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This game has so far been really awesome and I can tell this game has the potential of having really cool things added to it. With the addition of boats this opens the door for awesome possibilities to come to the future but first I want to address an idea I came up with that would be cool for all aspects of the game. I know this idea I’m about to say will take a lot of time to make but I think would be overall really interesting and that is a learning system for the Ai. So for example a civilization is just created and at first they are really primitive and stupid but the more the people do the more the Ai learns so like say that civilization wants to attack another but a tactic isn’t working and they keep getting killed the Ai would think of an different plan of attack and maybe try a different angle, send more fighters, etc and the same idea can be implemented for a defensive stand point or really anything. After a lot of in game  years have passed that one civilization will be very smart and wise and a hard opponent to defeat. I came up with this idea when one civilization kept attacking the other but the defending civilization would destroy the Attacking then right after they did that they would swim across the channel and do the same tactic as their enemy and they kept doing that back and forth for so long and without my intervention it would’ve stayed like that. Just a thought for the future I’m sure you have your hands full but something to think about!</p>

The game is very well done and the ad for it is clean. But here are a few issues, first an undo button would be really helpful since there have been many times where I either destroyed my world or terrain because I had the wrong brush selected. I say this because you can’t possibly expect players to go back and save. So another suggestion is make the save button more easily accessible. There is also problems in which I purified the crap out of my world of plagues but couldn’t locate the final two people with the plague so that got annoying. I also like to suggest maybe each race being able to develop  their own maybe siege weapons? And also maybe ad ship to ship combat or something like that (pirates as well). I also suggest adding more races as well, but I believe you guys are definitely  going to do that in the future. Other than that, solid fun and it’s great to casually chill and watch the creatures of my world live and exist. Man I felt conflicted whether to help humanity or not as I watched them get wiped out by the superiors races.\n\nOne last thing I’d like to add, please do allow us to name our own worlds. I feel slightly disappointed in unable of being able to name my own world. There’s also the case of not being allowed to have to option to expand a world size or maybe decreasing it.","title":"So my suggestions on what you could do.","userName":"GodsOfDeath"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6731684227","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-12-08T20:07:29Z","developerResponse":{"id":19701161,"body":"Hello!

With the addition of boats this opens the door for awesome possibilities to come to the future but first I want to address an idea I came up with that would be cool for all aspects of the game. I know this idea I’m about to say will take a lot of time to make but I think would be overall really interesting and that is a learning system for the Ai. So for example a civilization is just created and at first they are really primitive and stupid but the more the people do the more the Ai learns so like say that civilization wants to attack another but a tactic isn’t working and they keep getting killed the Ai would think of an different plan of attack and maybe try a different angle, send more fighters, etc and the same idea can be implemented for a defensive stand point or really anything. After a lot of in game  years have passed that one civilization will be very smart and wise and a hard opponent to defeat. I came up with this idea when one civilization kept attacking the other but the defending civilization would destroy the Attacking then right after they did that they would swim across the channel and do the same tactic as their enemy and they kept doing that back and forth for so long and without my intervention it would’ve stayed like that. Just a thought for the future I’m sure you have your hands full but something to think about!","title":"A cool idea","userName":"Master chief 118"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7279213615","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-04-30T01:52:13Z","developerResponse":{"id":22572110,"body":"Thanks for detailed feedback!

It’s so cool to watch kingdoms from their humble beginnings build and expand. I’ve seen everything from empirical kingdoms taking over almost every other kingdom to a single dwarf breaking off to make his own village. A few things that I’d suggest after playing for a while is firstly making sea travel a lot easier. When kingdoms expand, they rarely get off of the island that they are on. If there were ships that carried groups of settlers to new islands to make villages, that would be so cool. Another point for sea travel is wars. It would be awesome to see, in time of war, kingdoms develop warships to have naval battles and carry troops to an opposing kingdoms to fight. A second thing I’d suggest is an alliance/trade system. Kingdoms often go to war at random times, but it would be cool to have kingdoms randomly make alliances that allowed them to trade resources between kingdoms and help allied kingdoms in a time of war. One third and final thing I’d like to see would be spawning animals. One that that would be great is if holding down would continually spawn animals. Trying to make a bunch of npcs to make a town can take a while when you’re just tapping. I’d also love to see some more animals like horses that maybe could be ridden for faster land transportation. \n\nThis is a really solid game and I rarely pay for a game, but this game really is worth it. I’m excited to see where this game goes in the future!!","title":"Absolutely love this game!","userName":"crabcrab30"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7252777494","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-04-23T00:20:49Z","developerResponse":{"id":22538504,"body":"Thanks for detailed feedback!

I love it, I play every day and watch kingdoms grow! When they reach their brink and cannot grow, I cast upon a mighty plague on them! I riddle them away and I have new people reinhabit the houses and buildings, either way I love it, if it’s the consistent updates, how you can literally play god, destroy worlds or create them, it’s amazing. I gotta say it really only needs two more things in my opinion! My kingdoms have trouble expanding their reign, say I put 7 humans on an island. They form a kingdom and a village. They make a dock farms and everything. But they don’t have room to expand. Ive had trouble having my people go to new islands and inhabit them, maybe add a new boat! An exploration boat! That has people to colonize new land! I really love world generation but I hate how people never move to new islands! So! Onto the second thing! Wars. Sometimes I get a world with two or three islands, I put a few people on each of them and start a three way war. It’s always a stale mate! They never sail to do naval invasions! One time I had a war between two kingdoms that lasted 1366 years! I got bored and blew up the world! Please make it so wars can be more interesting, especially between kingdoms that have great distance! \nOh! One more thing! Worlds feel so small, if you could please take the time to add a vertical mode on IPhone for bigger maps.\nWell this is goodbye!

One of those ideas would be to add walls around cities and certain towns. Giving a advanced vibe and creating a certain feel that this kingdom is more defended. Like a citadel, allowing for kingdoms to survive more and grow more. Another idea I had to counter walls is that it takes lots of resources to make them. They can also be broken by certain mages, or certain powers. Their main weakness can be a new unit that specializes in creating destruction. Which is a catapult unit. Alas there can be a new specialist building which units like soldiers to use, like horses, siege weapons, etc. my last idea is the ability for kingdoms to thrive in many environments with unique buildings. I noticed that if you start kingdoms in a desert or a wintery land, often times they don’t develop. Even when given resources they tend to just be stuck at stage 0. An optional idea to add in for the game is to allow weather conditions be automate, I know we have an option for that. But this option is to allow rain, even winter lands, or desert lands to have there own weather which only happens in there region. And to also maintain those lands as well. That’s all I had to write but thank you for creating this beautiful game. I hope you continue its legacy and development of it.","title":"Some recommendations for more fun.","userName":"CM APOLLO"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7064372512","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-03-04T14:45:21Z","developerResponse":{"id":21626703,"body":"Glad you like the game!

I think it would be a perfect game to put on Steam, virtually everyone has a pc capable of running this. There are a few things though. For a free game this is awesome, and don’t do this for Mobile because it might not be able to handle it. Try to add more room for the player to build empires, Civilizations, and allow the humans to use explosives on there own in a war for the bigger worlds. Give people the ability to chose the size of there world, and if they’re wanna cut explosives off from being used by Humans give them that choose. Also, allow them to chose there pre generated world, or to not chose one, and to have a blank map. Also on pc add ray tracing support if possible (would be cool, but don’t have to), and allow the player to chose there frame rate, graphics level, and resolution. Also, allow people to use save slots to save there worlds. Last I would like it if you put the game on consoles so I could play on my big living room tv. If you did all this I’d pay $10 for the game. As long as it included the pack your selling for $8. If you add any contact after that, like skins, extra abilities I’d pay for that via micro transactions. If the game gets big enough a multiplayer would be cool. So far I love the game, but you should add these things. 8/10 game currently. This would put it at a 9/10.

It’s so entertaining to create worlds and destroy them, as well as giving life to many creatures. A key feature that would get me to give that last star would be boats. That would make this perfect. A few ideas to make the game even more enjoyable would be to add more races. For example, merfolk would set up buildings in oceans, can swim faster and attack in water, and can only last for a limited amount of time on land. The current races are great, but after a while they get boring. I think having more races with different attributes would make the game more interesting and give it a better replay value. Another thing that would be cool to add are more disasters. One example is a hurricane which could be a buffed up version of the tornado. It would be able to throw buildings rather than just destroy them for even more destruction. The last idea I have for a feature is more controlled monsters. One monster can be a controllable dragon or some other flying monster. Another could be a leviathan that swims in the water and jumps out to cause destruction. Those are just my takes though. Otherwise it’s an awesome game with tons to do! The very last thing I’d like to say is......   please add dogs. They could be tame able by humans and would have stats and a name when named. (I am aware that the devs and other people have come up with these ideas. I just wanted to show my examples and ideas of these potential features)","title":"Amazing game!

It has awesome features that no other game in the genre has. However, if it's possible, I'd love to see more things added to this game. Mainly just more powers/creatures/ect. I'd also love to see the whole colony system expanded on. Maybe add more features to that aspect specifically. Maybe some Heroes live in the colonies who go out and adventure or something. Animals should be able to breed so that you don't have a limited supply and have to spawn more of them. Also, it'd be cool to see some kind of automated spawner for hostile mobs. And maybe those hostile mobs also make little civilizations of their own, just to add another enemy for the races to fight. Imagine being able to spawn dragon eggs that start out as baby dragons who simply hunt for food, giving time for the humans to build up their defenses against the inevitable dragon attack as they grow and breed. It'd be cool if the humans could tame passive mobs like horses or dogs. Or for that matter, if they could tame dragons and fly around with them. Maybe nerf some of the hostile mobs so that spawning more than a few doesn't devestate an entire colony. \n\nAnyway, I understand the difficulty in making things like these so I'll cut this endless review short.
