        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Overall a great sounding streaming app!! Mostly every artist I searched for is on Deezer. Really simple to navigate. Gives you options to change sound quality for those who want to listen to music crystal clear or you can custom setup if you are using cellular data to a few setting that won’t use as much data. Good options for everyone really. Ok I have only one thing they could change but it’s just my opinion. I love dark mode! So if Deezer could add the option for dark mode for there general interface. It’s not bright white all the time tho. It does have nice colors on the song that you play that match the album cover in a nice way. I’m sure they are working on dark mode for IOS 13 anyways. So nothing really to complain about. The app works great and oh yeah, I like the flow setting too. Thanks Deez!!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I got a free trial to use this app back in August and very quickly realized it doesn’t come close to Apple Music so I deleted the App. Before doing so I made sure to check my subscriptions to make sure my free trial doesn’t turn into a paid one, but I didn’t see anything so I thought I was all good. After months of having the App deleted I find out I’m somehow getting charged for this. I message customer support cause this cheap company doesn’t even have a phone service and they tell me they can’t do anything to refund me. They tell me I should’ve known to go to my Deezer account to cancel my subscription. I’m a college student who has been laid off from work facing a financial nightmare during this pandemic and they simply don’t care. THEY SIMPLY DON’T CARE!! If a company doesn’t show sympathy in a time like this they’re simply MONSTERS. Thank you for taking money from a financially struggling student. Update, I spoke to customer service again after receiving a comment to my review that they care. They only refunded me one month. ONE MONTH! I’m sure they can check my account usage and see I haven’t touched the service since August but they only care enough for one month. Stay away from this MONEY HUNGRY APP, they don’t believe in customer service. I hope the money you stole from me was worth it! It would be nice to be able to speak to a higher up.</p>

    One Huge Design Flaw
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Since the demise of Google Play Music, we’ve been shopping around for a good music player app. Deezer has come highly recommended, but there’s one design flaw that I just can’t get around. I am home full time and like to stream my music to my TV or other player. When it finishes playing my selected album, it starts playing other, random music from the same or similar artists. Even if I set the album to repeat, it STILL plays other music and albums. I want it to stop playing all together over choosing music for me. If I want a radio station inspired by a specific artist, I’ll use Pandora. Because I am currently using a variety of players right now, I’ve also noticed Deezer is less intuitive than other platforms at finding music based on my search credentials. For example, if I want to listen to Christmas music from a certain artist, it will only bring up albums that specifically have “Christmas” in the album title, not all of their holiday music. Just today I wanted to listen to an album called “Christmastime” by Michael W Smith. I typed “Michael W Smith Christmas” in the search field and it wouldn’t bring up the album 🤷🏻‍♀️ I had to go through his albums to find it.</p>

The DEEZER Content is protected by applicable laws, including intellectual property laws. You may only access and use the DEEZER Content for the purpose of using the Deezer Service in accordance with these Terms of Service.\n\nAny unauthorized use of the Application, the Deezer Service or the DEEZER Content without the express consent of DEEZER is strictly forbidden.

Otherwise, the new terms will take effect after thirty (30) days.\n\nArticle 15 – Contact DEEZER\n\nFor any information or question regarding the Deezer Service, you can contact DEEZER by submitting a request at http://support.deezer.com.\n\nArticle 16 – Nullity of a term\n\nYou and DEEZER agree that if any portion of these Terms of Service or of the DEEZER Privacy Policy is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.\n\nArticle 17 – Choice of Law\n\nThese Terms of Service are governed by the laws of the state of New York, without regard to conflict of law principles, and the parties irrevocably consent to bring any action to enforce this Agreement in the federal or state courts located in New York. You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York County, New York.\n\nArticle 18 – Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Class Remedies\n\nThe parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service (including its formation, performance and breach) and your use of the Deezer Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the AAA, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nThe parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\n\nThe parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.\n\nYou have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth this section by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out here. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of registering to use the Deezer Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms set forth above. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them. In addition, if you elect to opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we may terminate your use of the Service.\n\nArticle 19 – Assignment\n\nDEEZER may assign or delegate these Terms of Service and/or the DEEZER Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy without DEEZER’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void and ineffective.\n\nArticle 20 – Entire Agreement\n\nThese Terms of Service, any supplemental policies and any documents expressly incorporated by reference herein (including DEEZER’s Privacy Policy), contain the entire understanding of you and DEEZER, and supersede all prior understandings of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof, whether electronic, oral or written, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, between you and DEEZER with respect to the Deezer Service.\n\nArticle 21 – No Waiver\n\nThe failure of DEEZER to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms of Service or the DEEZER Privacy Policy or failure to exercise any right under them shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of DEEZER’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.\n\nThe express waiver by DEEZER of any provision, condition, or requirement of these Terms of Service or the DEEZER Privacy Policy shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.\n\nExcept as expressly and specifically set forth in these Terms of Service, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by DEEZER shall be deemed a modification of these Terms of Service nor be legally binding, unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed officer of DEEZER.","is32bitOnly":false,"isStandaloneWithCompanionForWatchOS":false,"seller":"DEEZER

Mostly every artist I searched for is on Deezer. Really simple to navigate. Gives you options to change sound quality for those who want to listen to music crystal clear or you can custom setup if you are using cellular data to a few setting that won’t use as much data. Good options for everyone really. Ok I have only one thing they could change but it’s just my opinion. I love dark mode! So if Deezer could add the option for dark mode for there general interface. It’s not bright white all the time tho. It does have nice colors on the song that you play that match the album cover in a nice way. I’m sure they are working on dark mode for IOS 13 anyways. So nothing really to complain about. The app works great and oh yeah, I like the flow setting too.

After months of having the App deleted I find out I’m somehow getting charged for this. I message customer support cause this cheap company doesn’t even have a phone service and they tell me they can’t do anything to refund me. They tell me I should’ve known to go to my Deezer account to cancel my subscription. I’m a college student who has been laid off from work facing a financial nightmare during this pandemic and they simply don’t care. THEY SIMPLY DON’T CARE!! If a company doesn’t show sympathy in a time like this they’re simply MONSTERS. Thank you for taking money from a financially struggling student. Update, I spoke to customer service again after receiving a comment to my review that they care. They only refunded me one month. ONE MONTH! I’m sure they can check my account usage and see I haven’t touched the service since August but they only care enough for one month. Stay away from this MONEY HUNGRY APP, they don’t believe in customer service. I hope the money you stole from me was worth it!

I am home full time and like to stream my music to my TV or other player. When it finishes playing my selected album, it starts playing other, random music from the same or similar artists. Even if I set the album to repeat, it STILL plays other music and albums. I want it to stop playing all together over choosing music for me. If I want a radio station inspired by a specific artist, I’ll use Pandora. Because I am currently using a variety of players right now, I’ve also noticed Deezer is less intuitive than other platforms at finding music based on my search credentials. For example, if I want to listen to Christmas music from a certain artist, it will only bring up albums that specifically have “Christmas” in the album title, not all of their holiday music. Just today I wanted to listen to an album called “Christmastime” by Michael W Smith. I typed “Michael W Smith Christmas” in the search field and it wouldn’t bring up the album 🤷🏻‍♀️ I had to go through his albums to find it.","title":"One Huge Design Flaw","userName":"lpbennett"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6352794720","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-08-23T16:52:38Z","rating":5,"review":"Love everything about this app!!

The ads, app design and audio quality were the only things that were actually good about his app. AND when you want to listen to that certain song, and you don’t have enough “skips” then you simply can’t listen to it! You either listen to some song you’ve never heard before, or you listen to nothing. You need “premium” to listen to it. I know the app needs money, but it’s simply not very practical.
