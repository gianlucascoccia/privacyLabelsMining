        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I&#39;m a huge to-do list person &amp; I&#39;ve tried close to 100 to do &amp; task apps over the years (including premium subscriptions to all the big apps). Smart Tasks has been a refreshing godsend. The great advantage it gives its user is its combination of SIMPLICITY, continuous CROSS-DEVICE SYNC, its VISUALLY APPEALING interface (trust me, you&#39;ll love the range of colors, plus it&#39;s typology -- something so many To Do apps fail at), and its WIDGETS. Personally, I love being able to enter items on my Macbook, and then see it pop up as a widget, almost instantly, on my iphone in its nicely sized text that never fail to actually command my visual attention. Functionally, it&#39;s difficult to beat. It helps you to easily DIFFERENTIATE between specific TO DO TASKS, and REPEATED HABITS or ROUTINES (this has been huge for me). I&#39;m a huge fan of the different views I can get with just a tap or a click, all without feeling as if the workspace is CLUTTERED. I&#39;d encourage the Developers to continue with their vision. The app&#39;s concept is so intuitive that it alone separates it from many others on the market. The visual appeal &amp; easy user experience make it feel even more optimal. Keep up the excellent work!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have never left a review for an app before - this is my first. I am literally * obsessed * with this app. The way everything is so customizable, the ease of use, the grouping, the way it is so intuitive as to how you would make a to-do list on actual paper - I could go on. I am a to-do list freak and this checks all my boxes. I downloaded around 20 organizational apps and this one was far superior to all of the other ones. Not to mention, this app works with the Apple Pen seamlessly, whereas most of the other ones I&#39;ve tried are not really compatible or intuitive with the pen. 10/10 recommend - I am a customer for LIFE!! My only suggestion and request would be that once you “complete” an item and it goes to the completed items list, that the items are still categorized by day instead of just one big list. I have to fill out daily timesheets for work (but usually do at the end of the month) and it would be really helpful to be able to go back to the completed items list and see everything still categorized by day.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Well let me be the first to say that I’m a very compulsive organizer &amp; obsessive over time management. We’re talking 2 planners, daily reminders, &amp; lists on lists of more lists. 🥴 <br />I’m taking a pretty heavy course load this semester &amp; I work full time, like most of us do, &amp; the crazy organization is the only way that I can keep up with it all without falling behind. <br /><br />This app is a D R E A M if you’re someone like me (hopefully not as extreme because I’m not having a good time) or someone wanting to get organized.  <br />It’s very customizable &amp; has multiple options per task to make it what you need it to be. <br />For example: <br />I have each class broken up into a Task &amp; within it are all of my assignments, due dates, exam days, etc..<br />I also made a Task full of “routines” to help keep me on track with weekly studying &amp; reading. <br /><br />Super helpful is also the ability to look ahead at the next 7 days. <br />It gives a good look at what to expect in the coming days. <br /><br />I could really go on &amp; on, but I’ll finish up with saying that there’s something super satisfying about marking a task as complete &amp; watching it disappear off the list. Just as satisfying is seeing the completed list. <br /><br />Honestly just do it. Download it. You won’t regret it.</p>

Smart Tasks has been a refreshing godsend. The great advantage it gives its user is its combination of SIMPLICITY, continuous CROSS-DEVICE SYNC, its VISUALLY APPEALING interface (trust me, you'll love the range of colors, plus it's typology -- something so many To Do apps fail at), and its WIDGETS. Personally, I love being able to enter items on my Macbook, and then see it pop up as a widget, almost instantly, on my iphone in its nicely sized text that never fail to actually command my visual attention. Functionally, it's difficult to beat. It helps you to easily DIFFERENTIATE between specific TO DO TASKS, and REPEATED HABITS or ROUTINES (this has been huge for me). I'm a huge fan of the different views I can get with just a tap or a click, all without feeling as if the workspace is CLUTTERED. I'd encourage the Developers to continue with their vision. The app's concept is so intuitive that it alone separates it from many others on the market. The visual appeal \u0026 easy user experience make it feel even more optimal.

I am literally * obsessed * with this app. The way everything is so customizable, the ease of use, the grouping, the way it is so intuitive as to how you would make a to-do list on actual paper - I could go on. I am a to-do list freak and this checks all my boxes. I downloaded around 20 organizational apps and this one was far superior to all of the other ones. Not to mention, this app works with the Apple Pen seamlessly, whereas most of the other ones I've tried are not really compatible or intuitive with the pen. 10/10 recommend - I am a customer for LIFE!! My only suggestion and request would be that once you “complete” an item and it goes to the completed items list, that the items are still categorized by day instead of just one big list. I have to fill out daily timesheets for work (but usually do at the end of the month) and it would be really helpful to be able to go back to the completed items list and see everything still categorized by day.","title":"My Favorite app of ALL TIME","userName":"anlockar"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7720766080","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-08-22T06:33:10Z","developerResponse":{"id":24969211,"body":"Thank you for using Smart Tasks and your extremely kind words!

I love how I can have multiple lists, and be able to move to dos under certain days or whenever, and if I do the to do often I can just slide it to the next day I need to do it rather than click it off.  I also like being able to see my completed to dos when I go back through week by week to see my highlights of the week.  I had to turn the reminders app part off though because it drove me nuts that I could see the reminders, but that it does not work back and forth with the reminders app, such as bringing all my reminders in automatically for the days they fall on, but making it possible to click them off within this app and have them also be clicked off in the reminders app too.

I’ll drag and drop to arrange ordering of tasks on one device but when I go to another device it seems to re-sync and change the order again.
