        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>My previous experience with other financial memberships and supplemental income apps, especially ones that partner you with credit monitoring and repair services and income boosters have ended up being like hit or miss and overall underwhelming. Even though Steady had a better reputation than others I was still skeptical and assumed I’d run into issues like being matched with partner companies that oversell and underdeliver the perks of their services or I’d fail to receive a booster for some minor fine print issue that kept me from eligibility, however that hasn’t been the case. I wanted to open a new checking account and that was the main reason I even downloaded Steady and hadn’t planned on giving it too much thought after... but that changed quickly after realizing Steady was solid and simple and not seemingly using trickery.<br /><br />I went with the $75 for opening a Varo checking account (which I’m very happy with BTW) and I was cautioned that it could take up to 60 days for the booster to deposit.I applied and open the checking account by going through steady and I got a little worried because after I finalize that it didn’t take me back to Steady and I imagined I had screwed it up somehow... but I quickly got an email that I had activated it and  I received the $75 in my new account no more than a week after I spent the required $25 on my new debit card.  <br /><br />I hate that I felt cynical to the point that I was so surprised when Steady steadily delivered.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’m new to this app, but so far I am incredibly impressed! I believe it’s important to note that I am not being rewarded in any type of way to write this review; I’m doing it to provide feedback to users, &amp; the developers. With that being said however, I’ve had this app for less than 1 month, &amp; I have already received 2 rewards: the 1st one was a $10 e-Visa...&amp; I received it ~ via email ~ within 1 day after completing an ‘Income Booster,’ &amp; that timeframe is so super rare when it comes to being paid from online stores/apps. Since I’m so new tho, I still have lots of features that Steady offers that I just haven’t had the time or opportunity to complete just yet. I’ve been researching &amp; trying out numerous different apps that are the same concept as Steady, but none have come even close. And I’m just getting started....<br />I hope it only gets better from here!! I say this bcuz it’s common that when someone firsts signs up with an app, or a website such as a paid survey site, that rewards &amp; payment thresholds are easily met &amp; received...&amp; then when that person is no longer “new,” the rewards, the offers to complete surveys to earn points, etc., slow to the slowest crawl, if not ceasing altogether, as I’m sure most everyone who might be reading this review has experienced. So here’s to ‘Steady’ remaining at least consistent with what they’ve already demonstrated...&amp; to hoping that my experience only gets better!!!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I was uncertain whether to try the app or, frankly trust it. When you first open the app is displayed, at least for me, 3 apps on the App Store that you can freelance for and a signup section on bottom to receive more. I was pretty skeptical, especially because it wanted not only my zip, but on the next page, my name, email and phone number, something I never like to give out. I had a spam number gotten via google voice that has excellent filtering built in and can be easily turned off or removed, all for free (thanks google!) so I used that. But what I got was an amazing array of possibilities of work from home. They ask a quick survey to target your interest and desires for work, nothing personally identifiable, and two buttons. One is more info, though not a lot more than an unneeded summary anyway as the description gives most of the valid details, and the other button is the link to either the hiring page or the app on the App Store. And there’s a lot of content for that too. Apps I didn’t know of, businesses offering a malinials dream job (work on your own terms) online from home, and traditional jobs from big companies in my area.<br />For reference I’m a stay at home dad trying to find more income with 1 year old.</p>

In some cases, we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers.\r\n\r\nDevice Information: We may collect information about your mobile device, including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software and file names and versions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information.\r\n\r\nLog Information: When you interact with the Services, we collect server logs, which may include information like device IP address, access dates and times, geolocation information about where you might be, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and the third-party site or service you were using before interacting with our Services.  \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PLATFORM PERMISSIONS\r\nMost mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the Steady app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the Steady app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent.\r\n\r\nInformation We Collect from Other Sources\r\n\r\nWe may also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.

Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure, thus, despite these efforts, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted through our website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk.\r\n\r\nTo protect the security of your information, we may require you to authenticate your identity to conduct certain transactions using the Services. If you believe that information that you have submitted through the Services has been used without your permission, email us at help@steadyapp.com to report unauthorized access. If you fail to notify us, you may be liable for all unauthorized activity on your account.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL SHARING FEATURES\r\nThe Services may integrate with social sharing features and other related tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other apps, sites, or media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the social sharing service. Please refer to the privacy policies of those social sharing services for more information about how they handle the data you provide to or share through them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS  \r\nWe may allow others to provide audience measurement and analytics services for us, to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet, and to track and report on the performance of those advertisements. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, SDKs, and other technologies to identify your device when you visit our site and use our Services, as well as when you visit other online sites and services. Third-party vendors may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our Site.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to our Cookie Statement for more information about your choices around cookies and related technologies.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nYOUR CHOICES\r\nAccount Information\r\n\r\nYou may correct your account information at any time by logging into your online or in-app account. If you wish to cancel your account, please email us at Help@SteadyApp.com.  Please note that in some cases we may retain certain information about you as required by law, or for legitimate business purposes to the extent permitted by law. For instance, if you have a standing credit or debt on your account, or if we believe you have committed fraud or violated our Terms, we may seek to resolve the issue before deleting your information.\r\n\r\nAccess Rights  \r\n\r\nIndividuals may update any personal data by logging in to their profile on either the Steady website or through the Steady app.  Steady will also comply with individual's requests regarding access, correction, and/or deletion of the personal data it stores in accordance with applicable law.\r\n\r\nPromotional Communications\r\n\r\nYou may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us by following the instructions in those messages. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, about Services you have requested, or our ongoing business relations.\r\n\r\nYour California Privacy Rights\r\n\r\nCalifornia law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Steady does not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes unless you provide us with consent to do so.\r\n\r\nUnder the California Consumer Protection Act, California residents have the right to:\r\n\r\nRequest that a business delete any personal information about the consumer which the business has collected from the consumer.\r\n\r\nRequest that a business that collects personal information about the consumer disclose to the consumer, free of charge, the following:\r\n\r\nThe categories of personal information that it has collected about that consumer.\r\n\r\nThe categories of sources from which the personal information is collected.\r\n\r\nThe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.\r\n\r\nThe categories of third parties with whom the business shares personal information.\r\n\r\nThe specific pieces of personal information it has collected about that consumer.\r\n\r\nRequest that a business that sells the consumer’s personal information, or that discloses it for a business purpose disclose, free of charge, to the consumer: \r\n\r\nThe categories of personal information that the business collected about the consumer.\r\n\r\nThe categories of personal information that the business sold about the consumer and the categories of third parties to whom the personal was sold, by category or categories of personal information for each third       party to whom the personal information was sold.\r\n\r\nThe categories of personal information that the business disclosed about the consumer for a business purpose.\r\n\r\nDirect a business that sells personal information about the consumer to third parties not to sell the consumer’s personal information.\r\n\r\nYou may also designate an authorized agent to make such requests on your behalf by emailing Steady at privacy@steadyapp.com and providing sufficient identification along with a signed power of attorney designating such individual as your authorized agent.    \r\n\r\nSteady will not discriminate against you if you choose to exercise any of your rights as described in this section.  \r\n\r\nThird party links\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may include third party links on our site. By including a link to a third-party website, Steady does not endorse or recommend any products or services offered or information contained at the third-party website. These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Such third party may have a privacy policy different from that of Steady and the third-party website may provide less security protection than our website. If you decide to visit a third-party website via a link contained on the Site and/or the Services, you do so at your risk. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including if a specific link does not work).\r\n\r\nChildren Under the Age of 13\r\n\r\nOur website is not directed to or intended for access or use by, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from, children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, do not access, use or provide any information on our website or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or any screen name or username you may use. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 years of age, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13 years of age, please contact us at Help@SteadyApp.com.\r\n\r\nWe do not sell the personal information of California consumers if we have actual knowledge that the consumer is less than 16 years of age, unless the consumer, in the case of consumers between 13 and 16 years of age, or the consumer’s parent or guardian, in the case of consumers who are less than 13 years of age, has affirmatively authorized the sale of the consumer’s personal information.\r\n\r\nCOOKIES AND ADVERTISING\r\nPlease refer to our Cookie Statement for more information about your choices around cookies and related technologies.\r\n\r\nThis website does not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCHANGES TO THE STATEMENT\r\nWe may change this Statement from time to time. If we make significant changes in the way we treat your personal information, or to the Statement, we will provide you notice through the Services or by some other means, such as email. Unless otherwise stated, any modifications to this Statement will go into immediate effect after they have been posted. Your continued use of the Services after such notice constitutes your consent to the changes.

Even though Steady had a better reputation than others I was still skeptical and assumed I’d run into issues like being matched with partner companies that oversell and underdeliver the perks of their services or I’d fail to receive a booster for some minor fine print issue that kept me from eligibility, however that hasn’t been the case. I wanted to open a new checking account and that was the main reason I even downloaded Steady and hadn’t planned on giving it too much thought after... but that changed quickly after realizing Steady was solid and simple and not seemingly using trickery.\n\nI went with the $75 for opening a Varo checking account (which I’m very happy with BTW) and I was cautioned that it could take up to 60 days for the booster to deposit.I applied and open the checking account by going through steady and I got a little worried because after I finalize that it didn’t take me back to Steady and I imagined I had screwed it up somehow... but I quickly got an email that I had activated it and  I received the $75 in my new account no more than a week after I spent the required $25 on my new debit card.  \n\nI hate that I felt cynical to the point that I was so surprised when Steady steadily delivered.","title":"Wish I wasn’t surprised","userName":"jmedellinger"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5565495356","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-02-22T13:10:15Z","rating":5,"review":"I’m new to this app, but so far I am incredibly impressed! I believe it’s important to note that I am not being rewarded in any type of way to write this review; I’m doing it to provide feedback to users, \u0026 the developers. With that being said however, I’ve had this app for less than 1 month, \u0026 I have already received 2 rewards: the 1st one was a $10 e-Visa...\u0026 I received it ~ via email ~ within 1 day after completing an ‘Income Booster,’ \u0026 that timeframe is so super rare when it comes to being paid from online stores/apps. Since I’m so new tho, I still have lots of features that Steady offers that I just haven’t had the time or opportunity to complete just yet. I’ve been researching \u0026 trying out numerous different apps that are the same concept as Steady, but none have come even close. And I’m just getting started....\nI hope it only gets better from here!! I say this bcuz it’s common that when someone firsts signs up with an app, or a website such as a paid survey site, that rewards \u0026 payment thresholds are easily met \u0026 received...\u0026 then when that person is no longer “new,” the rewards, the offers to complete surveys to earn points, etc., slow to the slowest crawl, if not ceasing altogether, as I’m sure most everyone who might be reading this review has experienced.

When you first open the app is displayed, at least for me, 3 apps on the App Store that you can freelance for and a signup section on bottom to receive more. I was pretty skeptical, especially because it wanted not only my zip, but on the next page, my name, email and phone number, something I never like to give out. I had a spam number gotten via google voice that has excellent filtering built in and can be easily turned off or removed, all for free (thanks google!) so I used that. But what I got was an amazing array of possibilities of work from home. They ask a quick survey to target your interest and desires for work, nothing personally identifiable, and two buttons. One is more info, though not a lot more than an unneeded summary anyway as the description gives most of the valid details, and the other button is the link to either the hiring page or the app on the App Store. And there’s a lot of content for that too. Apps I didn’t know of, businesses offering a malinials dream job (work on your own terms) online from home, and traditional jobs from big companies in my area.\nFor reference I’m a stay at home dad trying to find more income with 1 year old.","title":"Excellent app, understandable confusion.","userName":"MetaCat119"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6510772929","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-07T17:10:07Z","rating":5,"review":"I’ve been using this app for about a year now it’s been very helpful in giving me a clear picture of where I am financially and is incredibly helpfulFor finding gigs and opportunities to earn money.

I messaged customer service and expressed my concern because It wasn’t even showing up on the boosters in progress but I had the Varo account linked to the steady account and they were still offering at a potential booster. It’s like they just didn’t recognize that I had done the booster. I didn’t lose any money but I couldn’t get the booster from at steady and I won’t be able to get a varo booster from any other app, so for reason it just missed me on the Varo booster but this may have been an issue with Varo. I was “over it” and didn’t bother asking Varo but i don’t use Varo either since it never got the booster, so as long as Steady and their partners do their part I’ll use their products, and I probably have done and been paid for at least 5 boosters. All in all it’s a good app and if it does this for someone else it might raise a flag but one hiccup isn’t gonna make me stop using it.

Don’t sign up for any job thru this app, sign up they the website’s main job sign up page, otherwise you’re just making the developers of this app money.
