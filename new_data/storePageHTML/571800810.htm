        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Thanks for using Calm! This update contains multiple bug fixes and performance improvements.<br /><br />Be sure to listen to our newest Sleep Stories including “Shakespeare’s Sonnets Part 1” narrated by actor Ramon Tikaram, where you’ll step back in time as the luxurious words of William Shakespeare prepare you for peaceful sleep. Or join Agnes and the Minions as they make up a new bedtime story in “Minions in Space.” And don’t forget to listen to world-renowned actor Matthew McConaughey’s Sleep Story about the mysteries of the universe in “Wonder.”<br /><br />LeBron James shares the habits and principles to keep his mind strong in his new “Train Your Mind - Vol. II” series on Calm. And don’t miss out on one of our newest meditation programs by meditation teacher and author Lama Rod Owens, titled “Radical Self-Care,” where you’ll discover the tools of self-care and create a nourishing practice of reflection and rest. Or try our meditation series “Daily Trip” by meditation instructor Jeff Warren, where you’ll explore fresh techniques and tools for your practice.<br /><br />Lull yourself into a deep sleep cycle with “Light and Space,” an ethereal, hypnotic blend of music, soothing frequencies and singing bowls by singer-songwriter Beatie Wolfe. Or listen to Calm’s Sleep Remixes, which are beloved songs deconstructed and designed to set a tempo for heading to bed, featuring celebrated artists including Shawn Mendes, Kacey Musgraves, Ariana Grande, Post Malone, and many more. And drift off to peaceful piano lullabies from Disney classics like Aladdin, Pocahontas, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Moana, Mulan, and more. <br />While you’re waiting for the update to install, try this simple practice: Relax your body and get comfortable, then turn your attention to the breath. Keeping the rhythm of your breathing natural, just observe your breath as it flows in and out. Notice how it moves in and out of the body with curiosity. Breathe each breath as though for the very first time.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Take a deep breath. That phrase greets you whenever you open Calm. It’s both a call to action and a defining feature of the app’s approach to meditation: you’re going to get through this, and all you need to start is a moment. In the increasingly crowded field of apps for meditation and mindfulness, Calm stands out for its ease of use and attention to (soothing) detail. </p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love the Calm app!  I stumbled upon a television commercial about it a few years ago and decided to give it a try.  I have had trouble falling asleep for years, and was honestly skeptical that an app would put me to sleep. Boy was I wrong!  I love the different options - sleep stories, music, meditation - each one is interesting, and while I can’t say I’ve managed to get to end of a story…well that’s the point.  I’m out within five minutes.  I’ve read some reviews about the expense - here’s the thing - what is your sleep and a relaxed mindset worth to you?  Divide that annual cost by 365 and you’re paying a pittance for your health.  Check back around the holidays - the makers of Calm run specials sometimes that make it even more worthwhile.  I had just renewed my annual fee two summers ago, when an end of year special came around.  It was a lifetime subscription that was going to save hundreds of dollars over the years. I knew I wouldn’t get the remainder of my annual fee (8 months left) refunded if I jumped on the lifetime subscription, but it was still worth the jump.  This is a must have app. <br /><br />*App makers - please put the sleep check-in back!  With the latest update it is gone, and it was something that really helped understanding factors that affect sleep.</p>

    So relaxing and amazing

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I absolutely love love love this app!!!!♥️ once I could not go to sleep so I turned on some of the calm music and I fell asleep 10 minutes later. I was amazed. I have been getting better sleep since than. Also whenever I am feeling stressed or anxious about someone or something, I listen to one of the daily calms or the next day on the meditation trial. Right away it’s as if you were brought into some beautiful relaxing world where there are these voices saying “It will be ok no matter what. This will pass.” And it does its amazing how calming and peaceful this app is. Next, mood check in. The mood check in helps me express and release good and bad feelings and thoughts. Enjoy the good ones and let go of the bad ones. It even gives you a chance to write a little about them. It’s like your own personal diary, but way better. Last but definitely not least, I Believe this app can make you a better person. To be happier, to live life longer. It can be a real life changer. And just know that it’s never to late to start fresh again.  It’s never to late to change yourself. But most of all, it’s never to late lo be the big change in the world, that you have wished for. And calm can help with all of that. This is a total recommendation for anyone.</p>

I stumbled upon a television commercial about it a few years ago and decided to give it a try.  I have had trouble falling asleep for years, and was honestly skeptical that an app would put me to sleep. Boy was I wrong!  I love the different options - sleep stories, music, meditation - each one is interesting, and while I can’t say I’ve managed to get to end of a story…well that’s the point.  I’m out within five minutes.  I’ve read some reviews about the expense - here’s the thing - what is your sleep and a relaxed mindset worth to you?  Divide that annual cost by 365 and you’re paying a pittance for your health.  Check back around the holidays - the makers of Calm run specials sometimes that make it even more worthwhile.  I had just renewed my annual fee two summers ago, when an end of year special came around.  It was a lifetime subscription that was going to save hundreds of dollars over the years. I knew I wouldn’t get the remainder of my annual fee (8 months left) refunded if I jumped on the lifetime subscription, but it was still worth the jump.  This is a must have app. \n\n*App makers - please put the sleep check-in back!  With the latest update it is gone, and it was something that really helped understanding factors that affect sleep.","title":"Great app, use it every night","userName":"Ak hockey907"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5796030028","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-11T13:11:09Z","rating":5,"review":"I absolutely love love love this app!!!!♥️ once I could not go to sleep so I turned on some of the calm music and I fell asleep 10 minutes later. I was amazed. I have been getting better sleep since than. Also whenever I am feeling stressed or anxious about someone or something, I listen to one of the daily calms or the next day on the meditation trial. Right away it’s as if you were brought into some beautiful relaxing world where there are these voices saying “It will be ok no matter what. This will pass.” And it does its amazing how calming and peaceful this app is. Next, mood check in. The mood check in helps me express and release good and bad feelings and thoughts. Enjoy the good ones and let go of the bad ones. It even gives you a chance to write a little about them. It’s like your own personal diary, but way better. Last but definitely not least, I Believe this app can make you a better person. To be happier, to live life longer. It can be a real life changer. And just know that it’s never to late to start fresh again.  It’s never to late to change yourself. But most of all, it’s never to late lo be the big change in the world, that you have wished for.

Nothing, I mean nothing had helped me until I found this app. The meditation \u0026 sleep stories are amazing. I am so grateful for this app. Now, the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars would be due to a recommend I have for the creators, they should create a watch or something that can track your sleep \u0026 in the morning provide meditations, music, sleep stories that reflected how you slept the night before. For example, if someone woke up a lot, or of people were waking up frequently and having a hard time going back to sleep \u0026  maybe making suggestions for  a meditation they could choose that one as more personal, or for anxiety with sleep or sleeplessness, things like that.

It has changed my perspectives and state-of-mind in ways that have been beneficial to every aspect of my everyday life and well-being, in a countless number of ways. By committing to the habit and genuine effort to a mere 10 minutes of meditation a day, I have observed a significant change to the way my brain works and handles day-to-day tasks and situations. I have gained peace-of-mind, appreciation, more quality and meaningful time spent with my family, the ability to approach things in ways that are more practical and productive and less stressful.... And this is just to name a few ways meditation has been useful and life-changing. My 10yo son insists on using it before bed every night in order to help him unwind and get a better night’s sleep. I use it for tension relief and to soothe migraines, or to calm myself down when I’m angry or upset. The mind is so powerful and can truly enhance one’s quality of life and well-being in ways you could never imagine possible. By obtaining a better mindset and maintaining the ways in which your brain works and thinks, you can come to realize what sort of impact it can make on your overall health, happiness and life.","title":"Worth so much more than I ever imagined","userName":"rknaakable"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6711860012","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-12-03T06:15:22Z","rating":4,"review":"I love this app and use it all the time. Loads of new content added constantly. The length of the meditations is perfect. I love the series like 7 days of calm, 7 days of sleep, etc. the breathing exercises are so helpful. \n\nOne area for improvement would be that currently most of the meditations, especially new content, is narrated by the same woman. It would be really helpful if these same sessions were recorded with a male voice, so listeners could have an option.  It would also be helpful if there were a more diverse selection of voices throughout the meditations. (This is done in the master classes and sleep stories, but I’d like to see it in the meditations too). A second area would be a review of the content of the gratitude meditations, which make assumptions and are therefore injurious for some listeners. For example I am in the middle of fighting a long term disease. Suggestions like you should be grateful for your health are not helpful and actually harmful for me. I’d really like to cultivate more gratitude but I can’t get through any of these meditations without being triggered. A review by someone working with diverse populations could help this. \n\nOther than this, I love the app. It has been designed so well and my mental health has improved dramatically since starting to use it.

I enjoy/prefer non-fiction stories and have heard all offerings multiple times. I find the whispered stories super creepy… But maybe thats just me. I haven’t listened to any music selections.\nFor the high subscription price though, the app should be nearly perfect, when in fact there are features missing. First, I wish that they would allow you to remove the stories that you don’t care for from the “playlist” so you wouldn’t have to sift through them each time you look for something you want to listen to. Additionally they are EXTRAORDINARILY SLOW to add new stories so consequently I have listened to the same “favorite” stories many many many times. I wish also that there were an option to list stories by “newest” so if they do add a new one it will readily be evident. The “nap” stories should not be listed with the “sleep” stories, since those have a “wake up” feature at the end.\nWith a few minor tweaks to allow a user personalize their preferences and more frequent content updates, this app could be exceptional.","title":"helps u sleep, app needs options for personalization","userName":"Sellsews"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6114739748","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-24T04:02:44Z","rating":3,"review":"Dear calm, \n\nI have had your app since my middle school years. I’ve got to say, your app was AMAZING with 15 sleep stories and 2 and 1/2 meditations, this wasn’t a problem for me because I also use headspace. Yes, they're your competition but I wasn't choosing sides. Anyways, over time you guys added feature that you really focused on for 2 weeks at a time and just gave up on it. Next, you decreased the amount of sleep stories which was ha a huge problem for me because I was NOT getting enough sleep to keep my grades up. It got so bad that I stole my mother's phone just to sleep (she Had the Premium subscription). So I was like, ”ok, I'll just use headspace ONLY for sleep and calm for meditation. Then, you took away the 7 days of calm AKA: YOUR MAIN TRIAL AND ONLY TRIAL MEDITATION LEFT after you premiumfied the 7 days of something (forgot). I mean like BRU, I have other options. I started using headspace which is a great alternative if you don't have much money. I recommend bringing back some stuff from premium and reduce the price. To counteract this, put one 15 second ad at the beginning. Of every session of meditation for people without premium. Therefore, there is more than one reason to get it and it's CHEAPER. That's a win-win situation. I hope you come to the right decision.

However because of the issues described in the title I probably will no longer subscribe to calm next year. I am blind, and use the screen reader voiceover. I can play the videos for the content well enough with play pause, fastforward but the biggest barrier I am facing is that the mountains which you tap on in the for you tab  to bring up the settings are unlabeled. I was trying to turn off the babbling Brook sound, accessible apps need to have text labels to accompany any clickable items. I would love to resubscribe once you have resolved these issues, buttons for the mood check-in feature are also unlabeled or nonexistent. The box breathing technique does not speak anything aloud or refresh on its own. A better way to accomplish that might be to use a metronome with 44 times signature. I am happy to speak to a developer more about my feedback and suggestions for how to resolve these issues, but I think that especially since healthcare providers are starting to recommend your service to their users, many of them who use Medicaid and Medicare and are disabled the app absolutely should be more accessible.

They have told me it’s the favorite part for their week.  Some students have even gotten the app for themselves.

This really works.  What did you all think about?”  You know you are doing something right when teenagers open up and start talking.

I got it solely for the sleep stories and I’m absolutely obsessed. It’s like being a kid again and getting a beautiful story read to you by a soothing voice. While I use the app mainly for sleep stories I’ve used the meditation, background music, and breathing exercise options on the app as well. I used to use Headspace for a lot of my meditation sessions but with Calm having so many additional features I switched over fairly quickly. \n\nThe only problem I have with this app is that I can’t set up a playlist/cue of the stories I want to fall asleep to. Sometimes I can’t fall asleep right away so I have to go through the process of unlocking my phone, setting up another story, and trying to settle down once again just to set up another story to be read. It quickly becomes irritating, especially on nights when I can’t fall asleep easily and have to go through the process of setting up an additional three stories and eventually giving up in the end. \n\nSo if that can somehow be added then it’ll get my full 5 stars.
