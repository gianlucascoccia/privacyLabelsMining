        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Always new things, always do layouts, always fun. This is the only app I have found that is both visually appealing, highly customizable and has oodles of info available. There is now a map  available with layers that can show features like radar, storms cells and their projected directions, weather fronts (really hard to find apps that show the weather fronts on them!), A feature called cards that you can customize to show additional information that you want to see, and customizable notifications. For example you can set to be notified if there is a lightning strike within X many miles, where X is customizable. You can set the notification for during the day only or overnight. You can have notifications sent to you yes for example snow accumulation will be greater than 2 inches for the day. Just some of the features that Carol now offers. Love this app. I have had it for five years and have been amazed how much development there has been – especially since it’s the product of one person, not a company. Get the Premium Club, because it’s cheap and really worth it. And every once in a while throw something in the tiptoe jar so that he can keep on developing new looks, etc.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I never leave reviews, but I felt compelled to after seeing some folks ripping on the new UI. Sure, it takes a bit of getting used to and can feel a little modern and bright for some, but this is a fun take on weather. If you want a basic weather app, you know where to go. The data isn’t immediately easy to navigate like before because it’s so different, but wow, once you figure out where things are at, it’s far and away the best weather app out there. I found the old version to be a little light on the data I was seeking, and the precipitation forecasts wildly unreliable in my area. It seems they’ve adjusted that algorithm, and we’ll see if it’s improved. For now, the main takeaway here is that they are presenting weather-related data here that we ACTUALLY care about, that other apps aren’t. I’m spending twice as much time on this app now because it’s just fun to use (maybe I’m just a nerd). They even have Wikipedia break downs of wind, precipitation, moon phases, etc! It’s fascinating. The day and hourly breakdowns are really nicely executed as well and I love seeing the temperature graphs. Also, they give you much more in the entry level version than they did prior.<br /><br />Don’t change the layout, it’s fantastic.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Let’s face it. You’re not here because you want a weather app that’ll tell you the weather and nothing else. No. What you really want is a sadistic computer named after a root vegetable who’ll threaten to strike you dead with lightning like Zeus and explain things about the world you didn’t particularly want to know (“Today is a good day to try to win over your crush by FedExing them one of your body parts,” she may tell you when it’s sunny) all while gathering achievements when you experience a flood or fire warning, hearing the occasional unsolicited political comment (you can turn it off if you want), and playing fun geography puzzles that may or may not be a disguise for the calibrating of a missile targeting system.<br />But if you take yourself a little too seriously, you can always turn off her personality, (which is just cruel when you think about it) or if your feeling especially masochistic, switch it to Overkill Mode, in which she will cuss and threaten and tease and generally take everything you hold sacred and grind it to dust under her cold, metal boot.<br />As you can tell, this app is a great deal of fun and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a hearty laugh in their daily routine. And maybe a little bit of threatening.</p>

There is now a map  available with layers that can show features like radar, storms cells and their projected directions, weather fronts (really hard to find apps that show the weather fronts on them!), A feature called cards that you can customize to show additional information that you want to see, and customizable notifications. For example you can set to be notified if there is a lightning strike within X many miles, where X is customizable. You can set the notification for during the day only or overnight. You can have notifications sent to you yes for example snow accumulation will be greater than 2 inches for the day. Just some of the features that Carol now offers. Love this app. I have had it for five years and have been amazed how much development there has been – especially since it’s the product of one person, not a company.

Sure, it takes a bit of getting used to and can feel a little modern and bright for some, but this is a fun take on weather. If you want a basic weather app, you know where to go. The data isn’t immediately easy to navigate like before because it’s so different, but wow, once you figure out where things are at, it’s far and away the best weather app out there. I found the old version to be a little light on the data I was seeking, and the precipitation forecasts wildly unreliable in my area. It seems they’ve adjusted that algorithm, and we’ll see if it’s improved. For now, the main takeaway here is that they are presenting weather-related data here that we ACTUALLY care about, that other apps aren’t. I’m spending twice as much time on this app now because it’s just fun to use (maybe I’m just a nerd). They even have Wikipedia break downs of wind, precipitation, moon phases, etc! It’s fascinating. The day and hourly breakdowns are really nicely executed as well and I love seeing the temperature graphs. Also, they give you much more in the entry level version than they did prior.\n\nDon’t change the layout, it’s fantastic.","title":"The new update is fantastic","userName":"bjhornbeck"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7301384962","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-05-05T15:20:41Z","rating":5,"review":"Let’s face it.

No. What you really want is a sadistic computer named after a root vegetable who’ll threaten to strike you dead with lightning like Zeus and explain things about the world you didn’t particularly want to know (“Today is a good day to try to win over your crush by FedExing them one of your body parts,” she may tell you when it’s sunny) all while gathering achievements when you experience a flood or fire warning, hearing the occasional unsolicited political comment (you can turn it off if you want), and playing fun geography puzzles that may or may not be a disguise for the calibrating of a missile targeting system.\nBut if you take yourself a little too seriously, you can always turn off her personality, (which is just cruel when you think about it) or if your feeling especially masochistic, switch it to Overkill Mode, in which she will cuss and threaten and tease and generally take everything you hold sacred and grind it to dust under her cold, metal boot.\nAs you can tell, this app is a great deal of fun and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a hearty laugh in their daily routine.

There’s more information on the watch than I really need which is pretty good, cuz it’s there if I want it without having to hunt for it.   I tried a bunch before trying Carrot.  I always ended up getting a refund they were so lousy.  None of them were very accurate, or they drained my battery as fast as it could.  One required location services on always or it wouldn’t even load.  Insane.  Location services sitting in my living room??  If I don’t travel who cares??  I’m not a fan of subscription services but for what you get with carrot it was worth it to me.  The snarky comments are entertaining, and the layout is easy to read \u0026 visually pleasing.

Carrot comes very close to my ideal.  The “snark” factor is amusing and unique and, while others will no-doubt continue to use it, I moved beyond it pretty quickly  and just use the “boring” mode!  Carrot is extremely well thought out, with current conditions, hourly and daily forecasts arranged in a smart and very readable layout.  I love being able to switch between Dark Sky and Wunderground weather sources with a tap, and quick access to the radar map is a real plus.  The only other weather app that has this combination of features and design smarts is BeWeather (another excellent weather app), and it’s a real horse race between the two.  What disappoints me about Carrot and keeps it from being a 5-Star app is the conspicuous lack of baked-in notifications.  To get severe weather alerts on your iPhone, you must purchase a separate app for your Mac and then have the two devices talk to each other via iCloud.  Way too many steps and $$ for something that is the de facto standard in most other first-rate weather apps.  I really hope the Carrotians will re-consider this approach.  That would garner 5 stars from me and a renewal of my subscription.","title":"Weather with attitude","userName":"moose_squirrel"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4226857427","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-05-28T21:12:10Z","developerResponse":{"id":8848131,"body":"Not every weather data source can be accurate in every corner of the world.

(Developer response: “Not every weather data source can be accurate in every corner of the world. That’s why I took the trouble to incorporate a bunch of additional weather data sources in the app.”  But the issue is that whatever sources in use don’t seem to be connecting to the summary page. Example: today it’s been storming outside.  The radar map in the app even shows it, but the chance of precipitation on the summary page at the same time says 0%.)\n\nAlso don’t like that I paid for this app and I don’t get notifications.  Hell, even Candy Crush has notifications. (Revision after developer response - yes, they do have notifications. I stand corrected. But after paying for the app, you’d have to pay more to be a premium member to get the basic function of notifications.)\n\nFuture radar would be helpful too.

It’s highly configurable, which I enjoy and makes a lot of sense because everyone is looking to get something a little different out of a weather app. Trying to please everyone is never a recipe for a great product, but Carrot includes a lot of options and features with a UI that focuses on what’s important. So kudos for that.\n\nOne of the main things that drew me to this app was the developer’s promise not to sell user data. I live in Oklahoma, so I mainly rely on weather apps from local news stations, since weather is regularly a matter of life and death here and local sources are the most reliable and knowledgeable here. But I’d be shocked if those stations are not tracking users and selling data. I can’t switch entirely to Carrot yet though because the radar resolution in Carrot is terrible. Half the time I can’t even recognize a hook echo that’s clearly visible on News 9’s radar map. It would also be nice if there were more frames in the radar animation, but that’s not a huge deal.\n\nSo, to the developer, I don’t know if you can get a higher resolution radar source, but that’s going to be a requirement from me before I’ll subscribe, because without it I can’t completely give up other apps.","title":"Needs Better Radar","userName":"1947"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7449572078","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-06-10T18:10:11Z","rating":5,"review":"Imagine one day you find yourself walking in Central Park.

Eager to prove his dubious sign wrong, you order a small vanilla cone which is not only the specialty of this cart whose name is apparently “ice creams” (quotes included), but also the only choice on the poorly made menu. The man, seeing the obvious doubt and disdain in your eyes, hands you a long cylindrical shape wrapped in a swath of dirty burlap, and mumbles “no charge”. You carefully unwrap the burlap to find, not a vanilla cone, which you somehow still assumed it would be; but instead you are oddly delighted to find an uncooked hotdog. You glance questioningly at skinny jeans, gesturing towards the hotdog, and without a moment of hesitation, he grabs the wiener from your outstretched hand, flips it over and now somehow, it is not only an ice cream cone, but the absolute best ice cream cone you have ever had in your entire life.

You updated it only to take away features and make me pay more for something I already had.

I could quickly tap on a day and see a great overview of what was happening.\n\nNow - even with the 4.0 layout option - that’s all gone. None of the things stay in sync, so I have to scroll to the hour I want, tap it, and then look back up to see.
