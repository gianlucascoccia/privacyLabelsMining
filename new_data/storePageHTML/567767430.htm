We love the easy-to-follow videos with their relaxing narration and soothing music, plus the way we can schedule sessions right into our calendars. There are even custom-made classes for everything from curious beginners to runners looking to limber up. Scorpion pose or bust! (Let’s be honest—probably bust.)</p>

However, now there are more options to choose from but I have to pay a monthly fee which I am not interested in - would want to only see the classes that were included with the original purchase so I don’t see the other options.  If you want me to be a beta user for any new classes you are introducing, offer it to me as a free trial and I will provide feedback, but for now I would love to have my clean original version of the Yoga Studio App back. <br /><br />Previous review: It has been years now that I have been using this app and still love it.  I have built strength in the process and now am able to follow the Advance collection. I am amazed by how well this App is designed and the transition from one pose to the next is flawless.  I would love to see more options under the Advance Collection that are harder but shorter.  Please add breathing exercises as well which will take this already awesome app to a whole new level. I thank Yoga Studio for guiding me and helping me become a better Yogi.  <br />This app is highly recommended for all individuals at any level in their Yoga Quest.</p>

    Let me tell you why this app is 5 Star worthy

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>First, I have a personal hatred of subscription apps.  When your subscription ends, you have nothing. 😡I’d greatly prefer to pay for it outright, even if it’s a steep price or if I have to pay again for new content.  However, I’ve been wanting to get back into yoga and was dead tired of the DVDS I bought way back when.  (I also have a personal hatred of yoga classes, so that’s out.) I decided to give Yoga Studio a try.  I figured I’d know within 7 days (the free trial) if I liked it.  And I do!  It actually only took three days to decide I love it.  I love that there’s something for my years away from yoga self that makes me feel I can do it again but is challenging, too.  The variety is also impressive. In over month of practicing at least three times per week I’ve only repeated classes because I particularly liked them.  There is plenty of content to do a new class every day.  I also like being able to create my own class “mixes” from other classes.  The teachers are clear and calm and the music is not intrusive.  I like that it syncs with Apple Health automatically, and I like the calendar that tracks your sessions and allows you to schedule classes for reminders. I really do love Yoga Studio.  The only thing I’d change is switch from subscription to purchase.</p>

Data collected through your use of the Application is governed by this Privacy Policy. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using the Application.\n\nBy accessing or using Yoga Studio, you consent to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. We may modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time effective upon its posting on www.yogastudioapp.com. Your continued use of this Application constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and any modifications or updates thereto.\n\nPersonal Information\n\nYour use of Yoga Studio may cause certain information, including information you may consider personal to you (\"Personal Information\"), to be stored locally on your mobile phone, tablet, media player, or personal computer (\"Device\"). This data includes specific details of the workouts you perform (\"Fitness Data\"). We will treat your Personal Information and Fitness Data as confidential (see relevant sections below). We will not share your Personal Information or Fitness Data with third parties, such as third party service providers and/or advertisers.\n\nBy default, Personal Information and Fitness Data is stored locally on your Device. You may also opt to store Fitness Data with Apple's Health App Database (see relevant sections below). No Personal Information or Fitness Data is sent to our servers or stored in our servers at any point.\n\nApple Health App Integration\n\nYou may opt to integrate Yoga Studio with Apple's Health App Database. If you grant Yoga Studio access to Apple's Health App Database, Yoga Studio will import your data from the Health App Database into the Application in certain circumstances, such as to aid you in the tracking of fitness goals. In addition, Yoga Studio may transfer data that you store locally on your Device, such as calories burned, to the Health App Database. Yoga Studio cannot read from or write to the Health App Database unless you grant access. Data accessed from the Health App Database will never be shared with third parties, such as third party service providers and/or advertisers.\n\nYoga Studio is in no way responsible for the protection of the Fitness Data and/or other information stored within Apple's Health App Database. You and Apple are solely responsible for the protection of such information in the Health App Database. Please review Apple's applicable policies and procedures before syncing and backing up your Fitness Data and/or other information with the Health App Database.\n\nSharing Information\n\nYoga Studio allows you to share certain information, such as your completed practices, with social networks, including Facebook and Twitter. Yoga Studio will never automatically share your information to social networks and/or third parties without your consent.\n\nYoga Studio is in no way responsible for the protection of any information that you choose to share with social networks. You and such social networks are solely responsible for the protection of such information. Please review any applicable policies and procedures of such social networks before sharing your information therein.\n\nAggregated Data Collection\n\nYoga Studio may automatically collect anonymous information regarding your interaction with, and use of, Yoga Studio. Information we may collect includes, but is not limited to, device identifier and hardware information, system type, and other information about your interactions with the Application. This data is never linked to your Personal Information or Fitness Data, and we do not use it to identify you personally.\n\nSecurity\n\nWe take reasonable steps to protect information about you that is in our possession and control, such as your Personal Information and Fitness Data, from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Unfortunately, no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. In particular, email sent between you and us may not be secure, due, for instance, to the security practices that you, your email carrier, and/or Internet provider employ. You should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any personal data to us via the Internet.\n\nYou are solely responsible for the protection of your Device, including any use of Yoga Studio or any storage of Personal Information or Fitness Data incident to the use of Yoga Studio on your Device. Please consult your Device's documentation on how to manage local storage and how to apply appropriate security controls to the Device for the protection of information such as passwords. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Device password.\n\nPersonal Information or Fitness Data that is stored on your Device is your responsibility. In the event that your Device becomes lost or inoperable, your Fitness Data may not be recoverable (see relevant sections above).\n\nPrivacy Policy Updates\n\nAt times it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy such as due to changes in the services we offer, Apple's policies and procedures, Google's policies and procedures, and/or the applicable laws of the United States. We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically, especially before you provide any Personal Information or Fitness Data to Yoga Studio.\n\nThis Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated below. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on www.yogastudioapp.com.

When your subscription ends, you have nothing. 😡I’d greatly prefer to pay for it outright, even if it’s a steep price or if I have to pay again for new content.  However, I’ve been wanting to get back into yoga and was dead tired of the DVDS I bought way back when.  (I also have a personal hatred of yoga classes, so that’s out.) I decided to give Yoga Studio a try.  I figured I’d know within 7 days (the free trial) if I liked it.  And I do!  It actually only took three days to decide I love it.  I love that there’s something for my years away from yoga self that makes me feel I can do it again but is challenging, too.  The variety is also impressive. In over month of practicing at least three times per week I’ve only repeated classes because I particularly liked them.  There is plenty of content to do a new class every day.  I also like being able to create my own class “mixes” from other classes.  The teachers are clear and calm and the music is not intrusive.  I like that it syncs with Apple Health automatically, and I like the calendar that tracks your sessions and allows you to schedule classes for reminders. I really do love Yoga Studio.

I do look out of curiosity but I am astounded that this app still leaves a lot of other yoga apps in the dust especially when it comes to clear rich  and straightforward instruction . \n\nI've started this review several times and realized, I think I have sent it and haven't. I continue to rely heavily on this app and only one other that is more pricey but is worth it. I had generally liked the direction of things until the hip hop yoga. I am a fan of hip hop but I am not sure this was the best matched instructor or best use of innovation. Despite that, I do look forward to some of the other things that are coming. We are overdue for some pranayama. So thanks! In my humble opinion, I'd hoped to see some expansion of the various essentials, like a 15-minute intermediate essential practice for balance or a deeper dive into the the different kinds of sun salutations. I am a big fan of the earth salutations(noting there are a lot of balancing poses in those practices) and earth meditations. Overall, keep coming with the great offerings.

It’s one of the better yoga apps for sure. The upgrade from version 3 wasn’t that clean. I had previously purchased the “full content upgrade” early on in version 1 and that would restore all the original yoga programs through version 3. With version 4, that purchase will not restore, so I was forced to sign up for the subscription model to access the app content. I also had all my yoga sessions tracked in the calendar for the last three months, which was nice to refer to to track my consistency. That data did not make it through the upgrade from version 3 to version 4, so now I have an empty calendar view. I’m assuming that data is now lost for good. It would be nice for the developer to honor my original upgrade purchase and unlock the content, but they may be forcing everyone to the subscription model; many developers are doing that now so they have a more sustainable revenue. The new version of the app seems to work well with the exception of a few rough edges in the fit and finish department – some of the images used in parts of the app don’t look optimized for large Retinal displays like the iPad Pro 12 or the iPhone X.

I recommended it to literally anyone who would listen. I paid a flat fee for it up front, and used it on a regular basis. But then at some point they forced an update that locked me out of my account for several weeks. After loads of emails and updates, they finally have the app functioning again, but I have not been able to recover my custom classes. \n\nI’m really frustrated with this whole experience because they made a very similar transition on their meditation app but without all the nonsense and without blocking you from using it for any length of time. I understand asking us to pay for content, but you can’t change the terms of your purchase agreement without some kind of advance notice. Based on our original agreement, I owned the app as it previously existed on my phone. \n\nThe original app experience made me think quite highly of Gaiam - a brand that really wasn’t on my radar before. But after this whole mess, I’m really disappointed and feel like they don’t work with integrity to spring this kind of change on a product that’s already been purchased without requiring opt-in agreement prior to any changes.

I love this app and find it to be the best yoga app I’ve used. I’m so glad thankful they’ve honored previous subscribers’ memberships. I had started using another app which I didn’t like as much. This one is great due to the interface being so simple and logical. You can find classes easily that fit your needs and the moves are varied within each routine. The other one I used had a lot of reputation and the explanations were t clear so I had to pause a lot. I also like the voice abs music options. Thanks!!\n\nSUGGESTION: it would be nice to have different duration options for each of the classes. For example, one of my go to options is beginner balance and there is only a 30 minute option. I have to choose other routines if I want 60 minutes. It would be nice to have 15, 30, 60 minutes for each routine. Honestly, I preferred the look of the previous app. Much more intuitive to have the categories all visible on each page and then have trees under each. \n\nI already paid $5 for this app and now you’re charging me for a subscription??

FWIW, Gaiam seems to listen to its customers: They eventually allowed previous buyers to access their purchase again via the Restore function.

With this newest update, it has moved to a tiered subscription model that forces even existing users who have already paid for the app to select a monthly plan to continue using it. It's like charging a new monthly rental fee to someone who has already paid for a movie years ago from the iTunes store.

You can customize your classes by selecting from a very good number of poses (not all, but A LOT). Custom classes are seamless. The “pre-loaded” classes are a great selection and the sequences are well put together. They break down the classes by levels (Beginners, Intermediate, etc.) and then those categories are broken down into various classes like Strength, Flexibility, Relaxation OR a combination class! There is even a section you can go to to review the poses and their variations, almost like a study flip card. I find when I am not on the mat, I am reading about new poses and reviewing poses I already practice well. Very well thought out app. There are a few advancements I think they will make in the near future, including adding more and more poses (at least I hope!) but as the app stands it is very well done.

I would love to see you guys show your appreciation to your original legacy customers by giving us full access to the app without paying for a subscription, or at the very least offer a permanent subscription discount. However I know that I, personally, will not change the company's decisions and reasons for doing so. Just sharing my thoughts. Thank you for an amazing app and I sincerely hope you can once again share your love for your long time customers.","title":"Incredible app - Poor Customer Value (Legacy Users)","userName":"Rescuecat1217"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7833323580","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-09-22T14:26:09Z","rating":1,"review":"App seems purposefully designed to make it difficult to figure out subscriptions because there doesn’t actually seem to be anywhere in the app to look at the different subscription models and what you get access to. You have to be prompted for a subscription by the app by trying to access a paid resource. I looked everywhere in settings on the app and the closest thing they have is the Subscription Info section which basically tells you how a subscription works but doesn’t actually provide details or give you an option to select one. The only place you can actually do it is through the Purchases section of your iCloud settings AFTER you’ve already signed up for a trial subscription which conveniently is not explained anywhere on the app. They defaulted me to the yearly subscription so I am grateful I found it before my trial ran out. Wasn’t satisfied with the courses either. I am new to yoga so I started with the beginner courses that did a pretty good job of explaining the starter poses in 10 min sessions but then after a few classes jump immediately into stuff I’m not experienced with in a 30 min session that went way too fast for me to figure out what I was supposed to be doing and added tools to the workout I conveniently couldn’t find out would be used in the next class until after I got my subscription. I’ve cancelled my trial and will be seeking other resources.","title":"Disappointed","userName":"BornThisGay"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1229430268","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"Yoga Studio is the 1.99 monthly subscription offering for users wanting to try Yoga Studio."},"isMerchandisedEnabled":false,"isMerchandisedVisibleByDefault":false,"isSubscription":true,"name":"Yoga Studio","offerName":"yoga.studio.monthly","releaseDate":"2009-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","subscriptionFamilyId":"20392564","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yoga-studio/id567767430"},"relationships":{"offers":{"data":[{"id":"ember93903598","type":"offer"}]}}},{"id":"1437737583","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"Namaste is the 9.99 monthly subscription"},"isMerchandisedEnabled":false,"isMerchandisedVisibleByDefault":false,"isSubscription":true,"name":"Namaste","offerName":"yoga.studio.namaste_monthly","releaseDate":"2009-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","subscriptionFamilyId":"20392564","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/namaste/id567767430"},"relationships":{"offers":{"data":[{"id":"ember93903599","type":"offer"}]}}},{"id":"1230934323","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"Yoga Studio Pro is the quarterly(3 months) subscription offering for users wanting to use Yoga Studio."},"isMerchandisedEnabled":false,"isMerchandisedVisibleByDefault":false,"isSubscription":true,"name":"Yoga Studio Pro","offerName":"yoga.studio.quarterly","releaseDate":"2009-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","subscriptionFamilyId":"20392564","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yoga-studio-pro/id567767430"},"relationships":{"offers":{"data":[{"id":"ember93903600","type":"offer"}]}}},{"id":"1230935228","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"Yoga Studio Power is the yearly subscription offering for those who plan to practice on a regular basis throughout the year.
