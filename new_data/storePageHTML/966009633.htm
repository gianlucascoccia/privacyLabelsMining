    Very Cool Looping GIFs and Videos Made Easy

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>What a delightful find, this is!  Making video clips or GIFs that loop seamlessly is difficult, at best, and Werble makes it easy; import a photo from your camera roll and add pre-built looping elements atop it — things like random graphic design pieces or flames or falling leaves; there are tons of things available (most as IAPs, but no subscription—buy the element once and you can use it as much as you want for as long as you want).  The elements that are included are a great way to get a feel for the app and if you think it’d be worth it to buy other element packs.  For me, it was a no-brainer; many of the element packs are tremendously useful for my work.  (I do media production professionally, and have already found ways to incorporate some of the stuff I build in Werble into my work.)<br /><br />This is an easy to use app that makes it fun to build spectacular animations on your favorite iOS device.<br /><br />(My only complaint about it is that as of now, they only offer square canvases, but I wrote to the developer and they tell me that different aspect ratios are on the way!)</p>

    Amazing- this is development evolution

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So impressed, so useful for designers/artists. I consider it an amazing design tool. We needed this. Artists and designers have searched for exactly this for years. You guys are the only ones who have actually pulled it off. The future is so bright for this software. This will bring forth a new evolution for content creators/designers/artists, marketing, etc. so not only is it an awesome design tool, it’s so much fun!! I hope to see you guys expand the software- I believe this will be a goto tool for designers.<br /><br />Great work! I hope to see deeper design options for advanced users, custom text animations, and the ability to export various high resolution video sizes like 16:9 etc. I see this being a great great tool for web designers too. So if we can mask things off and export in a transparent way for the way for the web that would be even cooler. For example animating a logo without a white background having the ability to do it with a transparent background video export would be amazing. <br /><br />Anyway- I love what you guys have done it’s exciting and so radical.</p>

We have a lot of new features and art planned for you, some of which include:  multiple photo import (with alpha), landscape and portrait support, mask and matte tools, custom text tool (with animation) and more besides.  Your idea for exporting video with alpha is an interesting one.  We will look into that!  Thank you again for your fantastic support - we look forward to bringing you these features 😊 👍</p>

    Amazing App With One TERRIBLE Problem

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is the greatest app to use for animating your art. I use Werble extensively to create artwork for podcasts on social media. But after emailing the developers more than once for over a year, we are still unable to SAVE our projects within the app! This is absolutely ridiculous. <br /><br />If you are designing an animated piece and you go to a different app to find an additional picture to include in your art, Werble can suddenly “refresh” and you lose all your progress with absolutely no way to get it back. What kind of “professional” app is this?!? Checking the app size on my iPhone shows the app uses over 5GB in storage. The cache is all there from every project I’ve made in two years. <br /><br />LET US SAVE OUR PROJECTS. Stop making new features when the most important one is still missing. I was promised a year ago by the developers that this feature would be “available soon”. Is this a joke? I cannot recommend this app to other artists due to this very simple feature being missing. Also missing is another simple feature: an “undo” option in case you mistakenly move a layer. Scroll through critical reviews on here and witness the developers promising everyone that these features are “coming soon”. Over a year is not considered “coming soon”.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi there,  we are actively working on project save, autosave and undo functionality. These are the priority in terms of the next app features.  In terms of storage, the core app is about 150 MB, and then you are downloading effects to your phone.  We have a lot of effects in the app, so despite compression and other optimisations, you can still download an awful lot. You are shown the size of each pack and can delete them to manage your storage in the Library tab of the in-app store.  You can redownload packs for free at any time subsequently, so it is not required to hold all the effects on your phone at one time.  We will be extending this ability to customise your library so that you will be able to delete individual effects you&#39;re not using and retain the rest from any given pack.<br /><br />We understand your frustration, but please be reassured that the features you are looking for are being worked on, and will come as a matter of top priority.</p>

Making video clips or GIFs that loop seamlessly is difficult, at best, and Werble makes it easy; import a photo from your camera roll and add pre-built looping elements atop it — things like random graphic design pieces or flames or falling leaves; there are tons of things available (most as IAPs, but no subscription—buy the element once and you can use it as much as you want for as long as you want).  The elements that are included are a great way to get a feel for the app and if you think it’d be worth it to buy other element packs.  For me, it was a no-brainer; many of the element packs are tremendously useful for my work.  (I do media production professionally, and have already found ways to incorporate some of the stuff I build in Werble into my work.)\n\nThis is an easy to use app that makes it fun to build spectacular animations on your favorite iOS device.\n\n(My only complaint about it is that as of now, they only offer square canvases, but I wrote to the developer and they tell me that different aspect ratios are on the way!)","title":"Very Cool Looping GIFs and Videos Made Easy","userName":"SFDex"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1799460398","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2017-09-20T05:54:40Z","developerResponse":{"id":1308857,"body":"Wow - thank you for such an amazing review - we really appreciate your support and it's extremely motivating to read!

I consider it an amazing design tool. We needed this. Artists and designers have searched for exactly this for years. You guys are the only ones who have actually pulled it off. The future is so bright for this software. This will bring forth a new evolution for content creators/designers/artists, marketing, etc. so not only is it an awesome design tool, it’s so much fun!! I hope to see you guys expand the software- I believe this will be a goto tool for designers.\n\nGreat work! I hope to see deeper design options for advanced users, custom text animations, and the ability to export various high resolution video sizes like 16:9 etc. I see this being a great great tool for web designers too. So if we can mask things off and export in a transparent way for the way for the web that would be even cooler. For example animating a logo without a white background having the ability to do it with a transparent background video export would be amazing. \n\nAnyway- I love what you guys have done it’s exciting and so radical.","title":"Amazing- this is development evolution","userName":"Designlove56"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4952089564","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-10-15T18:45:29Z","developerResponse":{"id":13398648,"body":"Hi there,  we are actively working on project save, autosave and undo functionality. These are the priority in terms of the next app features.  In terms of storage, the core app is about 150 MB, and then you are downloading effects to your phone.  We have a lot of effects in the app, so despite compression and other optimisations, you can still download an awful lot. You are shown the size of each pack and can delete them to manage your storage in the Library tab of the in-app store.  You can redownload packs for free at any time subsequently, so it is not required to hold all the effects on your phone at one time.  We will be extending this ability to customise your library so that you will be able to delete individual effects you're not using and retain the rest from any given pack.\n\nWe understand your frustration, but please be reassured that the features you are looking for are being worked on, and will come as a matter of top priority.","modified":"2020-02-10T13:09:18Z"},"rating":1,"review":"This is the greatest app to use for animating your art. I use Werble extensively to create artwork for podcasts on social media. But after emailing the developers more than once for over a year, we are still unable to SAVE our projects within the app! This is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nIf you are designing an animated piece and you go to a different app to find an additional picture to include in your art, Werble can suddenly “refresh” and you lose all your progress with absolutely no way to get it back. What kind of “professional” app is this?!? Checking the app size on my iPhone shows the app uses over 5GB in storage. The cache is all there from every project I’ve made in two years. \n\nLET US SAVE OUR PROJECTS. Stop making new features when the most important one is still missing. I was promised a year ago by the developers that this feature would be “available soon”. Is this a joke? I cannot recommend this app to other artists due to this very simple feature being missing. Also missing is another simple feature: an “undo” option in case you mistakenly move a layer. Scroll through critical reviews on here and witness the developers promising everyone that these features are “coming soon”. Over a year is not considered “coming soon”.","title":"Amazing App With One TERRIBLE Problem","userName":"Brooks Bigley"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1743917866","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2017-08-24T03:03:49Z","developerResponse":{"id":1096661,"body":"Hi Lemondropped - thank you SO much for the thoughtful and kind review 😊 👍.

Werble is not only good, but made me excited to write a review—no nagging required! The UI feels intuitive and is aesthetically pleasing. The ability to add multiple layers and edit each individually makes a huge difference in the final result. Beyond adjusting the lighting, colors, rotation, etc., you can even add animated effects to your animated effects with the pulse feature! Unlike some other apps, you don't have to pay to export your Werble creation in high resolution video or GIF format (what's the point of making it if you can't share it?), and there are plenty of free, high quality animation packs—no sad, tiny sample packs here. The premium packs are reasonably priced if you want them, but you don't need them to make stunning videos and gifs. The cost to permanently remove watermarks is a little higher than other apps of this type I've used, but if my $4 helps the creators continue to develop and grow this app, I'm happy to pay it!

As far as I can tell (feel free to correct me cause I’d rather be wrong) but when you import a picture it crops in.  There is no way to pinch zoom back out to get the entire picture.  You can hold and move to a different part of the image but that’s still not getting the entire image.  Another huge obstacle I found was for photographers who have beautiful pictures on their social media the only way to get those pictures to work with the app is to screenshot it.  Unfortunately....now it will crop in and also when exporting a final creation, it creates a very very low resolution gif and the final image is unusable.  Like it’s really bad...If I could show you the photo you would agree.  No desktop version which I thought maybe I could use to import jpeg images to mess around with but it looks like you are just stuck with your phone library at the moment.  To wrap it up, for fun...sure, maybe but if you are looking to stand out with a quality photo...it’s just not there yet.","title":"Good concept but missing key details","userName":"iamNoahSeth"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3255976779","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-10-02T16:13:13Z","developerResponse":{"id":2706299,"body":"💜 Thank you for the wonderful feedback!

Most of the Werble Community posts their work on Instagram, and are as a whole friendly and will often share their knowledge on how they created certain effects using the app. Most users find themselves so enthralled with using this app and post numerous videos on a daily basis. You can also choose to just use the app for your personal photos as a means to enhance them, or as a way to give your businesses advertising a real kick.

Whether it’s adding fire to my backyard as a Godzilla figure stomps through, or adding dramatic lightning strikes to my Thor figure, this app really enhances my photography. \n\nNow, with such a great app for photos and allowing it to make GIFS to share anywhere, why not take it a step further and allow videos to be edited? I make a lot of toy movies, and I have an upcoming movie project for school. Werble, along with a potential video editor, would allow for so many fun options! One key feature would be tweening. This allows for an effect to move in a video frame by frame wherever you choose. For example, let’s say I have a shot of a forest, panning left to right. I can then mask and tween my effects to stay in their proper place as the camera moves, rather than the effects awkwardly moving with the camera instead. \n\nI’d love for a video editor option to be added soon. I’ve listed just a few features that could be very easily implemented, but you guys over there could always add more fun ideas you think of. I’d say it’d mostly be the same interface, but simply adding tweening to the tools menu. \n\nHopefully you guys at Werble take my idea into consideration.
