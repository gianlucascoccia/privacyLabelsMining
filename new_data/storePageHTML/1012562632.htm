        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Love the app. Since getting a FIRST membership, use it on my iPad to watch AH, RWBY, and anything else.<br /><br />Would love to see these things in later updates:<br /><br />- Better notifications for when live-streams start. I don’t get notified when the RT podcast or Offtopic, and would love to pick what live-streams I want to be notified.<br /><br />- The Achievement Hunter Series tab starts didn’t update to 2019, so it still starts up in 2018.<br /><br />- For some reason, if I watch a video and turn off the phone for a bit, it kicks me out of the app and refreshes it (even with app refresh off). It gets really annoying when I leave the app for a minute and come back to being kicked off a video. <br /><br />- The ability to have downloaded series to be organized by its seasons/years/volumes. Say for RWBY, if I download each episode, it throws them all into a huge list and I have to scroll all the way down for an episode in Vol 6.<br /><br />- Also with downloaded series, the ability to download a series with one button, and NOT having to go and download each episode individually.<br /><br />- Landscape mode! Because since I watch on my iPad, going from watching a video in landscape mode and then having to flip over the iPad/phone to browse.<br /><br />- An iPad app! (one that is made for the iPad instead of having to get the phone version for it).</p>

    Needs better organization

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I think the app is generally laid out well. They very clearly put a thought into how they put things together, however, I feel like they overlooked the organization of some of their content on the app. When you go to look at Let’s Play content, for example, rather than being able to filter by the game they play or what not, you can only filter by year. That means if I want to watch a Minecraft let’s play, I have to scroll through tons of other videos before I can even find one. Sure, I could just search Minecraft, but not being able to filter by games the way they have everything else set up is kind of annoying. I would also love if they added a feature, maybe at least to first members, where we can have a video continue to play picture in picture mode while we, for example, look for another video to watch. Sometimes I would like to search for another video while a video is playing and it’s kind of annoying to have to exit out or preplan what I want to watch. I get that these are nitpicks, but it would really elevate the experience from a meh experience to an amazing one. I love the content and will continue to support, but it’s sad to see that the best place to enjoy their content is on another platform where I can’t support them as a first member.</p>

    Lacklustre 2.0 Rerelease
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>First off I would like to say that the app in its current state has so much potential to be absolutely amazing but it’s missing a huge number of key features that would really seal the deal on 2.0 being better than 1.0 was. I never really used 1.0 because I installed it and it was horrible to even try to use but from what I have read it looks like you removed features from 1.0 to 2.0 which just doesn’t make any sense to me. It looks like you removed both AirPlay support as well as video minimising which neither really make all that much sense to me personally. AirPlay, while not as dire, is a really nice feature that seems like it would only stand to make 2.0 a stunning app. The minimising video is a bit more concerning as that allows users to spend more time curating their upcoming watches. As for features that seem to be no brainers that are missing are things like “double tap to seek”, the ability to swipe between pages, an easy to access watchlist, and a page for new videos from only your favourited series’ are just a few that come to the top of my head. I appreciate the attempt at making your mobile app better but it seems more like a swing and a miss in my personal opinion.</p>

You can modify your information through your account settings, but we may retain your information on an aggregate, non personally-identifiable basis for bona fide business purposes even if you are no longer a registered user or customer.\r\nPlease read this Privacy Policy carefully, along with our Terms of Use and Cookie Policy (collectively, the “Agreement”). By continuing to use our Services, you are expressly consenting to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.\r\nYou further acknowledge that the Services use the YouTube API Services and, as such, you consent to the terms of the Google Privacy Policy.\r\nFinally, we note that California law requires us to provide certain information about how we collect and use the personal information of California residents and to grant those California residents certain rights with respect to their data.  If you are a California resident, please see Section 12 of this Policy for these disclosures and a description of your privacy rights, including a right to access, delete, or opt out of the sale of your personal information.\r\n\r\n1. INTRODUCTION TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY\r\nWe at Rooster Teeth Productions, LLC (“Rooster Teeth,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”, including our parents and affiliates) know that our users care how their personally identifiable information (“Information”) is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and disclose Information when you use any of our Services, including but not limited to:\r\n•\tCompany websites, pages, sites, applications, accounts, or channels accessible through any Internet or wireless enabled device (each, a “Website”);\r\n•\tTicketing and live event gatherings we host or sponsor; and\r\n•\tCompany online platforms and related offerings.\r\nBy visiting or using the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Agreement.\r\nYou must be 18 or older to use our Services. Minors under 18 and at least 13 years of age are only permitted to use our Services through an account owned by a parent or legal guardian with their appropriate permission and under their direct supervision. We do not knowingly collect or solicit Information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Service.\r\n\r\n2. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT\r\nInformation You Provide to Us\r\nYou may not have to create an account to use some of our Services. However if you do choose to create an account and sign up for a Service, we may collect a variety of information from you for that Service based on what you provide to us, such as: name, birth date or age range, gender, and email or physical address. If you are paying for the Service, standard payment and billing information is required. We do not require users to provide their race, ethnicity, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health, sexual orientation or criminal record in their account. Please do not post or add personal data to your account that you would not want to be publicly available.\r\nDepending on which Services you choose to use, additional information may be collected and stored, if necessary in order for us to provide a particular Service. Such information includes:\r\ni.\tbiographical and professional information, association affiliation, demographic data, and financial information;\r\nii.\tinformation responsive to polls or surveys, disclosed in applications for employment, or requested in order to provide information about our business, employment, products or services;\r\niii.\ttransactional information based on your activities on the Website;\r\niv.\tshipping, ordering, billing and other similar information you provide to purchase or ship an item or service;\r\nv.\tcommunity discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through the Website, and correspondence sent to us;\r\nvi.\tcomputer sign-on data, time and date data, statistics on page views, the type of computing environment you use, and traffic to and from the Website (including data about you whenever you interact with the Website, such as when you search, click on links, send messages, make comments, replies or queries, and select best replies);\r\nvii.\tother technical information or data collected from website traffic, including IP address and standard web log information and information gathered from cookies, beacons and other mechanisms;\r\nviii.\tcertain information about your location when you provide it either directly or via device information, such as when you enable your device settings to share your precise location while using out mobile apps or when we derive your general location from device information (such as an IP address);\r\nix.\tsupplemental or additional information we may request from you in the event previous information you’ve provided cannot be verified;\r\nx.\tyour content and any other information that you choose to make available via the Website or that other users of the Website share about you; and\r\nxi.\tother information that you voluntarily provide to us.\r\n\r\nInformation Collected Automatically By Us\r\nWhenever you interact with our Service, we automatically receive and record technical information such as your device, IP address, “cookie” information (as described in our Cookie Policy), the version of your operating system (“OS”), and the page you requested. When you use the Service on a mobile platform, we may also collect and record your unique device ID (persistent / non-persistent), hardware type, media access control (“MAC”) address, international mobile equipment identity (“IMEI”), your device name, and your location (based on your IP address). We may also collect information regarding your activity on the Service (both individually and on an aggregate basis) and your interactions with other users of the Service.\r\n\r\nInformation from Third Parties and Advertisers\r\nWe work with third party advertisers, networks, and service providers who assist us in managing or providing the Service (e.g., payment processors) and who collect some of the information described above. These third parties also help us understand how users interact with our content or offerings. We may also collect contextual or demographic data about our users from third parties, in order to more effectively deliver the Service or content in which we think you would be interested. Unless you have been notified otherwise, all information collected through our authorized third party service providers remains governed by security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Policy and applicable law.\r\n\r\nUsing Other Sites to Login to our Websites or Services\r\nSome users may choose to connect to our Websites or Services using third-party account credentials (for example, your Facebook login or YouTube account). If you choose to connect your account using a third-party account, you understand some of your Information may be shared with us or the respective third-party platform. Your information may also be subject to separate policies of such third-party platform. You should review those policies before providing consent. Connecting your account to third-party applications or services is optional. You can revoke this permission anytime in your account settings.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements\r\nSome of our Services allow advertisers and their networks to collect and use certain anonymous Information about you (e.g. click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) in order to provide advertisements of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit networkadvertising.org.\r\nTo opt out of our own collection, use, and transfer of data as described above for interest-based advertising, click here. Please note that if you opt out here, we will continue to collect data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations. You may continue to receive advertising on our Sites based on your activities on our Sites. \r\n\r\nCookies and Similar Technologies\r\nAs further described in our Cookie Policy, we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixel tags, or other device identifiers) to store login information and recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off, and across different Services and devices. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy.\r\nWe do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals and similar signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.\r\nTo learn more about choices regarding cookies set through the Service, see our Cookie Policy.\r\n\r\nOther\r\nOur Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we use your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n3. WHY WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION\r\nHow we use your Information will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your settings. The primary reason we collect Information is to provide and improve our Services, manage your account and subscription to our Service, and to provide you with a more customized experience on our Services.\r\nThe following is a summary of more specific ways we may use your personal information:\r\n•\tTo provide payment processing and account management, operate, measure and improve our Services, keep our Services safe, secure and operational, and customize Website content\r\n•\tTo contact you regarding your account, to respond to your requests or questions, to troubleshoot problems with your account, to resolve a dispute, to collect fees or monies owed or as otherwise necessary to provide you customer service\r\n•\tTo send you transactional communications. For example, we might send you emails about your purchase or to confirm your registration for an event. We might also contact you about this policy or our website terms\r\n•\tTo provide other services requested by you as described when we collect the Information\r\n•\tFor marketing purposes. For example, we might send you information about events or special promotions. We might also tell you about new features or products. To learn about your choices for these communications, read Section 8.2 below\r\n•\tWe may also use push notifications on our mobile apps to send you various alerts and updates\r\n•\tTo improve our Services, for example by reviewing information associated with stalled or crashed pages experienced by users allowing us to identify and fix problems and give you a better experience\r\n•\tFor security purposes. To prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate fraud, security breaches or other potentially prohibited or illegal activities and/or attempts to harm our users\r\n•\tTo monitor and improve the information security of our Websites and mobile applications\r\n•\tTo enforce our Terms of Use, this Policy, or other policies, and to monitor for violations of our policies or applicable laws\r\nWe also use Information as otherwise described in this Policy, permitted by law, or as we may notify you.\r\n\r\n4. HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED\r\n4.1 Sharing by you\r\nCertain Services offered are social by their very nature, so your participation in such a Service will allow others to see your name and/or username, profile picture, social profile, and any other content you upload or disclose through that profile.\r\n\r\n4.2 Sharing by us\r\nWe share your Information with third parties as listed below, as otherwise described elsewhere in this Policy, or with your consent:\r\n\r\nService Provider\r\nWe employ and allow third parties to perform tasks on our behalf, such as payment processing, data management and analytics, marketing, advertising, communication and IT services, and we need to share your Information with them in order for them to provide such products and services. We generally restrict these third parties from using your Information for purposes such as providing products and services, compliance, and administrative matters such as auditing.\r\n\r\nCompany Affiliates\r\nSubject to applicable laws, we may share your Information with companies with whom the Company is affiliated or related to (e.g., parent company or subsidiaries), and will require such affiliated or related companies to use the Information in a manner consistent with this Policy.\r\n\r\nBusiness Transfers\r\nWe may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer Information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired or merged, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.\r\n\r\nProtection of Company and Others\r\nWe reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, interests, or safety of our Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.\r\n\r\nLegal and Law Enforcement Purposes\r\nWe may disclose information in response to legal process, for example in response to a court order or a subpoena, or in response to a law enforcement agency's request. We also may disclose such information to third parties: (i) in connection with fraud prevention activities, (ii) where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, (iii) in situations that may involve violations of our terms of use or other rules, (iv) to protect our rights and the rights and safety of others, and (v) as otherwise required by law.\r\n\r\nAggregated and Anonymized Information\r\nWe also may share (within our affiliated entities or with third parties) aggregated or anonymized information that does not explicitly identify you or any individual user of our Services. From time to time, the Company may provide demographic and statistical information to prospective partners for the purposes of securing advertising and/or for general promotion of the Service. This disclosure will not share any personal information of individual users but is intended to give a broad overview of the Service’s membership.\r\n\r\n5. THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION\r\nThe security of your Information is important to us. We take commercially reasonable security measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your Information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.\r\nYour account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately. To help protect your Information, you should not share your account information or password, reuse your password on other sites, or use a password you have used on other sites.\r\nWe endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.\r\n\r\n6. WHERE YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE HELD\r\nIn order to provide the Service, the Information that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside of your country and the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and, in particular, the United States. It may also be processed by any service providers appointed by us who operate outside of the EEA and their staff. By submitting your data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing outside of the EEA or your country and acknowledge that not all countries guarantee the same level of protection for your Information as the one in which you reside. Data transferred will be treated in accordance with this Policy and, where applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation.\r\n\r\n7. LAWFUL BASES FOR PROCESSING\r\nWe will only collect and process Information about you where we have lawful bases. Lawful bases include consent (where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the Services you have requested)) and “legitimate interests”.\r\nWhere we process Information based on consent, we will ask for your explicit consent. \r\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, but that will not affect the lawfulness of the processing of your personal data prior to such withdrawal.\r\nWhere we rely on contract, we will ask that you agree to the processing of personal data that is necessary for entering into or performance of your contract with us. We provide a voluntary service; you can choose whether or not you want to use the Services. However, if you want to use the Services, you need to agree to our Terms of Use, which set out the contract between the Company and you. As we operate in countries worldwide (including the US) and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us, we may need to transfer your Information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services.\r\nWhere we rely on legitimate interests as a basis for Information processing, you have the right to object. We may process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests or for the legitimate interests of third parties, provided that such processing shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal Information to:\r\n•\tProtect you, us, or others from threats (such as security threats or fraud)\r\n•\tComply with laws that apply to us\r\n•\tEnable or administer our business, such as for quality control, consolidated reporting, and customer service\r\n•\tManage corporate transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions\r\n•\tUnderstand and improve our business or customer relationships generally\r\n•\tEnable us and our users to connect with each other, view content, express opinions, exchange information, and conduct business\r\nIf you have any questions about the lawful bases upon which we collect and use your Information, please contact our legal department at WMPrivacy@warnermediagroup.com.\r\n\r\n8. WHAT INFORMATION YOU CAN ACCESS\r\nThrough your account settings for the Service, you may access, edit, or delete Information you’ve provided and your record of interactions with the Service. Such Information and interactions, and your ability to update them, will vary based on the Service. \r\nAdditionally, California law grants California residents the right to, among other things, access, delete, and opt out of the sale of certain personal information.  For a description of these rights, please see Section 12 on California and CCPA Privacy Rights and Disclosures. \r\n\r\n8.1 Right to Access and Control Your Information\r\nWe provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your Information.\r\nIndividuals located in certain countries, including the European Economic Area, have certain rights related to their personal Information. Subject to any exemptions provided by law, you may have the right to request the following for personal data that we have about you:\r\n•\tDelete Information: You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you).\r\n•\tChange or Correct Information: You can edit some of your Information through your account. You can also ask us to change, update or fix you Information in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate.\r\n•\tObject to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Information: You can ask us to stop using all or some of your Information (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your Information is inaccurate or unlawfully held).\r\n•\tRight to Access and/or Take Your Information: You can ask us for a copy of your Information and can ask for a copy of Information you provided in machine-readable form.\r\nYou may contact us using the contact information in Section 11 below, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.\r\n\r\n8.2 What Choices You Have\r\nYou can always opt not to disclose Information or to disable certain tools on your browser or device. However, this may limit your ability to fully utilize the Service.\r\nYou may be able to add, update, or delete Information as explained above. When you update Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Information in our records. Please note that some Information may remain in our records for legitimate business reasons even after your deletion of such Information, such as our analyzing aggregated data regarding past usage of the Service (but not in a manner that would identify you personally). Additionally, through Google’s security settings page, you may revoke consent to the use of API Data related to you that was accessed or stored by the Service pursuant to such consent. Company shall delete all such API Data no later than thirty (30) calendar days following such revocation.\r\nYou can opt in to receive mobile push notifications from the Company. If you change your mind later and no longer want to receive these notifications, you can use your device’s settings functionality to turn them off.\r\nIf you don’t want to receive e-mail or other communications from us, you can adjust your email preferences from your account, or opt-out by clicking on the link provided in the emails.\r\nTo learn more about choices regarding cookies set through the Service, see our Cookie Policy.\r\n\r\n8.3 Account Closure\r\nIf you wish to delete your account, you can do so by logging into your account or by emailing us using the contact details provided in Section 11 below. After it is no longer necessary for us to retain your Information, we will dispose of it in a secure manner according to our data retention and deletion policies, except as noted in Section 9 below.\r\nIf at any time you choose to opt out from allowing us to use your Information in the future, contact us directly via email to WMPrivacy@warnermediagroup.com. Upon receipt and process of an opt-out request, we will, within a commercially reasonable period of time, remove your Information from any applicable listings. Note that requests to terminate disclosure to third parties may frustrate or render impossible our ability to provide the Website or conduct transactions initiated by you.\r\n\r\n9. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION\r\nWe generally retain your Information as long as reasonably necessary to provide you the Services or to comply with applicable law. However, even after you deactivate your account, we can retain copies of Information about you and any transactions or Services in which you may have participated for a period of time that is consistent with applicable law, applicable statute of limitations or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, to detect or prevent fraud, to collect fees owed, to resolve disputes, to address problems with our Services, to assist with investigations, to enforce our Terms of Use or other applicable agreements or policies, or to take any other actions consistent with applicable law.\r\nInformation you have shared with others (e.g. through comments or other posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own account, and we do not control data that other users copied out of our Services.\r\n\r\n10. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY\r\nFrom time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use and our Cookie Policy. We will notify you about material changes to this Privacy Policy by placing a notice on our Sites. We encourage you to periodically check back and review this policy so that you always know our current privacy practices.\r\n\r\n11. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding our Policy, please send us a detailed message at the address below, and we will try to resolve your concerns.\r\n\r\nWarnerMedia Privacy Office\r\n4000 Warner Blvd.,\r\nBuilding 160\r\nBurbank, CA 91522\r\nAttn: Privacy / Legal Department\r\n\r\nEmail: WMPrivacy@warnermediagroup.com\r\n\r\n12. YOUR CALIFORNIA AND CCPA PRIVACY RIGHTS AND DISCLOSURES\r\nThis California and CCPA Privacy Rights and Disclosures section was last updated July 1, 2020 and addresses legal obligations and rights laid out in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and other laws that apply only to California residents.

You may be able to opt out of our sharing of your personal information with unaffiliated third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes in certain circumstances. Please send your request (along with your full name, email address, postal address, and the subject line labeled “Your California Privacy Rights”) by email at wmprivacy@warnermediagroup.com.\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you are a California resident, the CCPA grants you the right to request certain information about our practices with respect to California Information. In particular, you can request the following:\r\n•\tThe categories and specific pieces of your California Information that we’ve collected\r\n•\tThe categories of sources from which we collected California Information\r\n•\tThe business or commercial purposes for which we collected or sold California Information\r\n•\tThe categories of third parties with which we shared California Information\r\n\r\nYou can submit a request to us for the following additional information:\r\n•\tThe categories of third parties to whom we’ve sold California Information, and the category or categories of California Information sold to each\r\n•\tThe categories of third parties to whom we’ve disclosed California Information, and the category or categories of California Information disclosed to each \r\n\r\nYOUR RIGHT TO REQUEST THE DELETION OF CALIFORNIA INFORMATION\r\n\r\nUpon your request, we will delete the California Information we have collected about you, except for situations when that information is necessary for us to: provide you with a product or service that you requested; perform a contract we entered into with you; maintain the functionality or security of our systems; comply with or exercise rights provided by the law; or use the information internally in ways that are compatible with the context in which you provided the information to us, or that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us.\r\n\r\nYOUR RIGHT TO ASK US NOT TO SELL YOUR CALIFORNIA INFORMATION\r\n\r\nYou can always tell us not to sell your California Information by visiting here and following the instructions.\r\n\r\nHOW TO EXERCISE YOUR CALIFORNIA RIGHTS\r\nYou may exercise your rights to request access to your California Information, deletion of your California, or to request we not sell your California Information by visiting our Privacy Center here.  You can also contact us toll free at 833-WM-PRVCY (833-967-7829) or TTY: 833-PRVCY-TT (833-778-2988) and an agent will assist you with submitting a request.  These requests are generally free. When you submit a request, we will usually ask you to provide an email address which we will contact to confirm the request was not fraudulently submitted.  \r\nIn addition, for access and deletion requests, we will use a third-party verification service to confirm that you are who you say you are.  Our verification service does this by matching information you provide against information held about you in its records, or, if necessary, by allowing you to submit documents proving your identity.\r\n\r\nIf you are the parent of a child under 13 years of age, you may also submit a request on behalf of your child.  In that event, we will ask you to provide your child’s email address, to verify your identity, and to submit a signed form authorizing us to proceed with the request regarding your child’s California Information. \r\n\r\nYou may also designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf.  To do so, we will require either (1) a valid power of attorney, or (2) signed written permission from you.  In the event your authorized agent is relying on signed written permission, we may also need to verify your identity and/or contact you directly to confirm permission to proceed with the request.\r\n\r\nYour authorized agent can make a request by contacting us toll free at 833-WM-PRVCY (833-967-7829) or TTY: 833-PRVCY-TT (833-778-2988).\r\n\r\nOUR SUPPORT FOR THE EXERCISE YOUR DATA RIGHTS\r\n\r\nYou have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment if you exercise any of the rights explained in this section of the Privacy Policy.  We are committed to providing you control over your California Information, we will not disadvantage you if you choose to exercise your rights.  \r\n\r\nCONSUMERS UNDER 16 YEARS OLD\r\n\r\nCCPA has specific rules regarding the use of California Information from consumers under 16 years of age.  In particular, consistent with the CCPA, if we knowingly collect the California Information of a consumer under the age of 16, we will not sell the information unless we receive affirmative permission to do so.  If the consumer is between the ages of 13 and 16 years of age, the consumer may provide that permission; if the consumer is under the age of 13, the consumer’s parent or guardian must provide the permission. As of the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy, we do not have actual knowledge that we sell California Information of consumers under 16 years of age. \r\n\r\nIf you would like further information on how we handle California Information from consumers under the age of 16 years of age, or if you have questions about these information practices, you may contact us at wmprivacy@warnermediagroup.com, or at WarnerMedia Privacy Office, 4000 Warner Blvd., Bldg. 160, Burbank, CA 91522.\r\n\r\nCONSUMERS UNDER 18 YEARS OLD\r\n\r\nCalifornia consumers who are registered users of the Sites and under 18 years of age may request removal of content or information they posted on the Sites.

You can modify your information through your account settings, but we may retain your information on an aggregate, non personally-identifiable basis for bona fide business purposes even if you are no longer a registered user or customer.\r\nPlease read this Privacy Policy carefully, along with our Terms of Use and Cookie Policy (collectively, the “Agreement”). By continuing to use our Services, you are expressly consenting to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.\r\nYou further acknowledge that the Services use the YouTube API Services and, as such, you consent to the terms of the Google Privacy Policy.\r\nFinally, we note that California law requires us to provide certain information about how we collect and use the personal information of California residents and to grant those California residents certain rights with respect to their data.  If you are a California resident, please see Section 12 of this Policy for these disclosures and a description of your privacy rights, including a right to access, delete, or opt out of the sale of your personal information.\r\n\r\n1. INTRODUCTION TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY\r\nWe at Rooster Teeth Productions, LLC (“Rooster Teeth,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”, including our parents and affiliates) know that our users care how their personally identifiable information (“Information”) is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and disclose Information when you use any of our Services, including but not limited to:\r\n•\tCompany websites, pages, sites, applications, accounts, or channels accessible through any Internet or wireless enabled device (each, a “Website”);\r\n•\tTicketing and live event gatherings we host or sponsor; and\r\n•\tCompany online platforms and related offerings.\r\nBy visiting or using the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Agreement.\r\nYou must be 18 or older to use our Services. Minors under 18 and at least 13 years of age are only permitted to use our Services through an account owned by a parent or legal guardian with their appropriate permission and under their direct supervision. We do not knowingly collect or solicit Information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Service.\r\n\r\n2. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT\r\nInformation You Provide to Us\r\nYou may not have to create an account to use some of our Services. However if you do choose to create an account and sign up for a Service, we may collect a variety of information from you for that Service based on what you provide to us, such as: name, birth date or age range, gender, and email or physical address. If you are paying for the Service, standard payment and billing information is required. We do not require users to provide their race, ethnicity, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health, sexual orientation or criminal record in their account. Please do not post or add personal data to your account that you would not want to be publicly available.\r\nDepending on which Services you choose to use, additional information may be collected and stored, if necessary in order for us to provide a particular Service. Such information includes:\r\ni.\tbiographical and professional information, association affiliation, demographic data, and financial information;\r\nii.\tinformation responsive to polls or surveys, disclosed in applications for employment, or requested in order to provide information about our business, employment, products or services;\r\niii.\ttransactional information based on your activities on the Website;\r\niv.\tshipping, ordering, billing and other similar information you provide to purchase or ship an item or service;\r\nv.\tcommunity discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through the Website, and correspondence sent to us;\r\nvi.\tcomputer sign-on data, time and date data, statistics on page views, the type of computing environment you use, and traffic to and from the Website (including data about you whenever you interact with the Website, such as when you search, click on links, send messages, make comments, replies or queries, and select best replies);\r\nvii.\tother technical information or data collected from website traffic, including IP address and standard web log information and information gathered from cookies, beacons and other mechanisms;\r\nviii.\tcertain information about your location when you provide it either directly or via device information, such as when you enable your device settings to share your precise location while using out mobile apps or when we derive your general location from device information (such as an IP address);\r\nix.\tsupplemental or additional information we may request from you in the event previous information you’ve provided cannot be verified;\r\nx.\tyour content and any other information that you choose to make available via the Website or that other users of the Website share about you; and\r\nxi.\tother information that you voluntarily provide to us.\r\n\r\nInformation Collected Automatically By Us\r\nWhenever you interact with our Service, we automatically receive and record technical information such as your device, IP address, “cookie” information (as described in our Cookie Policy), the version of your operating system (“OS”), and the page you requested. When you use the Service on a mobile platform, we may also collect and record your unique device ID (persistent / non-persistent), hardware type, media access control (“MAC”) address, international mobile equipment identity (“IMEI”), your device name, and your location (based on your IP address). We may also collect information regarding your activity on the Service (both individually and on an aggregate basis) and your interactions with other users of the Service.\r\n\r\nInformation from Third Parties and Advertisers\r\nWe work with third party advertisers, networks, and service providers who assist us in managing or providing the Service (e.g., payment processors) and who collect some of the information described above. These third parties also help us understand how users interact with our content or offerings. We may also collect contextual or demographic data about our users from third parties, in order to more effectively deliver the Service or content in which we think you would be interested. Unless you have been notified otherwise, all information collected through our authorized third party service providers remains governed by security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Policy and applicable law.\r\n\r\nUsing Other Sites to Login to our Websites or Services\r\nSome users may choose to connect to our Websites or Services using third-party account credentials (for example, your Facebook login or YouTube account). If you choose to connect your account using a third-party account, you understand some of your Information may be shared with us or the respective third-party platform. Your information may also be subject to separate policies of such third-party platform. You should review those policies before providing consent. Connecting your account to third-party applications or services is optional. You can revoke this permission anytime in your account settings.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements\r\nSome of our Services allow advertisers and their networks to collect and use certain anonymous Information about you (e.g. click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) in order to provide advertisements of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit networkadvertising.org.\r\nTo opt out of our own collection, use, and transfer of data as described above for interest-based advertising, click here. Please note that if you opt out here, we will continue to collect data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations. You may continue to receive advertising on our Sites based on your activities on our Sites. \r\n\r\nCookies and Similar Technologies\r\nAs further described in our Cookie Policy, we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixel tags, or other device identifiers) to store login information and recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off, and across different Services and devices. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy.\r\nWe do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals and similar signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.\r\nTo learn more about choices regarding cookies set through the Service, see our Cookie Policy.\r\n\r\nOther\r\nOur Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we use your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n3. WHY WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION\r\nHow we use your Information will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your settings. The primary reason we collect Information is to provide and improve our Services, manage your account and subscription to our Service, and to provide you with a more customized experience on our Services.\r\nThe following is a summary of more specific ways we may use your personal information:\r\n•\tTo provide payment processing and account management, operate, measure and improve our Services, keep our Services safe, secure and operational, and customize Website content\r\n•\tTo contact you regarding your account, to respond to your requests or questions, to troubleshoot problems with your account, to resolve a dispute, to collect fees or monies owed or as otherwise necessary to provide you customer service\r\n•\tTo send you transactional communications. For example, we might send you emails about your purchase or to confirm your registration for an event. We might also contact you about this policy or our website terms\r\n•\tTo provide other services requested by you as described when we collect the Information\r\n•\tFor marketing purposes. For example, we might send you information about events or special promotions. We might also tell you about new features or products. To learn about your choices for these communications, read Section 8.2 below\r\n•\tWe may also use push notifications on our mobile apps to send you various alerts and updates\r\n•\tTo improve our Services, for example by reviewing information associated with stalled or crashed pages experienced by users allowing us to identify and fix problems and give you a better experience\r\n•\tFor security purposes. To prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate fraud, security breaches or other potentially prohibited or illegal activities and/or attempts to harm our users\r\n•\tTo monitor and improve the information security of our Websites and mobile applications\r\n•\tTo enforce our Terms of Use, this Policy, or other policies, and to monitor for violations of our policies or applicable laws\r\nWe also use Information as otherwise described in this Policy, permitted by law, or as we may notify you.\r\n\r\n4. HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED\r\n4.1 Sharing by you\r\nCertain Services offered are social by their very nature, so your participation in such a Service will allow others to see your name and/or username, profile picture, social profile, and any other content you upload or disclose through that profile.\r\n\r\n4.2 Sharing by us\r\nWe share your Information with third parties as listed below, as otherwise described elsewhere in this Policy, or with your consent:\r\n\r\nService Provider\r\nWe employ and allow third parties to perform tasks on our behalf, such as payment processing, data management and analytics, marketing, advertising, communication and IT services, and we need to share your Information with them in order for them to provide such products and services. We generally restrict these third parties from using your Information for purposes such as providing products and services, compliance, and administrative matters such as auditing.\r\n\r\nCompany Affiliates\r\nSubject to applicable laws, we may share your Information with companies with whom the Company is affiliated or related to (e.g., parent company or subsidiaries), and will require such affiliated or related companies to use the Information in a manner consistent with this Policy.\r\n\r\nBusiness Transfers\r\nWe may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer Information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired or merged, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.\r\n\r\nProtection of Company and Others\r\nWe reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, interests, or safety of our Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.\r\n\r\nLegal and Law Enforcement Purposes\r\nWe may disclose information in response to legal process, for example in response to a court order or a subpoena, or in response to a law enforcement agency's request. We also may disclose such information to third parties: (i) in connection with fraud prevention activities, (ii) where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, (iii) in situations that may involve violations of our terms of use or other rules, (iv) to protect our rights and the rights and safety of others, and (v) as otherwise required by law.\r\n\r\nAggregated and Anonymized Information\r\nWe also may share (within our affiliated entities or with third parties) aggregated or anonymized information that does not explicitly identify you or any individual user of our Services. From time to time, the Company may provide demographic and statistical information to prospective partners for the purposes of securing advertising and/or for general promotion of the Service. This disclosure will not share any personal information of individual users but is intended to give a broad overview of the Service’s membership.\r\n\r\n5. THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION\r\nThe security of your Information is important to us. We take commercially reasonable security measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your Information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.\r\nYour account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately. To help protect your Information, you should not share your account information or password, reuse your password on other sites, or use a password you have used on other sites.\r\nWe endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.\r\n\r\n6. WHERE YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE HELD\r\nIn order to provide the Service, the Information that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside of your country and the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and, in particular, the United States. It may also be processed by any service providers appointed by us who operate outside of the EEA and their staff. By submitting your data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing outside of the EEA or your country and acknowledge that not all countries guarantee the same level of protection for your Information as the one in which you reside. Data transferred will be treated in accordance with this Policy and, where applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation.\r\n\r\n7. LAWFUL BASES FOR PROCESSING\r\nWe will only collect and process Information about you where we have lawful bases. Lawful bases include consent (where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the Services you have requested)) and “legitimate interests”.\r\nWhere we process Information based on consent, we will ask for your explicit consent. \r\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, but that will not affect the lawfulness of the processing of your personal data prior to such withdrawal.\r\nWhere we rely on contract, we will ask that you agree to the processing of personal data that is necessary for entering into or performance of your contract with us. We provide a voluntary service; you can choose whether or not you want to use the Services. However, if you want to use the Services, you need to agree to our Terms of Use, which set out the contract between the Company and you. As we operate in countries worldwide (including the US) and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us, we may need to transfer your Information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services.\r\nWhere we rely on legitimate interests as a basis for Information processing, you have the right to object. We may process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests or for the legitimate interests of third parties, provided that such processing shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal Information to:\r\n•\tProtect you, us, or others from threats (such as security threats or fraud)\r\n•\tComply with laws that apply to us\r\n•\tEnable or administer our business, such as for quality control, consolidated reporting, and customer service\r\n•\tManage corporate transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions\r\n•\tUnderstand and improve our business or customer relationships generally\r\n•\tEnable us and our users to connect with each other, view content, express opinions, exchange information, and conduct business\r\nIf you have any questions about the lawful bases upon which we collect and use your Information, please contact our legal department at WMPrivacy@warnermediagroup.com.\r\n\r\n8. WHAT INFORMATION YOU CAN ACCESS\r\nThrough your account settings for the Service, you may access, edit, or delete Information you’ve provided and your record of interactions with the Service. Such Information and interactions, and your ability to update them, will vary based on the Service. \r\nAdditionally, California law grants California residents the right to, among other things, access, delete, and opt out of the sale of certain personal information.  For a description of these rights, please see Section 12 on California and CCPA Privacy Rights and Disclosures. \r\n\r\n8.1 Right to Access and Control Your Information\r\nWe provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your Information.\r\nIndividuals located in certain countries, including the European Economic Area, have certain rights related to their personal Information. Subject to any exemptions provided by law, you may have the right to request the following for personal data that we have about you:\r\n•\tDelete Information: You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you).\r\n•\tChange or Correct Information: You can edit some of your Information through your account. You can also ask us to change, update or fix you Information in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate.\r\n•\tObject to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Information: You can ask us to stop using all or some of your Information (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your Information is inaccurate or unlawfully held).\r\n•\tRight to Access and/or Take Your Information: You can ask us for a copy of your Information and can ask for a copy of Information you provided in machine-readable form.\r\nYou may contact us using the contact information in Section 11 below, and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.\r\n\r\n8.2 What Choices You Have\r\nYou can always opt not to disclose Information or to disable certain tools on your browser or device. However, this may limit your ability to fully utilize the Service.\r\nYou may be able to add, update, or delete Information as explained above. When you update Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Information in our records. Please note that some Information may remain in our records for legitimate business reasons even after your deletion of such Information, such as our analyzing aggregated data regarding past usage of the Service (but not in a manner that would identify you personally). Additionally, through Google’s security settings page, you may revoke consent to the use of API Data related to you that was accessed or stored by the Service pursuant to such consent. Company shall delete all such API Data no later than thirty (30) calendar days following such revocation.\r\nYou can opt in to receive mobile push notifications from the Company. If you change your mind later and no longer want to receive these notifications, you can use your device’s settings functionality to turn them off.\r\nIf you don’t want to receive e-mail or other communications from us, you can adjust your email preferences from your account, or opt-out by clicking on the link provided in the emails.\r\nTo learn more about choices regarding cookies set through the Service, see our Cookie Policy.\r\n\r\n8.3 Account Closure\r\nIf you wish to delete your account, you can do so by logging into your account or by emailing us using the contact details provided in Section 11 below. After it is no longer necessary for us to retain your Information, we will dispose of it in a secure manner according to our data retention and deletion policies, except as noted in Section 9 below.\r\nIf at any time you choose to opt out from allowing us to use your Information in the future, contact us directly via email to WMPrivacy@warnermediagroup.com. Upon receipt and process of an opt-out request, we will, within a commercially reasonable period of time, remove your Information from any applicable listings. Note that requests to terminate disclosure to third parties may frustrate or render impossible our ability to provide the Website or conduct transactions initiated by you.\r\n\r\n9. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION\r\nWe generally retain your Information as long as reasonably necessary to provide you the Services or to comply with applicable law. However, even after you deactivate your account, we can retain copies of Information about you and any transactions or Services in which you may have participated for a period of time that is consistent with applicable law, applicable statute of limitations or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, to detect or prevent fraud, to collect fees owed, to resolve disputes, to address problems with our Services, to assist with investigations, to enforce our Terms of Use or other applicable agreements or policies, or to take any other actions consistent with applicable law.\r\nInformation you have shared with others (e.g. through comments or other posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own account, and we do not control data that other users copied out of our Services.\r\n\r\n10. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY\r\nFrom time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use and our Cookie Policy. We will notify you about material changes to this Privacy Policy by placing a notice on our Sites. We encourage you to periodically check back and review this policy so that you always know our current privacy practices.\r\n\r\n11. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding our Policy, please send us a detailed message at the address below, and we will try to resolve your concerns.\r\n\r\nWarnerMedia Privacy Office\r\n4000 Warner Blvd.,\r\nBuilding 160\r\nBurbank, CA 91522\r\nAttn: Privacy / Legal Department\r\n\r\nEmail: WMPrivacy@warnermediagroup.com\r\n\r\n12. YOUR CALIFORNIA AND CCPA PRIVACY RIGHTS AND DISCLOSURES\r\nThis California and CCPA Privacy Rights and Disclosures section was last updated July 1, 2020 and addresses legal obligations and rights laid out in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and other laws that apply only to California residents.

They very clearly put a thought into how they put things together, however, I feel like they overlooked the organization of some of their content on the app. When you go to look at Let’s Play content, for example, rather than being able to filter by the game they play or what not, you can only filter by year. That means if I want to watch a Minecraft let’s play, I have to scroll through tons of other videos before I can even find one. Sure, I could just search Minecraft, but not being able to filter by games the way they have everything else set up is kind of annoying. I would also love if they added a feature, maybe at least to first members, where we can have a video continue to play picture in picture mode while we, for example, look for another video to watch. Sometimes I would like to search for another video while a video is playing and it’s kind of annoying to have to exit out or preplan what I want to watch. I get that these are nitpicks, but it would really elevate the experience from a meh experience to an amazing one.

I never really used 1.0 because I installed it and it was horrible to even try to use but from what I have read it looks like you removed features from 1.0 to 2.0 which just doesn’t make any sense to me. It looks like you removed both AirPlay support as well as video minimising which neither really make all that much sense to me personally. AirPlay, while not as dire, is a really nice feature that seems like it would only stand to make 2.0 a stunning app. The minimising video is a bit more concerning as that allows users to spend more time curating their upcoming watches. As for features that seem to be no brainers that are missing are things like “double tap to seek”, the ability to swipe between pages, an easy to access watchlist, and a page for new videos from only your favourited series’ are just a few that come to the top of my head.

First, it is logging me out randomly MUCH more frequently now. This wouldn’t be so bad but it all stopped interfacing with password managers too. This may have been when they introduced signing on with google, but I can’t be sure. Because I understand network security I have a STRONG password so now I have to go into LastPass, look up my password, copy it to the clipboard, come back into the RT app, and paste it. I just wanted to watch funny internet videos and your app made it into this whole big thing.\n\nSecond, how is there still no iPad version of the app. It has been out for how long, this is absurd!!! Yes, I can use the iPhone version on my iPad and zoom it to fill the screen, but it looks terrible.\n\nThird, and this really chafes me because it used to work. I cannot play and pause using my AirPods or my Apple Watch.

I normally use this app by airplaying the video to my Apple TV, since the Apple TV rooster teeth app is trash. Now, I have to mirror my whole screen in order to do so. Secondly, I'd like the ability to minimize the player so I can browse comments or the rest of the app while the video is still playing. Both of these features were on the older version of the app that have since been removed during this re-vamp. \n\nOne more thing and this one is minor. Id like the ability to just swipe right to backwards thru the app. I.E.: from the main screen, tapping achievement Hunter to see the list of just their vids, and then swiping back to the main screen instead of tapping the tiny arrow in the corner.

I'll be looking for a video in the app that I saw on my computer and I can't find it even though it's still on the site when I open it on my computer. \n-There's just a lot of general bugs that make navigation and operation difficult.

I’ve been getting this issue where videos won’t show up in the feed and I have to go hunt down my weekly videos. The app also doesn’t save your progress on a video if you stop watching which is a pain, the buffering is also a pain since there is no circle or button to help drag the video along. This is a huge shame since I only watch RT content on this app and will probably be the reason I end my subscription since YouTube’s app is so far above and better then this poor excuse from an otherwise great company.

Also, every time I try to add something to my watchlist, it says there’s an error and to try again later. Still not working. Really hoping someone at Rooster Teeth sees this and addresses those bugs or I will not be continuing the First membership. Don’t see a point in using the app if none of my videos have audio.

It would be really great if they could get the apps, especially the Xbox version, to work more than 40% of the time. Half the time when I click on any video it doesn’t load at all. I’ve tried staring at the black screen for 10+ minutes thinking it’s just buffering, closing and reopening the app a dozen times, deleting and reinstalling the app altogether but to avail. It would be nice not to have to go through the trouble of hooking my laptop up to my TV every time I want to rewatch my favorite moments\nfrom RWBY vol 6.
