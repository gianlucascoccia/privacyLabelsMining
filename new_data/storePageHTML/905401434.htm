        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>And I’ve tried them all.<br /><br />I chose DTVNow when I cut the cord.  What I didn’t count on was that the app was constantly glitchy, their prices went up, they changed their packages, and didn’t offer a lot of the channels I like.   I was willing to stick with them in the name of cord cutting, but then I came across Fubo more or less by accident.  I don’t care about sports channels so Fubo never seemed like an option for me.  But when I tried them out for a week with their free trial offer I was pleasantly surprised.  Fubo is a much more stable platform than DTVNow and I’m really impressed with the channels they offer - especially since they only charge $4/month more than DTVNow for a bigger selection.  That’s $4 well spent imo.<br /><br />My two suggestions to make the Fubo experience on Roku perfect is to add a “last channel” feature so that you can quickly flip back and forth between two channels.  Also, I’m not super impressed with how the networks are laid out on the home screen or in the guide.  It seems a very random order, even after you pick your favorites.  It would be much better to have the networks alphabetized so that they’re easier to find.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>On around February 27th 2020 I decided to switch from SlingTV to FuboTV. I went with the Latino package so I could watch La Liga and EUFA Champions League for which I had to pay 3 months in advance ( 60$ ). Around 2 weeks into my membership coronavirus started spreading fast and matches were postponed with no further notice, I only got to watch 2 games. Now Obviously this is not FuboTV’s fault and I wouldn’t expect or ask for a refund. I called Customer service and all I asked was for my prepaid time to be put on hold until matches started again but they said they couldn’t do that, they told me that there was other stuff I could watch after I had already said that I only got my membership to watch soccer games. I asked if I could at least get an extra month for free, they said no. I told them I didn’t want to cancel and that I understood that I was going to have a loss because we we all impacted by the virus in some way or another, all I wanted was for them to take some of the loss not just me the customer. After talking on the phone with a representative for maybe 10min ( he was a very nice guy ) i knew that we weren’t going anywhere so I emailed corporate. They responded saying the same thing, that there was nothing they could do, I replied and they never replied again. <br />I think I was being pretty reasonable, I wasn’t asking for much just a portion of what I paid for. Those 2 games cost me 60$. I cancelled my account.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I left sling tv for you guys and I’ve been with you for the last 9 months! I’ve really enjoyed your service! Customer support by far the best I’ve seen in a while anywhere! Really quick to answer questions and help with any issues! I’m totally hooked and the fact you guys keep getting bigger and bigger and adding more and more channels means I’ve made a good move and feel really good about it! Happy to see you guys keep on keeping on the good work! The channels I’m happy to see on here are MavTV, Motor Trend, FX, FXM, FXX, Showetime, FS1, FS2, History, Discovery, almost all the local channels, and the weather channel and so on exc.... you guys have more channels then any of the other streaming tv providers! Only thing I’d like to see added are these channels.. ESPN networks, (including ABC) Disney, and more premium channels.. like HBO, Cinemax, Starz, and Epix! Other then that, I’m very happy! Prices are reasonable for what you offer on top of all the on-demand sports, series, and movies you offer!! I definitely plan to stay a while without a doubt! Thanks again for the awesome service guys!!! 😁👍</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi there. Thanks for the wonderful feedback and support and please keep the suggestions coming! We&#39;re always looking to add new content to our platform so hopefully in the near future, we&#39;ll be able to offer the Disney line of channels as well as some of those other premium channels you&#39;re looking for. Feel free to check in with us from time to time to see if we have any updates on any of those channels but for now, thanks for your loyalty. If you ever need anything in the future, please don&#39;t hesitate to reach out to us, we&#39;re always happy to help.</p>

If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Services or any features, activities or services offered through the Services. This Privacy Policy applies regardless of the Device you use to access the Services and whether you are accessing the Services as a registered User or otherwise.\n\nGENERAL.\nThis Privacy Policy governs only the information (i) collected by us from you and/or (ii) provided to us by a third party platform (e.g., Facebook, Apple (iTunes, etc.), Twitter, etc.) (a “ Third Party Platform ”) about you, in each instance, on or in connection with your use of the Services, and does not cover any other information collected in any other manner or collected by any other entity, unless specifically stated. We may combine your Information (as defined herein) with other information we collect from other sources, such as information you have provided to third parties, including, but not limited to, our affiliated companies, marketing companies or Advertisers and have provided sufficient consent, and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.\n\nWhen we use the term “ Personal Information ” we mean any information that we collect on or in connection with the Services that would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address or telephone number. When we use the term “ Additional Information”, we mean any information that we collect on or in connection with the Services other than Personal Information, such as your videos viewed, players or team preferences, etc. (Personal Information and Additional Information will be collectively referred to as “ Information”).\n\nINFORMATION WE COLLECT.\nUser Registration, Features, Functions and Communications. In order to access and use certain features, content or functions, of the Services, you may be asked to provide and/or make available (e.g., via Third Party Platform permissions and consents, etc.) certain Information, including, but not limited to, in connection with registration features, in order to personalize and/or allow you to use these features and functions.

What I didn’t count on was that the app was constantly glitchy, their prices went up, they changed their packages, and didn’t offer a lot of the channels I like.   I was willing to stick with them in the name of cord cutting, but then I came across Fubo more or less by accident.  I don’t care about sports channels so Fubo never seemed like an option for me.  But when I tried them out for a week with their free trial offer I was pleasantly surprised.  Fubo is a much more stable platform than DTVNow and I’m really impressed with the channels they offer - especially since they only charge $4/month more than DTVNow for a bigger selection.  That’s $4 well spent imo.\n\nMy two suggestions to make the Fubo experience on Roku perfect is to add a “last channel” feature so that you can quickly flip back and forth between two channels.  Also, I’m not super impressed with how the networks are laid out on the home screen or in the guide.  It seems a very random order, even after you pick your favorites.  It would be much better to have the networks alphabetized so that they’re easier to find.","title":"Best streaming service I’ve seen","userName":"Caa1970"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6043193775","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-06T15:41:47Z","developerResponse":{"id":15823083,"body":"Hi Pablo,\n\nWe are sad to see you go!

I went with the Latino package so I could watch La Liga and EUFA Champions League for which I had to pay 3 months in advance ( 60$ ). Around 2 weeks into my membership coronavirus started spreading fast and matches were postponed with no further notice, I only got to watch 2 games. Now Obviously this is not FuboTV’s fault and I wouldn’t expect or ask for a refund. I called Customer service and all I asked was for my prepaid time to be put on hold until matches started again but they said they couldn’t do that, they told me that there was other stuff I could watch after I had already said that I only got my membership to watch soccer games. I asked if I could at least get an extra month for free, they said no. I told them I didn’t want to cancel and that I understood that I was going to have a loss because we we all impacted by the virus in some way or another, all I wanted was for them to take some of the loss not just me the customer. After talking on the phone with a representative for maybe 10min ( he was a very nice guy ) i knew that we weren’t going anywhere so I emailed corporate. They responded saying the same thing, that there was nothing they could do, I replied and they never replied again. \nI think I was being pretty reasonable, I wasn’t asking for much just a portion of what I paid for. Those 2 games cost me 60$. I cancelled my account.","title":"Good App Not a Great Company","userName":"pablosantoss"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4494393964","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-07-21T00:52:52Z","developerResponse":{"id":9807899,"body":"Hi there.

I especially like the record option to watch scheduled shows on my terms. But what really amazes me is the ability to watch a show that has aired previously before I set up the “record series “ option. What I mean is I wanted to watch a show called “The Curse of the Civil War Gold” and I set up to record the series. But I had already missed the previous 4-5 episodes. I could search for the show and select it and hit play. Thus watching the previous shows through the history channel app. It did this without having to exit FuboTV and go into History app. Perfect for me so far!\n\nThe only thing I wish it had was a indicator in the guide section that indicated a show is already set up to record or if it was already set up to record the series.

Channel lineup has everything except ESPN and Disney and my husband likes NESN and doesn’t miss ESPN.  I have all the news and movie channels I like to watch.  One thing I really appreciate is that if there is a break in the stream, it reloads to where you were, or a little before where you were so you don’t miss part of the episode. Right now the only glitch we have is that when we have the tv and my iPad on, I will sometimes get a “too many devices” msg but it doesn’t boot me out. It only happens with one of the two TVs we have and I suspect it may be because of the age of the tv tweaks something in the software program. I’m hoping that Fubo will soon add the ability to go to the last station without going back to the guide, but I’m sure they’ll continue to add options.","title":"Much better than DTVNOW","userName":"Ilikestreaming"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5343705968","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-12-31T18:40:56Z","rating":4,"review":"It has gotten better since I started with FUBO this past summer. For several months it was 1 issue after another - the frustrating kind. Most of the time the screen would Freeze \u0026 then I’d lose content. The other main problem was the voice wasn’t in sync with screen, video freezes. The later still continues but much less than before. One problem I don’t like that I really enjoyed with Spectrum was the amount of video recording allotted space. AND I DIDN’T PAY AN EXCESS AMOUNT TO DO RECORDiNG’s. There was plenty of storage by Spectrum BUT, WITH FUBO YOU ONLY GET 30 HOURS. WITH THAT LOW NUMBER YOU CAN ONKT STORE A FEW MOVIES, ESPECIALLY DURING HOLIDAYS. I’M RETIRED \u0026 CANT AFFORD EXCESSIVE MONTHLY FEES. PLEASE INCREASE THE AMOUNT, AT LEAST TO SENIORS. If I was working I’d have no problem with the cost. I’m in my late 70’s \u0026 TV MOVIES \u0026 SPECIAL WERKLY SERIES are my favorite shows to watch, but with Dr Appts, Physical Therapy \u0026 Choir Practice I miss many of my special shows \u0026 then recording space becomes limited. Love FUBO but would enjoy it more if I had more recording space. Thanks for listening!!","title":"Great!

They replied and had an update for me the next morning not even a full 24 hours later. Fully fixed my issue. Kudos to their team for taking care of my issue with the quickness. Only reason for not giving 5⭐️ is cause I had an issue to begin with. Would give 4.5 ⭐️s if I could since they handled it on the fly. Gave the next best thing, 4⭐️. Would totes recommend to an Fút, soccer, footy fans for sure. They offer that and them some.

About a year ago they lost FX networks and after months they returned now recently they have lost lifetime and several other popular channels. So twice in a years time multiple popular channels have disappeared with only a very few coming back. Fubo doesn’t want to cut the price of service despite loosing channels and the service seems to give you the huddle up we’re having issues from the source we’re working on it many times daily. The service has gotten to the point of not worth what you pay. The company keeps rocking in stocks so they could lower the cost or pay what the broadcasters want to keep them, I could care less how much the CEO makes but without customers he will loose money. Leave the channels alone and stop being cheap and trying to pay them less people choose you for what you offer they leave you if you stop offering what they need.

I attempted to cancel my service the day before I was charged over the phone but there is an issue where the the automated service will list you off numbered options but no matter what number you press the automated service just repeats itself.  After about 7 or so attempts I figured I would try again in the morning.  I call back (now with my bank account charged) and after a few more attempts out of aggravation I press the number repeatedly and to my surprise I’m finally put through to an actual person.  Upon explaining my issue I had with their phone service and the rest of the details I am informed that I can cancel but cannot receive a refund because there was no attempt online to cancel.  After explaining that even Apple was unable to help me via customer service I was issued the same response.  These penny pinching practices and inability to own up to a flaw in their customer service system that cost me money shows me this service although useful as a whole does not care about their customers but more so about money.","title":"Customer service issue","userName":"Randall37"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4603076727","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-08-11T18:45:09Z","developerResponse":{"id":715914,"body":"Hi there,\n\nWe are so sorry to hear that you experienced issues with our DVR feature.

Nothing. I had been getting an automaton robot sending the same doomsday 'problem with your card...' and says to 'log in to update' and that's it. No response to emails. See, the card problem is a card REPLACEMENT from the bank- it has a new expiration date. I've had this app for so long that it was linked to an OLD work email and so the robot email (which sends to a GOOD CURRENT EMAIL ADDRESS) has ZERO ability to work to resolve the problem. \nToo bad. If they can't be bothered to answer customers issues with simply TRYING TO HAND THEM MONEY... there's always competition that will try to. \nI'm currently on hold with customer service and my 'channel package' price has 'disappeared' somehow! They offered me a package price with a jump from $120/ year to $660/ year!!! All because they managed to dodge the request for customer service for a few weeks! ...45 min of arguing with customer service managed to get it to $240/ year!
