        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>You do have to pay for the subscription to get a lot out of this app but it’s completely worth it. <br />The exercise bank is extensive and I have been able to find every exercise I do, or something very close to it. It’s surprising how much this app will track for you - calories, time, total weight, and best of all is viewing your workouts at the end of each day or at the end of the week on the chart that shows how well you worked each muscle group. <br />The only complaint I might have is that sometimes the buttons are slow to respond but I don’t care much. This app is a great motivator.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Been using the elite version for some time. As of lately, the app no longer gives you a notification when your rest time is up when I have the screen locked. I have the disable sleep mode set to on and was working before. I haven’t made any changes to my settings. This has been an issue since the last app update. Previously I would click on the Done button for a particular workout, and lock my phone and put it in my pocket while the rest timer would begin counting, once the timer was done it would give me the notification, it no longer does that. I have to keep my phone screen on in order for the timer to give me the notification. Used to be a great app until this issue began.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been using GymLife for almost 2 years and it’s really made my strength training workouts more efficient and enjoyable. Setting up new plans are a breeze, and the ability to have folders is amazing (especially if I switch up a plan every other month or so!). I also use my Apple Watch , and it’s great to have the option to follow your workout there— at the very least use it for HR monitoring. <br /><br />I highly recommend this app for anyone that is serious about seeing results and enjoys a friendly user interface that also packs a lot of data if you want to see it!</p>

I understand the developer needs to make money on their apps, but only allowing two workouts on their free version makes it essentially useless without the subscription. Even three workout, which was what I was planning on, would make it significantly better. I don't need yet another paid subscription.","title":"Only useful with subscription","userName":"aes06"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7847713003","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-09-26T15:28:59Z","rating":1,"review":"I’ve been searching for a decent app just to make a schedule that I can quickly pick up and look at while I’m in the gym to keep track of what I’ve got to do next instead of using my notes app. I just need 5 different schedules and this app only lets you make 2 before having to get an “elite” subscription.
