        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The latest update introducing separate “multi” and “single” connections testing was a dandy.  Just a great idea that provides very, very useful information in terms of gauging in-the-moment download/upload bandwidth capacity.  On top of that, the app continues to run as reliably and smoothly as ever.<br /><br />All that being said, however, I’ve found the “Notes” option for results less and less useful because of the inability to filter test results so that those with notes can be viewed separately.  Scrolling through dozens and dozens of test results to find those with tagged with note icons so that they can be analyzed and cross-referenced while tracking long term connectivity performance is far too cumbersome and time-consuming.  Call it nitpicking, but it voids the usefulness of the “Notes” feature as an analytical tool.  With a simple filter option, though, that issue vanishes.  If/when that happens, I’ll gladly bump my rating up to five stars and send due praise in an updated review.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have tried using this app many times and never get an accurate reading. I go on laptop and use another speed test that is much closer to reality. When it searches for nearby signals, it shows that it reads from areas near 100 miles away from my home while the web based finds signals only 5 miles from home. This app will tell me I only have 14 mbps while I actually pay for 200. When I use laptop it will show my almost 150 mbps out of possible 200. Then i compare to 2 other web based speed tests and they run very close to each other. Then try this app again and still between 14 to 20. Totally useless if they can’t get real readings. Am deleting after many many failed attempts. It just seems they want you to download the app for information collection on users rather than to supply services as stated in descriptions. Totally not cool and just reconfirms my reason not to trust apps very much. Apps are not here for you, they are more about collecting personal information for ads and informational sales to other parties. Ads are killing the positive internet experience. Not the reason I buy a computer, laptop or any other device.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have used this app and website to measure real time download and upload speeds both in professional settings and in my own home for about the last 4 years. But I have noticed something peculiar lately. I use the Nighthawk app for my home network management and they recently added a Speedtest feature. So the curious thing is that most of the time the Nighthawk app will show somewhere between 100 Mbps and 200 Mbps but every other device will show only about 10% of the download speed, sometimes including my phone running the app. Regardless of being on the manual 2.4/5ghz bands or in the router’s smart mode. The upload speed is usually consistent between all devices. And the speeds shown really don’t change as devices are taken off the network. This includes a smart tv, PCs and other peripheral devices, gaming consoles, phones and tablets. Any idea as to why the major difference between the two?</p>

We store page views, clicks and search terms used for ad personalization targeting separately from your Personal Information.\n\nWhat is the Lawful Basis for Processing Personal Information\n\nSUMMARY – LAWFUL BASIS FOR PROCESSING USER INFORMATION\n\nWe may Process your User Information where: you have given your consent; the Processing is necessary for a contract between you and us; the Processing is required by applicable law; the Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of any individual; or where we have a valid legitimate interest in the Processing.\n\nIn Processing your User Information in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy, we may rely on one or more of the following legal bases, depending on the circumstances:\n\nConsent: We may Process your User Information where we have obtained your prior, express consent to the Processing (this legal basis is only used in relation to Processing that is entirely voluntary – it is not used for Processing that is necessary or obligatory in any way);\nContractual necessity: We may Process your User Information where the Processing is necessary in connection with any contract that you may enter into with us;\nCompliance with applicable law: We may Process your User Information where the Processing is required by applicable law;\nVital interests: We may Process your User Information where the Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of any individual; or\nLegitimate interests: We may Process your User Information where we have a legitimate interest in carrying out the Processing for the purposes of managing, operating, improving or promoting our business, and that legitimate interest is not overridden by your interests, fundamental rights, or freedoms.\nAs described above, we have identified legitimate interest as the basis for processing in connection with the Speedtest and Sensorly offerings by Ookla and how we market our business to our current and prospective customers.\n\nFor Speedtest and Sensorly, Ookla has a legitimate interest in sharing your Speedtest results with internet providers, hardware manufacturers and industry regulators to help them understand and create a better and faster internet.\n\nWhat Information We Disclose to Third Parties\n\nSUMMARY – DISCLOSURE OF USER INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES\n\nWe may disclose your User Information to: legal and regulatory authorities; our external advisors; parties who Process User Information on our behalf (“Processors”); any party as necessary in connection with legal proceedings; any party as necessary for investigating, detecting or preventing criminal offences; any purchaser of our business; and any third party providers of advertising, plugins or content used on the Services.\n\nWe may disclose your User Information to other entities within the Company group, for legitimate business purposes (including operating the Services, and providing services to you), in accordance with applicable law. In addition, we may disclose your User Information to:\n\nlegal and regulatory authorities, upon request, or for the purposes of reporting any actual or suspected breach of applicable law or regulation;\noutside professional advisors (such as accountants, auditors, or lawyers), subject to binding contractual obligations of confidentiality;\nthird party Processors (such as analytic providers; data centers; etc.), located anywhere in the world, subject to the requirements noted below in this Section 9;\nany relevant party, law enforcement agency or court, to the extent necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal rights;\nany relevant party for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security;\nany relevant third party acquirer(s), in the event that we sell or transfer all or any relevant portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation);\nany relevant third party provider, where our Services use third party advertising, plugins or content. If you choose to interact with any such advertising, plugins or content, information about your activities on the Services and Channels to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests may be shared with the relevant third party provider. If you click or tap on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria;\nany sponsors of contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws, or white papers, webcasts or other downloads, the registration data for such events is to be used by us as part of User Information, and may be shared with the sponsor and others, subject to this Policy and the sponsor’s privacy policy. We may also share your information with third party vendors involved in the administration of such events. For contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws, please read the official rules or terms and conditions carefully before you submit your information; and\nto third parties whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., third party providers of goods and services, marketing and advertising companies and agencies, content publishers and retailers).\nFor some of our Services, we may make some information, such as the name of our users, their mailing address, phone number, email address—and in certain circumstances their employer’s name, company size and other industry data—available on a rental or other basis (e.g., sale) to third party providers of goods and services, for example, when such information is provided in connection with webcasts, white papers or other sponsored downloads.\n\nWhen you use a co-branded service (a service operated with a partner of Ookla), or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, you grant us permission to pass the collected information back to that partner, which may include third party service providers whose services are embedded into and/or appear within the Services;\n\nWith respect to surveys, in the event that responses are publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey. Otherwise we will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users’ responses in surveys to other participants in the survey. Where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where Ookla advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, Ookla reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no User Information identifying a specific user is disclosed.\n\nOokla and some of our advertisers may use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements, for OBA or otherwise, and perform related services when you interact with the Services. Often, these third party advertising companies employ cookies and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of website, app and email advertisements and to create a record of interaction with our content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites or applications, or for reporting website traffic, app use, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on the Services. We also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.\n\nWe may also sell or transfer Online Data to certain third parties such as advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests, and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of this information. Some of these third parties may combine the Online Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture.\n\nWe may engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of Online Data and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information. These third party providers may collect User Information from our Services for their own purposes, including but not limited to monitoring fraud around the web.\n\nWe may also engage third parties for the purpose of recognizing our users and delivering interest-based content and advertisements to them. We may share your User Information with our partners such as your name, postal address, email, or other identifier. Our partners may also: (i) collect information directly from your device, such as your IP address, device ID, advertising ID, and information about your browser or operating system; (ii) combine User Information about you received from Ookla with information about you from other sites or services; and (iii) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.\n\nExcept as otherwise described herein, the information we gather from all tests run through Ookla is collected anonymously and then aggregated to provide performance data to users on the Ookla websites, including its Speedtest server hosts, and/or to third parties to whom we license the information. We do this with the express intent of providing a neutral and unbiased monitoring and reporting resource for users around the world. The only Speedtest results we do not license to third parties are those test results from instances of Speedtest Custom which are made available pursuant to a paid subscription or white label Sensorly applications. In such instances, the Speedtest results are owned by the subscriber and are subject to that subscriber’s privacy policy.\n\nInformation collected through Speedtest and Sensorly may not be anonymous as follows: for some ISPs and mobile carriers, Ookla will provide full IP addresses and/or network, hardware or device identifiers for such ISP or mobile carrier’s customers upon request. Ookla may also provide full IP addresses and/or network, hardware and device identifiers, to equipment manufacturers and core network, or wholesale providers on a case-by-case basis for network research purposes. Ookla may also collect GeoIP Data and/or Precise Location Data, and such data may also be licensed and/or transferred to third parties.\n\nIf we engage a third-party Processor to Process your User Information, the Processor will be subject to binding contractual obligations to: (i) only Process the User Information in accordance with our prior written instructions; and (ii) use measures to protect the confidentiality and security of the User Information; together with any additional requirements under applicable law.\n\nThe Services contain links to other sites or partners whose information practices may be different from ours. You should consult the privacy policy of these third parties to learn how your privacy is protected.\n\nInternational Transfers of Information\n\nSUMMARY – INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF INFORMATION\n\nWe may transfer your Personal Information to recipients in other countries. Ookla participates in the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield and the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System. Where we transfer User Information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to a recipient outside the EEA that is not in an adequate jurisdiction, we do so on the basis of standard contractual clauses.\n\nBecause of the international nature of our business, we may need to transfer your User Information within the Ookla group of companies, and to third parties as noted in Section 9 above, in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy. For this reason, we may transfer your User Information to other countries that may have different laws and data protection compliance requirements to those that apply in the country in which you are located.\n\nOokla, LLC and its U.S. affiliates participate in and have certified their compliance with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Ookla is committed to subjecting all Personal Information received from European Union (E.U.) member countries and Switzerland, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. Ookla is responsible for the processing of Personal Information it receives under the Privacy Shield Framework and subsequent transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Ookla complies with the Privacy Shield principles for all onward transfers of Personal Information from the E.U. and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. With respect to Personal Information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Ookla is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Ookla may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. If you are a European individual with a privacy related complaint, concern or question about Ookla’ privacy practices, please contact us through our DSAR Portal. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, European individuals may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.\n\nWhere we transfer your Personal Information from the EEA to recipients located outside the EEA who are not in a jurisdiction that has been formally designated by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information, we do so on the basis of standard contractual clauses. You may request a copy of the relevant standard contractual clauses using our DSAR Portal.\n\nPlease note that when you transfer any Personal Information directly to a Company entity established outside the EEA, we are not responsible for that transfer of your Personal Information. We will nevertheless Process your Personal Information, from the point at which we receive the data, in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.\n\nOokla privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy comply with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (“APEC”) Cross Border Privacy Rules System. To learn more about this program, please click here.\n\nPlease note that we may use data collected by a third party operator/licensee of localized versions or editions of Services.\n\nData Security\n\nSUMMARY – DATA SECURITY\n\nWe implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your User Information. Please ensure that any Personal Information that you send to us is sent securely.\n\nWe have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your User Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized access, and other unlawful or unauthorized forms of Processing, in accordance with applicable law. In certain instances, we may use Secure Sockets Layer encryption and/or transfer certain User Information in a non-human readable format to provide protection. However, we cannot guarantee there will not be a breach, and we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of any third parties.\n\nBecause the internet is an open system, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will implement reasonable measures to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us using the internet. Any such transmission is at your own risk and you are responsible for ensuring that any Personal Information that you send to us are sent securely.\n\nData Accuracy\n\nSUMMARY – DATA ACCURACY\n\nWe take every reasonable step to ensure that your User Information is kept accurate and up-to-date and are erased or rectified if we become aware of inaccuracies.\n\nWe take every reasonable step to ensure that your User Information that we Process is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, and any of your User Information that we Process that you inform us is inaccurate (having regard to the purposes for which they are Processed) is erased or rectified.\n\nData Minimization\n\nSUMMARY – DATA MINIMIZATION\n\nWe take every reasonable step to limit the volume of your User Information that we Process to what is necessary.\n\nWe take every reasonable step to ensure that your User Information that we Process is limited to the User Information reasonably necessary in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy or as required to provide you services or access to the Services.\n\nData Retention\n\nSUMMARY – DATA RETENTION\n\nWe take every reasonable step to ensure that your User Information is only retained for as long as they are needed. Online Data related to OBA is kept by Ookla for not more than 180 days after which it will expire, subject to certain conditions.\n\nWe take every reasonable step to ensure that your User Information is only Processed for the minimum period necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy. The criteria for determining the duration for which we will keep your User Information are as follows: we will retain copies of your User Information in a form that permits identification only for as long as is necessary in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy, unless applicable law requires a longer retention period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we plan to retain it for no longer than is necessary to fulfill a legitimate business need. Ookla retains historical Speedtest and Sensorly data in connection with the following purposes identified in Section 5 above: conducting analyses and preparing product enhancements, preparing market reports, and licensing the Speedtest and Sensorly results and to its business customers. Ookla may also retain historical Speedtest and Sensorly data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.\n\nExcept as may be set forth in this Privacy Policy, Online Data related to OBA is retained by Ookla for not more than 180 days after which it shall expire. However, the 180 day period may commence again if the same user subsequently visits or interacts with an ad, email, the Services or a Channel.\n\nWhat Can I Do to Control My Information?\n\nSUMMARY – WHAT CAN I DO TO CONTROL MY INFORMATION?\n\nYou can directly take steps to change your preferences for newsletters and online behavioral advertising as outlined in this section.\n\nIf you are an EU resident, you may have certain rights including: the right not to provide your Personal Information to us; the right of access to your Personal Information; the right to request rectification of inaccuracies; the right to request the erasure, or restriction of Processing, of your Personal Information; the right to object to the Processing of your Personal Information; the right to have your Personal Information transferred to another controller; the right to withdraw consent; and the right to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities.

Just a great idea that provides very, very useful information in terms of gauging in-the-moment download/upload bandwidth capacity.  On top of that, the app continues to run as reliably and smoothly as ever.\n\nAll that being said, however, I’ve found the “Notes” option for results less and less useful because of the inability to filter test results so that those with notes can be viewed separately.  Scrolling through dozens and dozens of test results to find those with tagged with note icons so that they can be analyzed and cross-referenced while tracking long term connectivity performance is far too cumbersome and time-consuming.  Call it nitpicking, but it voids the usefulness of the “Notes” feature as an analytical tool.  With a simple filter option, though, that issue vanishes.  If/when that happens, I’ll gladly bump my rating up to five stars and send due praise in an updated review.","title":"New Tools Are Great, But ...","userName":"The Zohn"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7544792907","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-07-06T08:39:25Z","rating":1,"review":"I have tried using this app many times and never get an accurate reading.

This app will tell me I only have 14 mbps while I actually pay for 200. When I use laptop it will show my almost 150 mbps out of possible 200. Then i compare to 2 other web based speed tests and they run very close to each other. Then try this app again and still between 14 to 20. Totally useless if they can’t get real readings. Am deleting after many many failed attempts. It just seems they want you to download the app for information collection on users rather than to supply services as stated in descriptions.

So the curious thing is that most of the time the Nighthawk app will show somewhere between 100 Mbps and 200 Mbps but every other device will show only about 10% of the download speed, sometimes including my phone running the app. Regardless of being on the manual 2.4/5ghz bands or in the router’s smart mode.

This speed test really just does a speed test. One thing I’d love to see added is tests that’ll indicate throttling, speed drops because I notice a lot of internet companies will shoot max speed at the beginning for a speed test then drop a lot during downloads, and a test for frequency stability because that can cause problems with an internet company. I had problems with that with an internet company before with frequency instability causing bandwidth drops and disconnections. Once the internet company puts a stabilizer box between the router and cable, fixes the problem. If your Moro is to keep internet companies honest these sort of testers would be amazing.
