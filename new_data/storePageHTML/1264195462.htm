        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>A stellar app. It’s intuitive, easy to navigate, rewards consistent use, and fills a niche I’m not sure I knew existed. I love the ease of use and the instantaneous feedback from the community. My only critiques of the app as it is are:<br />• I wish rank was more transparent. I’d like to easily see what my rank is, how far I have to go to the next, and what ranks exist beyond my current one. I’d also like to know what, if anything, my ranking means beyond simply showing that I’ve made a lot of recommendations. <br />• I wish searches had less redundancy. There are often multiple editions of a book listed in a search, particularly with older works. Having singular instances of books would be a quality of life improvement. <br />More than anything, I’m hoping to see new features added. Movies+TV, books, and podcasts make up a good chunk of media consumption, but I’d love to see sections for games and music, as well. I’d also love to see the restaurants section get on par with the media sections: it’s the weakest part of the app right now, and I can’t wait to see it made as good as the other parts.</p>

    Hit or Miss

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Some of the features on this app are pretty good. I especially like the option to ask specific questions and get recommendations from other users. But when it comes to the “today” page, it’s a complete hit or miss. Some days they’ll only show me 3 or 4 movies, and none of them will be even close to things I like (which is super frustrating because you have to wait a full 24 hours for new ones.) But other days I’ll get 6 or 7 that are great. It’s also annoying that they ask me to choose from podcasts every day, even though I clearly don’t like podcasts, as I haven’t saved a single one. Yet they will show me literally zero books, even though I have multiple lists full of novels. Basically, the user recommendation feature is great, but the algorithm is mediocre at best.<br /><br />Beyond that, this app also just has a bunch of little problems that altogether make it annoying to use. The biggest one is that if your post exceeds a certain character limit, it just shows a “...” but there’s no way to view the full thing. You also can’t comment on a move or book unless you’ve liked it, and it sometimes crashes. It’s also pretty stupid that they mark it as 12+ but if you aren’t at least 13 you can’t even make an account, this didn’t effect me but it did effect my brother and that’s just dumb. Among other smaller problems. Just needs some updating for sure.<br /><br />EDIT: Absolutely hate the new update. Layout is so annoying and confusing. Probably will stop using the app now</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Honestly, I’m a movie buff and love re-watching the same movies with new perspectives. Sometimes it&#39;s hard to remember all of my favorite movies or tv shows. I use this app to save shows that I&#39;ve watched, want to watch, or rewatch.  I love the grouping of recommendations based on your saves, for example, “my favorite comedy shows and movies.” I tend to do this on my own time, but I think it could go further, like when I&#39;m in the mood for empowering movies with a strong female lead in business. It could, for example, recommend The Devil Wears Prada and The Intern, two of my favorites.  Or if I want to watch movies based in Paris, it could group recommend Pixar&#39;s Ratatouille with another Paris-based movie. Or even groupings based on classic chick flicks. I understand this would take a lot more time, and you would probably would to have someone physically creating collections, as opposed to Ai like I think it is now. But hey, if you&#39;re interested in I’m all on board. Overall I love this app. It’s free, and if you watch movies or tv shows, I don’t see any reason not to use it!</p>

Policy:\n\nEffective Date 8/10/2017\n\nYour privacy is important to us and we are committed to protecting your information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.\n\nOverview\nThis Privacy Policy describes the collection, use and disclosure of information by Likewise, Inc. (”Likewise”, ”we”, ”us”) and other parties with respect to your use of all properties (Web sites, mobile applications, or otherwise) owned or operated by Likewise and our affiliates (collectively, the “Properties”), and all products and services available from Likewise and our affiliates, or other third parties in connection with the Properties (individually and collectively with the Properties, the “Services”). By accessing or using the Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Services. All capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in our Terms of Use (Terms and Privacy Policy can be found within the mobile application and at www.likewise.com). References to “you” mean you as a User. References to Likewise (or ”we” or ”us”) also include Likewise’s service providers and partners, to the extent that such service providers are collecting, using or disclosing information for or on behalf of Likewise.\n\nPrivacy Policy Updates\nWe may update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a revised version. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective immediately upon posting. Please review this Privacy Policy each time you use the Services, as your continued use of the Services after such changes will constitute your acceptance and agreement to such changes.\n\nCollection of Information\nInformation You Provide\nInformation You Submit. You will need to open an account if you would like to use the Services. When using the Services, you may elect to provide information about yourself, such as name, email address, friends and information about your use of the Services or your experiences with Likewise or Users. You may provide this information, for example, when you create an account, post User Submissions, request or purchase products or services, communicate with us or a User, subscribe to our email programs, ”Like” us on Facebook or otherwise connect us to your social networks, or complete other forms. In connection with the Services, you may also elect to provide lists, reviews, comments, feedback, notes, photos, videos, know-how, techniques, or other information relating to you.\n\nThird Party Authentication. If you use a third party connection function offered through the Services to create an account and login, then you agree that we may access any of your profile information that you have made available to be shared including your profile photo, your email address and your lists and to use it in accordance with the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. Please refer to the third party connection policies to manage information that is shared through that account.\n\nInformation We Collect Automatically\nCookies and Web Beacons. We, our service providers and our advertising networks use cookies, web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs or action tags) or similar technologies in connection with the Services, in emails and in advertisements to collect information about your online activities. Cookies (small data files that your Internet browser stores on your hard disk or in your browser’s memory) are used by the Services to connect your activity on the Services with other information we store about you in your account profile or from prior usage of the Services. Web beacons are electronic images that assist in delivering cookies, provide additional information (such as which ad you clicked on to arrive at the Services) and allow us to compile aggregated statistics. For example, the use of cookies allows us to improve our Services by tracking saved searches, understanding your and other site visitors’ use of various features and functionality, delivering targeted ads that are more relevant to you, avoiding ad duplication, measuring the effectiveness of advertising and otherwise creating a consistent user experience for you. Collected information may include the content you view, the date and time you view content, and the referring web site or advertisement. This information may be associated with your unique browser, device identifier or IP address.\nAt any time, you may adjust your browser settings to delete existing cookies (and the data that web beacons add to the cookie), or refuse new cookies, according to the method permitted by your browser. If you choose to delete cookies, you will need to log in again on your next visit to the Services and re-enter any preferences you have set. If you choose to disable cookies, you may not be able to access or use some portions and features of the Services and may not get the best experience possible.\nYour browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and other properties that you do not wish such operators to track certain online activities. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time.\nLog Usage Data. Our servers automatically record usage log data created when you use the Services. Usage log data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring web page, referring email, referring application, visited web pages, location, mobile carrier, computer or mobile device type, search terms, content viewed, content created, and cookie information.\nLocation Data. If you provide location information during the account registration process or at any other time via your account settings, or if location information is included as part of the information we collect (for example, your IP address may provide an approximate geo-location), we may store that information in connection with your account. If you are using mobile Services, we may collect location data directly from your mobile device if your device allows us to do so. Your mobile device manufacturer or mobile service provider may provide you with choices about how and whether location data is shared with us.\n\nOther Information We Collect\nEmail and Mobile Content Programs. You can choose to receive promotional emails from us. Like most e-commerce sites, we include software code in our emails to monitor whether and when you opened the email, whether you have clicked on the images and/or links in the email, and whether your computer or mobile device is capable of receiving HTML-based email. You may also choose to access our content through a mobile application and to receive text messages on your mobile device.\n\nInformation Collected by Third Parties\nOnline Activity. You may get cookies or web beacons from our advertisers, tracking utilities, partners or other third parties with links on the Properties. While this is a standard practice in the industry, we have no control or access to these cookies or web beacons. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the use of these technologies by third parties or the use of such technologies on websites or mobile applications other than the Properties.\n\nAggregate Information\nWe collect non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Services, such as how many visitors visit a specific page, how long they stay, and which links they click on. We may also group and de-personalize information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe and analyze Services usage. Information collected may be combined with other personal or aggregate information, including information we collect by other means (for example, if you call or email us). The combined information will also be subject to this Privacy Policy.\n\nUse of Information\nAny information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n• To provide the Services;\n• To improve the Services (for example, to personalize your experience to make it smoother and more relevant to you, and to improve the content and design of the Properties;\n• To process transactions, to provide and improve customer service, and to otherwise manage our customer relationships;\n• To provide you with information about products and services from Likewise and our partners that may be of interest to you, and to optimize our and our partners’ marketing campaigns;\n• To provide you with complementary product and services that may be of interest to you, including discounts and other benefits from our partners;\n• To administer contests, promotions or sweepstakes;\n• To prevent fraud and abuse, to comply with applicable laws and legal process, to address technical and security issues, to comply with applicable laws and legal process, and to otherwise protect Users and our business;\n• To develop and deliver our advertising, products and services and analyze their effectiveness; and\n• To perform other functions described at the time the information is collected.\n\nDisclosure of Information\nInformation that you choose to provide in a public area of the Services (such as your profile page, lists or via User Submissions) will not be protected by this Privacy Policy because you have chosen to make that information public. Otherwise, your information and aggregate information will be shared with third parties only in accordance with this Privacy Policy, as follows:\nConsent\nWe may share your information when you consent or direct Likewise to do so. The method of consent will be appropriate for the type of personal information involved and the purposes for which it is collected, used or disclosed. Depending on the circumstances, consent may be express (i.e., you specifically agree either verbally, in writing or electronically) or implied.\nCompliance with Laws and Policies; Protection of Rights\nWe may release your information (including personally identifiable information) and aggregated information when we believe that doing so is appropriate to comply with applicable laws, regulations, subpoenas, warrants or court orders, or other legal requirements; to cooperate with government or law enforcement; to resolve complaints or disputes; to avoid legal liability; to comply with, enforce or investigate potential violations of our agreements, Terms of Use, Privacy Policy or other policies; to bill and collect amounts owed to us; to protect our rights, reputation, safety or property or that of Users or others; and to address fraud, security or technical issues.\nSale/Merger\nWe can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.\nContest/Sweepstakes\nWe may publicly disclose the name, city and state of winners.\nAggregate Data\nWe may share aggregated, non-personal data with service providers, advertisers or existing or potential business partners.\nOpting Out; Editing Your Personal Information\nChanging Information\nWe provide choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls.\nEmail Programs\nYou may unsubscribe at any time from our email programs by clicking on the unsubscribe link included at the bottom of every email message or by sending a request to legal@likewise.com. We reserve the right to send you service announcements (such as notifications about site outages) or administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.\nMobile Programs\nYou may opt out of a specific mobile messaging campaign by texting ”stop”. Text “stop all” to opt out of all mobile messaging.\n\nYour California Privacy Rights\nSection 1798.83 of the California Civil Code permits California residents to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information about our disclosure of personal information during the prior calendar year to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. You may make one request each year by emailing us at legal@likewise.com or writing us at 10400 NE 4th Street, Suite 500, Bellevue WA 98005.\n\nSecurity\nThe security of your personal information is important to us. We maintain industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards, such as firewalls and encryption technology, to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. However, no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the protection of any information shared with us.\nIf you create an account, you may be asked to choose a password to protect your account and account information. We recommend that you do not disclose your password to any other person. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.\n\nGeneral\nChildren\nThe Services are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect or store any personally identifiable information about persons under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personally identifiable information of a child under 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our files. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through the Properties.\nThird-Party Websites\nOur Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on another website or service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the website or service and is subject to that party’s privacy policy. In addition, if you visit the Services through a link or advertisement on another website, then that website may be collecting information from users who click on the link or banner, and the collected information will be subject to that website’s privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any such websites or services, and we are not responsible for their content, privacy or security practices and policies. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.\nGoverning Law; Visitors Residing Outside the United States\nAll of the Services are hosted in the United States. This Privacy Policy and the privacy practices of our Services will be subject exclusively to the laws of the State of Washington within the United States of America, without regard to conflict of law principles. If you reside outside of the United States, you are responsible for complying with local laws in connection with your use of the Services, and you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, and use of your personal information in the United States of America in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n\nLikewise Terms of Use\nYour access or use of the Services is subject to Likewise’s Terms of Use (Terms and Privacy Policy can be found within the mobile application and at www.likewise.com).\n\nContacting Us \nIf you have any questions or suggestions regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us by email at legal@likewise.com or in writing at 10400 NE 4th Street, 5th Floor, Bellevue WA 98004.","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Picks from your trusted friends"},"is32bitOnly":false,"isStandaloneWithCompanionForWatchOS":false,"seller":"Likewise, Inc.","isSiriSupported":false,"languageList":["English"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"description":{"standard":"Your new personal streaming guide.

(”Likewise”, ”we”, ”us”) and other parties with respect to your use of all properties (Web sites, mobile applications, or otherwise) owned or operated by Likewise and our affiliates (collectively, the “Properties”), and all products and services available from Likewise and our affiliates, or other third parties in connection with the Properties (individually and collectively with the Properties, the “Services”). By accessing or using the Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Services. All capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in our Terms of Use (Terms and Privacy Policy can be found within the mobile application and at www.likewise.com). References to “you” mean you as a User. References to Likewise (or ”we” or ”us”) also include Likewise’s service providers and partners, to the extent that such service providers are collecting, using or disclosing information for or on behalf of Likewise.\n\nPrivacy Policy Updates\nWe may update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a revised version. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective immediately upon posting. Please review this Privacy Policy each time you use the Services, as your continued use of the Services after such changes will constitute your acceptance and agreement to such changes.\n\nCollection of Information\nInformation You Provide\nInformation You Submit. You will need to open an account if you would like to use the Services. When using the Services, you may elect to provide information about yourself, such as name, email address, friends and information about your use of the Services or your experiences with Likewise or Users. You may provide this information, for example, when you create an account, post User Submissions, request or purchase products or services, communicate with us or a User, subscribe to our email programs, ”Like” us on Facebook or otherwise connect us to your social networks, or complete other forms. In connection with the Services, you may also elect to provide lists, reviews, comments, feedback, notes, photos, videos, know-how, techniques, or other information relating to you.\n\nThird Party Authentication. If you use a third party connection function offered through the Services to create an account and login, then you agree that we may access any of your profile information that you have made available to be shared including your profile photo, your email address and your lists and to use it in accordance with the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. Please refer to the third party connection policies to manage information that is shared through that account.\n\nInformation We Collect Automatically\nCookies and Web Beacons. We, our service providers and our advertising networks use cookies, web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs or action tags) or similar technologies in connection with the Services, in emails and in advertisements to collect information about your online activities. Cookies (small data files that your Internet browser stores on your hard disk or in your browser’s memory) are used by the Services to connect your activity on the Services with other information we store about you in your account profile or from prior usage of the Services. Web beacons are electronic images that assist in delivering cookies, provide additional information (such as which ad you clicked on to arrive at the Services) and allow us to compile aggregated statistics. For example, the use of cookies allows us to improve our Services by tracking saved searches, understanding your and other site visitors’ use of various features and functionality, delivering targeted ads that are more relevant to you, avoiding ad duplication, measuring the effectiveness of advertising and otherwise creating a consistent user experience for you. Collected information may include the content you view, the date and time you view content, and the referring web site or advertisement. This information may be associated with your unique browser, device identifier or IP address.\nAt any time, you may adjust your browser settings to delete existing cookies (and the data that web beacons add to the cookie), or refuse new cookies, according to the method permitted by your browser. If you choose to delete cookies, you will need to log in again on your next visit to the Services and re-enter any preferences you have set. If you choose to disable cookies, you may not be able to access or use some portions and features of the Services and may not get the best experience possible.\nYour browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and other properties that you do not wish such operators to track certain online activities. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time.\nLog Usage Data. Our servers automatically record usage log data created when you use the Services. Usage log data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring web page, referring email, referring application, visited web pages, location, mobile carrier, computer or mobile device type, search terms, content viewed, content created, and cookie information.\nLocation Data. If you provide location information during the account registration process or at any other time via your account settings, or if location information is included as part of the information we collect (for example, your IP address may provide an approximate geo-location), we may store that information in connection with your account. If you are using mobile Services, we may collect location data directly from your mobile device if your device allows us to do so. Your mobile device manufacturer or mobile service provider may provide you with choices about how and whether location data is shared with us.\n\nOther Information We Collect\nEmail and Mobile Content Programs. You can choose to receive promotional emails from us. Like most e-commerce sites, we include software code in our emails to monitor whether and when you opened the email, whether you have clicked on the images and/or links in the email, and whether your computer or mobile device is capable of receiving HTML-based email. You may also choose to access our content through a mobile application and to receive text messages on your mobile device.\n\nInformation Collected by Third Parties\nOnline Activity. You may get cookies or web beacons from our advertisers, tracking utilities, partners or other third parties with links on the Properties. While this is a standard practice in the industry, we have no control or access to these cookies or web beacons. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the use of these technologies by third parties or the use of such technologies on websites or mobile applications other than the Properties.\n\nAggregate Information\nWe collect non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Services, such as how many visitors visit a specific page, how long they stay, and which links they click on. We may also group and de-personalize information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe and analyze Services usage. Information collected may be combined with other personal or aggregate information, including information we collect by other means (for example, if you call or email us). The combined information will also be subject to this Privacy Policy.\n\nUse of Information\nAny information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n• To provide the Services;\n• To improve the Services (for example, to personalize your experience to make it smoother and more relevant to you, and to improve the content and design of the Properties;\n• To process transactions, to provide and improve customer service, and to otherwise manage our customer relationships;\n• To provide you with information about products and services from Likewise and our partners that may be of interest to you, and to optimize our and our partners’ marketing campaigns;\n• To provide you with complementary product and services that may be of interest to you, including discounts and other benefits from our partners;\n• To administer contests, promotions or sweepstakes;\n• To prevent fraud and abuse, to comply with applicable laws and legal process, to address technical and security issues, to comply with applicable laws and legal process, and to otherwise protect Users and our business;\n• To develop and deliver our advertising, products and services and analyze their effectiveness; and\n• To perform other functions described at the time the information is collected.\n\nDisclosure of Information\nInformation that you choose to provide in a public area of the Services (such as your profile page, lists or via User Submissions) will not be protected by this Privacy Policy because you have chosen to make that information public. Otherwise, your information and aggregate information will be shared with third parties only in accordance with this Privacy Policy, as follows:\nConsent\nWe may share your information when you consent or direct Likewise to do so. The method of consent will be appropriate for the type of personal information involved and the purposes for which it is collected, used or disclosed. Depending on the circumstances, consent may be express (i.e., you specifically agree either verbally, in writing or electronically) or implied.\nCompliance with Laws and Policies; Protection of Rights\nWe may release your information (including personally identifiable information) and aggregated information when we believe that doing so is appropriate to comply with applicable laws, regulations, subpoenas, warrants or court orders, or other legal requirements; to cooperate with government or law enforcement; to resolve complaints or disputes; to avoid legal liability; to comply with, enforce or investigate potential violations of our agreements, Terms of Use, Privacy Policy or other policies; to bill and collect amounts owed to us; to protect our rights, reputation, safety or property or that of Users or others; and to address fraud, security or technical issues.\nSale/Merger\nWe can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.\nContest/Sweepstakes\nWe may publicly disclose the name, city and state of winners.\nAggregate Data\nWe may share aggregated, non-personal data with service providers, advertisers or existing or potential business partners.\nOpting Out; Editing Your Personal Information\nChanging Information\nWe provide choices about the collection, use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls.\nEmail Programs\nYou may unsubscribe at any time from our email programs by clicking on the unsubscribe link included at the bottom of every email message or by sending a request to legal@likewise.com. We reserve the right to send you service announcements (such as notifications about site outages) or administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.\nMobile Programs\nYou may opt out of a specific mobile messaging campaign by texting ”stop”. Text “stop all” to opt out of all mobile messaging.\n\nYour California Privacy Rights\nSection 1798.83 of the California Civil Code permits California residents to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information about our disclosure of personal information during the prior calendar year to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. You may make one request each year by emailing us at legal@likewise.com or writing us at 10400 NE 4th Street, Suite 500, Bellevue WA 98005.\n\nSecurity\nThe security of your personal information is important to us. We maintain industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards, such as firewalls and encryption technology, to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. However, no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the protection of any information shared with us.\nIf you create an account, you may be asked to choose a password to protect your account and account information. We recommend that you do not disclose your password to any other person. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.\n\nGeneral\nChildren\nThe Services are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect or store any personally identifiable information about persons under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personally identifiable information of a child under 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our files. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through the Properties.\nThird-Party Websites\nOur Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on another website or service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the website or service and is subject to that party’s privacy policy. In addition, if you visit the Services through a link or advertisement on another website, then that website may be collecting information from users who click on the link or banner, and the collected information will be subject to that website’s privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any such websites or services, and we are not responsible for their content, privacy or security practices and policies. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.\nGoverning Law; Visitors Residing Outside the United States\nAll of the Services are hosted in the United States. This Privacy Policy and the privacy practices of our Services will be subject exclusively to the laws of the State of Washington within the United States of America, without regard to conflict of law principles. If you reside outside of the United States, you are responsible for complying with local laws in connection with your use of the Services, and you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, and use of your personal information in the United States of America in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n\nLikewise Terms of Use\nYour access or use of the Services is subject to Likewise’s Terms of Use (Terms and Privacy Policy can be found within the mobile application and at www.likewise.com).\n\nContacting Us \nIf you have any questions or suggestions regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us by email at legal@likewise.com or in writing at 10400 NE 4th Street, 5th Floor, Bellevue WA 98004.","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Picks from your trusted friends"},"is32bitOnly":false,"isStandaloneWithCompanionForWatchOS":false,"seller":"Likewise, Inc.","isSiriSupported":false,"languageList":["English"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"description":{"standard":"Find your next favorite with Likewise.

I love the ease of use and the instantaneous feedback from the community. My only critiques of the app as it is are:\n• I wish rank was more transparent. I’d like to easily see what my rank is, how far I have to go to the next, and what ranks exist beyond my current one. I’d also like to know what, if anything, my ranking means beyond simply showing that I’ve made a lot of recommendations. \n• I wish searches had less redundancy. There are often multiple editions of a book listed in a search, particularly with older works. Having singular instances of books would be a quality of life improvement. \nMore than anything, I’m hoping to see new features added. Movies+TV, books, and podcasts make up a good chunk of media consumption, but I’d love to see sections for games and music, as well. I’d also love to see the restaurants section get on par with the media sections: it’s the weakest part of the app right now, and I can’t wait to see it made as good as the other parts.","title":"Easy, intuitive, and truly useful","userName":"BearRespecter"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7253261432","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-04-23T03:45:23Z","developerResponse":{"id":22469539,"body":"Hi Raven!

I especially like the option to ask specific questions and get recommendations from other users. But when it comes to the “today” page, it’s a complete hit or miss. Some days they’ll only show me 3 or 4 movies, and none of them will be even close to things I like (which is super frustrating because you have to wait a full 24 hours for new ones.) But other days I’ll get 6 or 7 that are great. It’s also annoying that they ask me to choose from podcasts every day, even though I clearly don’t like podcasts, as I haven’t saved a single one. Yet they will show me literally zero books, even though I have multiple lists full of novels. Basically, the user recommendation feature is great, but the algorithm is mediocre at best.\n\nBeyond that, this app also just has a bunch of little problems that altogether make it annoying to use. The biggest one is that if your post exceeds a certain character limit, it just shows a “...” but there’s no way to view the full thing. You also can’t comment on a move or book unless you’ve liked it, and it sometimes crashes. It’s also pretty stupid that they mark it as 12+ but if you aren’t at least 13 you can’t even make an account, this didn’t effect me but it did effect my brother and that’s just dumb. Among other smaller problems. Just needs some updating for sure.\n\nEDIT: Absolutely hate the new update. Layout is so annoying and confusing.

Sometimes it's hard to remember all of my favorite movies or tv shows. I use this app to save shows that I've watched, want to watch, or rewatch.  I love the grouping of recommendations based on your saves, for example, “my favorite comedy shows and movies.” I tend to do this on my own time, but I think it could go further, like when I'm in the mood for empowering movies with a strong female lead in business. It could, for example, recommend The Devil Wears Prada and The Intern, two of my favorites.  Or if I want to watch movies based in Paris, it could group recommend Pixar's Ratatouille with another Paris-based movie. Or even groupings based on classic chick flicks. I understand this would take a lot more time, and you would probably would to have someone physically creating collections, as opposed to Ai like I think it is now.

I selected several books on accident that I didn’t mean to select when going through the initial “things I have read and liked” that I haven’t actually read, but there is no way to unselect that you have read them or delete them out of your list of read books later on.

I also love spreading the word of my favorite shows and books. But after a while, you begin to realize that you’re recommending the same things over and over again. Pretty much everyone on the app asks the same question over and over again, leading to a very repetitive experience. If you’re looking for recommendations, don’t even ask a question because you can scroll through the most recent asks and get all the same answers that you would have gotten on your own unless you asked for something super specific. I wish you got more daily recommendation type stuff since you can blow through those in a minute or two. Also, the notification system is awful. It needs to be completely redone in a more efficient way. It would also be great if there was a video game section. That seems like a natural inclusion for this sort of app. It was fun for a little bit, but there needs to be more substance to keep you interested long term.","title":"Fun for a while","userName":"tate8525"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7353736740","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-05-18T03:38:55Z","developerResponse":{"id":22856868,"body":"Hi Sally!

But with LikeWise you have all these other people who love tv/movies/books as much as you. So the suggestions are diverse yet spot-on.

Next day original comment stood starting the convo, but all subsequent comments (including my own) were deleted and replaced with new ones from other users). Either the app can’t save or the developer is hugely over-moderating user comments. Whatever the explanation, I now see why there are so few comments on the app. \n\nHalf the point for me is to know what others think about books, films, etc. Getting rid of those conversations on developer whims makes the app pretty meaningless to me.

I did this for the TV Shows category, but after that, I was never able to navigate back to the other categories again. I could have tried harder to locate that part of the app, but I shouldn’t have to try hard. Second, there were useless and irritating features like a pop-up window that came out if nowhere and said something like “Great job making recommendations! Keep up the good work!” (something I hadn’t actually done). I had to make it go away by clicking a button that said “Awesome!” Finally, and most disappointingly, the algorithm for making recommendations wasn’t that effective. It spit out the name of a fairly pedestrian American police procedural based on the fact that I liked the stylistically very different “Sherlock” and “Killing Eve.” Then it recommended a random new David Spade show based on...nothing, apparently.
