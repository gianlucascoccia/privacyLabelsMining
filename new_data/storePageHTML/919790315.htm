    Great concept but apps need more fine tuning

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love shudder and what it offers for people like myself who are into the horror genre, and the price for a year is unbeatable. So as a concept for streaming options it is a solid 5 stars.<br /><br />However, the app itself is problematic for several reasons. The search options are not as widespread as major streaming services like Netflix offer. The app has a tendency to shut off suddenly or crash that I do not notice with other streaming apps. It will not save your spot in a show or movie unless you manually exit out of the video to the main screen first, which is not true of netflix. The phone app also doesn’t sync with bluetooth headphones well so I cannot pause and play like I can with anything else in my phone. The phone app does do a good job of showing you the ratings of the movie and details with suggested titles but the xbox app lacks this ability and is limited in presentation overall. <br /><br />So great streaming service but the apps have a long way to go. I paid for a year so it is clearly worth the glitches. Looking forward to some improvements...</p>

    Why?

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>There are a few good movies but nothing major. This app is a list of old and foreign films with a few Redbox movies thrown in for fun. When you write a review and it’s not stellar, the review doesn’t show up on the reviews. There are a few gems, yet they are b flicks and very few and far between. Most of the time you watch a movie just to be disappointed. The service works well. Unless  you can speak 10 languages or want to read for an hour skip it. I paid for a year so I guess I’m in it. I may cancel soon and they can keep the money. Who knows? Better to just rent a few from companies that don’t cut review or skimp on movies. I looked forward to this app. Now I’m just kicking myself for this decision. I’m writing this because I can’t find a single movie to watch after having shutter for a month. One full month and now I have an app that is as useful as a trampoline in outer space. The scary part of shutter is that I signed up for a year. That’s the first scary thing I have experienced with this app. No name movies most of which have been around longer than my 17 year old daughter. Why can this company not listen to horror fans? This app was made for hipsters and loners who don’t know quality. This is sad because the idea is epic but the execution was lack luster to say the least. There are very few movies on the app and very few worth while titles.</p>

    Almost great

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>A lot of great titles to choose from, and it’s especially nice how many older and foreign titles there are. Shudder definitely knows their stuff. Major bonus points for the Joe Bib Briggs marathon. Whoever’s decision that was needs a raise!<br /><br />My middling rating is only because I think Shudder still has room to grow, especially the design and layout of the platform. Limiting the ability to search only by title rather than other keywords like actor or director, especially with genre films like horror and thriller, is pretty annoying. It would be really nice and convenient to be able to isolate Shudder’s selection of Argento or Cronenberg films, for instance, or see which films feature Brigitte Lahaie. Also when searching through genres, it seems like the movies are always in reverse chronological order, which makes sense, but is also kind of frustrating while trying to brush up on the classics. Lastly, and I realize this is probably a licensing issue, but it’s kind of weird that there are various entries from certain series while omitting crucial chunks from those series (Phantasm without part 2, Halloween without parts 2 &amp; 3). <br /><br />Overall, been having a lot of fun with this app, but would look forward to some adjustments.</p>

You can find our address and other contact information in Section 15 below.\n\n\n1. WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY? “Shudder Services,” means the services provided and made available by Shudder LLC and its affiliates (collectively, \"Shudder\", \"we\", \"our\" or \"us\") in connection with your browsing and viewing of Shudder multimedia (such as movies and television shows) (“Content”) through Shudder websites, applications, or other interfaces and platforms. The Shudder Services also include any other technologies, features, and content we may provide or use on the Shudder user interfaces. This Policy is incorporated into the Shudder Terms of Use. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy or the Terms of Use, please do not use the Shudder Services. This Policy does not apply to information that is collected outside of the Shudder Services., \n\n\n2. WILL THIS POLICY EVER CHANGE? We may change this Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by posting the updated policy and revising the “Effective Date” above. Use of the Shudder Services after the posted Effective Date means you accept the current version of the Policy, including any changes made prior to the posted Effective Date. If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will also notify you by email or by means of a notice on the Shudder Services. We encourage you to review the Policy whenever you use our Shudder Services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.\n\n\n3. WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED FROM ME? Information you provide to us: We collect information that you submit to us. For example, the process of creating or editing your user profile may require you to provide us with a name, e-mail address, phone number, physical address (including postal code), password of your choice and cable provider. When you personalize your profile and use the features of the Shudder Services, we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of the Shudder Services, such as a profile picture and birthday. Additionally, we collect any information that you voluntarily enter into any postings, comments or forums within the Shudder Services, including private messages you send to other users of the Shudder Services. And, if you e-mail us, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files and other information you choose to provide to us. Information We Collect Automatically From Your Devices: When you use Shudder Services, we may collect information about the device you use to access the Shudder Services, including hardware model, operating system and version, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and other unique device identifiers, mobile network information and information about the device’s interaction with our Shudder Services. We also collect information about how you use Shudder Services, including your access times, browser types, and language preferences. This type of data enables us to understand how often individuals use parts of the Shudder Services so we can analyze and improve them. To collect this information, we use cookies and other tracking technologies. To learn more about how we automatically receive and record information when you interact with the Shudder Services, please review our Cookies Policy. This policy covers only our use of cookies or tracking technologies; it does not cover the use of cookies or other technologies by third parties. However, options you have to control the use of third party cookies are explained in our Cookies Policy. Location Information: We may collect different types of information about your location, including general information, such as the city, state and/or postal code associated with your IP Address, and, if you agree, more specific location information that is provided through the GPS functionality on mobile devices used to access the Shudder Services. We may use such location information to customize the Shudder Services, including advertising that is presented to you. For example, if you provide a postal code that indicates that you live in a particular city, the Shudder Services may be customized with information, features, or advertisements specific to that city. In order to do this, your location information may be passed along to our affiliates, agents, vendors or advertisers. Options you have to control the automatic collection of location information are explained below under “What Are My Choices.” Information from Social Media Networks and Other Third Parties: We may obtain information about you or your use of the Shudder Services from third parties and sources, such as our vendors, like web host providers, analytics providers or advertisers. We may combine the information you provide us and information we automatically collected with information from public or third-party sources. You may give us permission to access your information, including personally identifiable information from services offered by third parties, including social media networks. For example, to access the Shudder Services, you may choose to login via Facebook or link your Facebook account to the Shudder Services, which allows us to obtain information from your Facebook account, such as your friends or contacts, profile picture, birthdate, gender, or other profile-related information and any other information you have opted to share with “everyone” on Facebook (or similar third party platform). The information we obtain from such third party services depends on your account/privacy settings with those third parties and the third parties’ privacy policies, so be sure to check those policies and to adjust your settings to meet your preferences. When you access the Shudder Services through social media networks and other third party platforms, you are authorizing us to collect, store and use the information we obtain from third party services in accordance with this Policy. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that we collect through the Shudder Services, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Policy. Please keep in mind that any information provided to us by a third party may also be subject to that third party’s privacy policy. Payment Information: If you purchase a product or service through the Shudder Services, our third party payment processors will collect the billing and financial information they need to process your charges. This may include your postal address, email address and financial information. We do not directly collect or store your financial information, like credit card numbers. However, our third party payment processors may share non-financial information with us related to your purchases, like your name, shipping address and items purchased in order to fulfill your order.

So as a concept for streaming options it is a solid 5 stars.\n\nHowever, the app itself is problematic for several reasons. The search options are not as widespread as major streaming services like Netflix offer. The app has a tendency to shut off suddenly or crash that I do not notice with other streaming apps. It will not save your spot in a show or movie unless you manually exit out of the video to the main screen first, which is not true of netflix. The phone app also doesn’t sync with bluetooth headphones well so I cannot pause and play like I can with anything else in my phone. The phone app does do a good job of showing you the ratings of the movie and details with suggested titles but the xbox app lacks this ability and is limited in presentation overall. \n\nSo great streaming service but the apps have a long way to go.

This app is a list of old and foreign films with a few Redbox movies thrown in for fun. When you write a review and it’s not stellar, the review doesn’t show up on the reviews. There are a few gems, yet they are b flicks and very few and far between. Most of the time you watch a movie just to be disappointed. The service works well. Unless  you can speak 10 languages or want to read for an hour skip it. I paid for a year so I guess I’m in it. I may cancel soon and they can keep the money. Who knows? Better to just rent a few from companies that don’t cut review or skimp on movies. I looked forward to this app. Now I’m just kicking myself for this decision. I’m writing this because I can’t find a single movie to watch after having shutter for a month. One full month and now I have an app that is as useful as a trampoline in outer space. The scary part of shutter is that I signed up for a year. That’s the first scary thing I have experienced with this app. No name movies most of which have been around longer than my 17 year old daughter. Why can this company not listen to horror fans? This app was made for hipsters and loners who don’t know quality. This is sad because the idea is epic but the execution was lack luster to say the least.

Shudder definitely knows their stuff. Major bonus points for the Joe Bib Briggs marathon. Whoever’s decision that was needs a raise!\n\nMy middling rating is only because I think Shudder still has room to grow, especially the design and layout of the platform. Limiting the ability to search only by title rather than other keywords like actor or director, especially with genre films like horror and thriller, is pretty annoying. It would be really nice and convenient to be able to isolate Shudder’s selection of Argento or Cronenberg films, for instance, or see which films feature Brigitte Lahaie. Also when searching through genres, it seems like the movies are always in reverse chronological order, which makes sense, but is also kind of frustrating while trying to brush up on the classics. Lastly, and I realize this is probably a licensing issue, but it’s kind of weird that there are various entries from certain series while omitting crucial chunks from those series (Phantasm without part 2, Halloween without parts 2 \u0026 3). \n\nOverall, been having a lot of fun with this app, but would look forward to some adjustments.","title":"Almost great","userName":"gimme_soper"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7135723520","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-03-23T15:17:33Z","rating":1,"review":"I have been a long time on and off Shudder subscriber, cancelling once getting thru everything new and restarting when I saw new things. One day I decided to cancel and was promoted with a free month to stick around, which I took. I didn’t cancel before the end of that month, and was continuing to watch content under the impression I had simply been put back on my old monthly billing cycle since I hadn’t yet cancelled. About 2 months after the free month, I went to cancel again only to see they had actually restarted my subscription at an annual billing rate. They changed my billing terms, pulled almost $60 from my account in the middle of a pandemic, and when I asked for an adjusted refund with the months used deducted, I was provided with a screenshot proving I had been using my account and that these were terms I agreed to. I think it’s beyond sneaky to offer a free month and slip in a complete change of contract, and then do everything in your power to keep someone from recouping their losses. I enjoyed Shudder and would have continued to subscribe on and off as I had been doing, but once the annual cycle is complete I’ll be continuing my crusade to let everyone know this company cheats its loyal customers out of large chunks of money in the most desperate of times.","title":"Billed me for a full year after a free month offer","userName":"aarjh93"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7006581557","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-17T19:53:28Z","rating":5,"review":"Okay so imma just say right now I’m not a bot and this is a genuine review 😭 So I had shudder for a bit, I tried out the free trial but couldn’t afford to upkeep my account.

I emailed them about it and asked if I could get a refund quickly because I do have other payments that need to be taken care of.

At less than $5 a month (with the annual subscription) there’s always something worth watching, and the exclusive content is really high quality. There’s usually something new released every week, which makes it fun to watch and discuss with the community. \n\nMy only real complaints are that I wish the website/account management were a bit more robust. There isn’t really an easy way to do something simple like turn off auto-renewal, or change your plan, without needing to contact support, which can sometimes feel like you’re jumping through hoops (though they are friendly and helpful). Would probably be good if there was 2FA also, since credit card details are stored. \n\nI also find that the Apple TV app has an issue where I constantly get a buffering icon when watching the live Shudder TV feed, despite the video playing normally (doesn’t happen with any of the on demand content).","title":"Hidden gem of a streaming service","userName":"cjrennison"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6641734287","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-11-13T21:27:13Z","rating":1,"review":"I subscribed for a free subscription, but I just didn’t really have time to use it.
