Frontier pioneers and bounty hunters have set carriage treks towards the fabled gold discovery sites in Klondike and Yukon, and to the great plains and deserts of Texas or New Mexico.\n\nYour wagon convoy ran into a bandit ambush and left you behind as the only survivor, but certainly grim with anger to bring those gunslingers to the hangman!

    Excellent Survival Game

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Stumbled upon this game one day when LDoE wasn’t loading. I must say I am truly impressed. It’s based on the same game engine as LDoE but a breathtakingly impressive take on the western genre. It is a lot more FTP (free-to-play) friendly than any of the other survival games out there - I got my horse (the chopper equivalent of LDoE) on my second day of gameplay and the map is peppered with rare resources as well as powerful weapons. You simply must love the repair bench concept where you can repair almost broken rare weapons and armor for a fraction of the crafting cost -probably the best aspect of the game yet !!!! And the new canyon trials have made this game even more FTP friendly for gaining coins, fuel and rare resources. Keep up the good work guys, and make sure you don’t lose sight in the future of what made your game better than LDoE at the start !!!!! Truly an excellent game !!!!<br /><br />UPDATE : After the latest update 0.9.8, my save file has reverted to a month ago. All my progress in the past month or so is lost. Almost 2000 coins, 14 rings, a ton of oats and oak, not to mention a lot of weapons and steel and high end clothes - ALL GONE. No word from the developer yet. Hope I get it back else I&#39;ll probably stop playing. <br /><br />UPDATE: BEST DEVELOPER EVER!!!! THEY RESPONDED AND PROMISED CORRECTIVE ACTION!!!</p>

    Not sure why all the high reviews
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Not sure why the game has such high reviews. I’m guess they are paid for reviews and reviews from devs. I gave the game 3 stars and I think that is a honest and generous amount considering. Let’s start with clothing. Clothing doesn’t drop for squat and it wears out so fast it’s almost a pointless addition to the game, same with weapons and tools.  considering they want real money for chests that may give you a random items that will last you one mission or more if your lucky. Now let’s talk travel. You get 3 chances to run to your locations after that it’s 20 minutes to walk anywhere so in other words it’s almost impossible to get much done in one sit down. <br />  <br /> In a nut shell this game screams give us your money idiots and we are gonna give you as little as possible in return. I find this sad, games like this have such great potential but are always made by greedy people so they are broken from the day it launches. My advise don’t waste your money just play once in a while when your measly energy cap is filled and shoot for lvl power and say F the clothing. Don’t give them a dime till they give us more time to play and have fun for free.<br /><br />   Actually clothing back in the day was made better then it is now. Sorry Even in the Wild Wild West clothing lasted longer then a day lasted longer then  hours that includes bar brawls and shoot outs.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Good day. Armor and weapons can be crafted at the Ranch at any time. To travel more, you can watch ads or use Silver Coins, given for completing daily quests. We&#39;ve also added (on a time-limited basis) a special in-game item that restores Energy, and an item like that will probably become available once again in the future.<br />There is no need to pay unless you want to. Any item and Energy, too, can be obtained via in-game methods. We are sad to read you disliked the game so much but hope that the updates we&#39;ve introduced (and will continue to bring them up) will make you like the game at least a bit more now.<br />Also, just to make it clear, we are not paying for reviews or any opinions left on the Internet. Everyone&#39;s free to write what they have to say, and we are always here to respond to all types of feedback.</p>

    Awesome game but could use a few tweaks

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>First of I would like more weapon variations like maybe a Canadian 1845 carbin and weapons like box guns from the civil war next is more live stock so I know we have hoarse but if you could have cattle and chickens and also breed them that would be AWSOME then another thing is extending the map and more places to go like last day on earth so we have like fortress and even build boats like in grim soul and maybe once in a while a frigate will wash ashore or a whale and we can get whale meet and oil that we can make tar with a new machine called a tar boiler with a new machine called the oil pump so we can pump oil to make tar and lamps and trade it with the trader and with over players at town then we should ad cannons and motors or even howitzers for clan raids and for ranch defense another tip is being able to have a second story for your ranch house I know not many rpg survival games have this but if you did that would be awsome my last suggestion is when the town is out you can you get a career like a chef or soldier or even a contest of who should be the sheriff of the map and that’s it <br /><br />P.S when is the town coming out</p>

We consider it a best practice for you to review the privacy policy of each website you frequent (as well as the privacy policies of any partners we may work with including advertisers) in order to be an informed consumer and to fully understand how your Personal Data is being handled.\r\n\r\nPERSONAL DATA DEFINED\r\n\r\n\"Personal Data\" is information that identifies you or that can be used to contact you (online or offline). Personal Data can include your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, gender, birthdate, etc.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA AND PURPOSES\r\n\r\nWe collect Personal Data in a variety of ways in order to provide you with the best possible experience using our Services. Sources of information include:\r\n\r\nInformation You Provide To Us: You may choose to voluntarily provide us with information by registering or communicating with Helio Games. If you communicate with us, we will collect and record the information you have shared with us so that we can provide you with the Services or address your inquiry. During the registration process, we do collect basic information about you including your name and email address.\r\n\r\nThird Party Platforms and Social Networks: When you participate in our Services which are provided through a Third Party Service, we may obtain information about you from that service such as your name, gender, geographic area and affiliations. For example, we may use your location in association with your user name to display your game score on a top player scoreboard. Your gender designation derived from a Third Party Service may also be shown but your gender will never limit you on the levels that you can achieve while playing the game (which in the free-to-play context reflects skill, not gender) and/or to a specific gameplay style or type of character. As a developer of an application which is provided through a Third Party Service, Helio Games is required to follow the governing policies of such Third Party Service (including the handling of Personal Data).\r\n\r\nIP Addresses: We do monitor and store information about the IP addresses from which you access our Services. In general, these log files are used to monitor traffic on our Services, to troubleshoot technical problems and to collect aggregate information (e.g., to monitor and analyze demographic and preference information among our users). We may block certain IP addresses to comply with specific license agreements and/or in the event we detect user abuse of our Services. IP addresses could also be used to personally identify you in order to enforce our Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nGeolocation: Geolocation refers to the identification of the geographic location of a user or computing device via a variety of data collection mechanisms. Geolocation services use various means to ascertain location including network routing addresses, internal GPS devices and/or the newer W3C Geolocation standard. Our site may use various of these standards depending upon the platform and device that you are using to play our games.\r\n\r\nCookies: Helio Games utilizes cookies in connection with the operation of its Services. If you have registered to use our Services and/or play our games, your consent during the registration process means you have agreed to our use of cookies in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Policy. Cookies are used on our site to facilitate user sign-on, and to retain user preferences and other information. Third party service providers may use cookies to track whether you have clicked on an advertisement and registered to play our games. A “cookie” is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Although your browser may be pre-set to accept cookies, you can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please note, however, that some parts of our Services will not function properly if you disable cookies.\r\n\r\nOther Data Collection Mechanisms: We may employ technologies including (i) clear Graphics Interchange Formats (“GIFs”) (i.e., web bugs, beacons or tags), which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation or registration; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to prevent fraud, remember your progress on certain in-game tasks and in-game settings. Clear GIFs are not used to collect Personal Data about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page.\r\n\r\nAGGREGATED DATA; NON-PERSONAL DATA GATHERING AND ANALYTICS\r\n\r\nIn addition to Personal Data, we collect a variety of data that is not used to specifically identify or contact you.

For example, we may monitor the number and type of activities you participate in during a particular session, your scores and the length of time you spend on our Services.\r\n\r\nAnalytic Metrics Tool and Other Technologies: Helio Games uses its own tools and technologies to analyze non-Personal Data when you use our Services The information collected may include data about your hardware system, mobile device (if applicable), media, Internet and website usage and how you use our Services.

If such a third party provides us with your Personal Data, we will handle it in accordance with this privacy policy.\r\n\r\nUSER GENERATED CONTENT\r\n\r\nUser generated content includes various types of content which is publicly available and is produced by end users. For example, wall posts, messages, and actions with other end users would fall under this definition. It is possible that the user generated content you choose to provide may contain Personal Data. Please be aware that we cannot guarantee protection for information you make available publicly through comments, information sharing mechanisms, wall posts, etc. Any user generated content you share while using our Services on a social network, will very likely be disseminated broadly through the social network. Also, any Personal Data that is publicly shared by the user could be harvested by third parties (including by other users of the social network) with access to it and we cannot control those third parties' use of such information. Please bear these factors in mind before sharing any content with us.\r\n\r\nWHAT WE DO NOT DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThird Party Services - Social Network Data: We do not directly or indirectly transfer any Personal Data we receive from social networks such as Facebook or Google Play to third parties.

In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\nIn the event that we no longer operate a specific game through our Services, we may work with the subsequent game operator to offer you the ability to continue to play the game with the new game operator. This might involve inviting you to create a new user name and password in order to continue playing the game with the new game operator.\r\n\r\nIf material changes to Helio Games's privacy practices will occur as a result of a business transition, we will notify you and other users of the business transition prior to transferring your Personal Data as set forth below under Changes to Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\nSECURITY OF OUR SERVICES\r\n\r\nWe use encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of the information that you share with us.

Any links you see adjacent to our Services may link you to parties completely unrelated to Helio Games. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for your use of their services or for any use of your Personal Data by such third parties and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as ourselves. The presence of a third party link within the Services does not represent an endorsement of the content of that third party's link and Helio Games disclaims all liability arising from such content.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL\r\n\r\nPersonal data provided to Helio Games will be collected, processed and stored by Helio Games in the European Union.\r\n\r\nAs part of our international operations, our Affiliates have access to such personal identifiable information data for our legitimate business purposes.

We consider it a best practice for you to review the privacy policy of each website you frequent (as well as the privacy policies of any partners we may work with including advertisers) in order to be an informed consumer and to fully understand how your Personal Data is being handled.\r\n\r\nPERSONAL DATA DEFINED\r\n\r\n\"Personal Data\" is information that identifies you or that can be used to contact you (online or offline). Personal Data can include your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, gender, birthdate, etc.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA AND PURPOSES\r\n\r\nWe collect Personal Data in a variety of ways in order to provide you with the best possible experience using our Services. Sources of information include:\r\n\r\nInformation You Provide To Us: You may choose to voluntarily provide us with information by registering or communicating with Helio Games. If you communicate with us, we will collect and record the information you have shared with us so that we can provide you with the Services or address your inquiry. During the registration process, we do collect basic information about you including your name and email address.\r\n\r\nThird Party Platforms and Social Networks: When you participate in our Services which are provided through a Third Party Service, we may obtain information about you from that service such as your name, gender, geographic area and affiliations. For example, we may use your location in association with your user name to display your game score on a top player scoreboard. Your gender designation derived from a Third Party Service may also be shown but your gender will never limit you on the levels that you can achieve while playing the game (which in the free-to-play context reflects skill, not gender) and/or to a specific gameplay style or type of character. As a developer of an application which is provided through a Third Party Service, Helio Games is required to follow the governing policies of such Third Party Service (including the handling of Personal Data).\r\n\r\nIP Addresses: We do monitor and store information about the IP addresses from which you access our Services. In general, these log files are used to monitor traffic on our Services, to troubleshoot technical problems and to collect aggregate information (e.g., to monitor and analyze demographic and preference information among our users). We may block certain IP addresses to comply with specific license agreements and/or in the event we detect user abuse of our Services. IP addresses could also be used to personally identify you in order to enforce our Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nGeolocation: Geolocation refers to the identification of the geographic location of a user or computing device via a variety of data collection mechanisms. Geolocation services use various means to ascertain location including network routing addresses, internal GPS devices and/or the newer W3C Geolocation standard.

If you have registered to use our Services and/or play our games, your consent during the registration process means you have agreed to our use of cookies in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Policy. Cookies are used on our site to facilitate user sign-on, and to retain user preferences and other information. Third party service providers may use cookies to track whether you have clicked on an advertisement and registered to play our games.

I must say I am truly impressed. It’s based on the same game engine as LDoE but a breathtakingly impressive take on the western genre. It is a lot more FTP (free-to-play) friendly than any of the other survival games out there - I got my horse (the chopper equivalent of LDoE) on my second day of gameplay and the map is peppered with rare resources as well as powerful weapons. You simply must love the repair bench concept where you can repair almost broken rare weapons and armor for a fraction of the crafting cost -probably the best aspect of the game yet !!!! And the new canyon trials have made this game even more FTP friendly for gaining coins, fuel and rare resources. Keep up the good work guys, and make sure you don’t lose sight in the future of what made your game better than LDoE at the start !!!!! Truly an excellent game !!!!\n\nUPDATE : After the latest update 0.9.8, my save file has reverted to a month ago. All my progress in the past month or so is lost. Almost 2000 coins, 14 rings, a ton of oats and oak, not to mention a lot of weapons and steel and high end clothes - ALL GONE. No word from the developer yet.

I’m guess they are paid for reviews and reviews from devs. I gave the game 3 stars and I think that is a honest and generous amount considering. Let’s start with clothing. Clothing doesn’t drop for squat and it wears out so fast it’s almost a pointless addition to the game, same with weapons and tools.  considering they want real money for chests that may give you a random items that will last you one mission or more if your lucky. Now let’s talk travel. You get 3 chances to run to your locations after that it’s 20 minutes to walk anywhere so in other words it’s almost impossible to get much done in one sit down. \n  \n In a nut shell this game screams give us your money idiots and we are gonna give you as little as possible in return. I find this sad, games like this have such great potential but are always made by greedy people so they are broken from the day it launches. My advise don’t waste your money just play once in a while when your measly energy cap is filled and shoot for lvl power and say F the clothing. Don’t give them a dime till they give us more time to play and have fun for free.\n\n   Actually clothing back in the day was made better then it is now.

Sick of the survival games all being against zombies so figured I’d try this game. I just started playing the game. Still low lvl only lvl 5 but so far there’s 2 big things that irk the hell out of me. One problem is functional and the another is aesthetic. \nFirst problem, your hunger and thirst meters don’t show while ur running around playing the game. U have to go into the inventory menu view to see the hunger and thirst meters which is highly annoying. Seems like a no brained that your hunger and thirst meters should show next to the health meter without having to go into a menu to view them. Duh.\nSecond problem is just aesthetic but also seems like a common sense thing as well. For some reason u can only play as a pale old white guy. U can change ur player name but apparently u can’t change anything about how ur player looks. So every humanoid character in the game all seems pale white males. U should give people the options of changing their characters sex, skin color, hair color, maybe even hair style. \nAlso, side note but a bit disappointed to see there’s zombies in the game.

It use to be hard before in those locations now it’s just insane you can’t even look in a bag without 20+ guys on you that just keep appearing. You go through so many guns, clothes and meds and still don’t find the 3 pieces of the map before you die over and over. Then with an hour and 45 min time limit, it’s not happening. I agree with a lot of other reviews, with losing stuff so Frequently now it takes way to much to make new stuff and the fact that you have to go to these places that are insanely crazy with bad guys to TRY to get more items it’s very frustrating. Not even mention the fact that your items diminishes so quickly now. I have a screen shot of ash with 35 Xs around me and I didn’t even leave that little area between the water, they just kept coming and I still didn’t find any maps. PLEASE put it back to the way it was or a little harder but not this insane!!!! I love this game and would like to continue playing but it’s not worth it if it’s insanely hard to do anything.

It WAS by far the most enjoyable of the survival type games out there. However, the developers seem to be on the profit driven quest. The updates are the biggest headaches of this game. First, it takes months to incorporate features that are “ in the game but not yet available” and when they do they decide to change some other aspect of gameplay for seemingly no other reason other than to force you to spend money. I began regularly purchasing the monthly VIP to make gameplay more enjoyable and to support the game. This provides gameplay perks as well as in- game currency. After one of their recent buggy updates all the in game currency I had saved in my inbox mysteriously vanished. Contacted the developers on multiple channels just to wait weeks for a “ tell us your problem” response followed by weeks of silence. If your looking for something to pass the time that’s not aliens and zombies, by all means download this game. However, I would HIGHLY suggest you save your hard earned money for a game with less bugs and the developers actually follow up with your issues in a timely manner. If you notice all the lower ratings are from veteran players so that should be a red flag. Until they can work out the bugs, my money will go to another game.","title":"Keep your money!","userName":"robbed by bugs"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7616565362","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-07-25T14:11:52Z","developerResponse":{"id":24155386,"body":"Good day.

You may have just lost one of your higher spending customers. I’m going to try to play the best I can without spending more than I already am but I don’t think it’s going to be possible. Even though I have all the materials necessary to repair a simple Iron axe or pick, and I have a work bench that could create such an item, I can no longer repair it on my repair bench?This makes no sense and is absolutely frustrating. When it comes to higher level items that I bought, especially weapons, it is even more frustrating. It was already hard to repair these items but now it’s practically impossible.I’m going to be much less apt to spend money on a weapon that is just going to wear out quickly and be really hard to fix and use again.

The 4 stars is based on the redundancy of the game because you are always farming the same things and re-invading the same areas countless times just to get into another area that you can raid only one time. The basic things you need in the game are always in demand and it takes a long time to get what you need. The advanced stuff is so difficult compared to the basics to get and gather that I would recommend a little balancing. Look forward to see what they have in store and what the game has in store. Could be awesome and thank you for a good game.\n\nUpdate - 2/25: This new update made me put then game down today for the first time ever. Spent a couple months learning the game and upgrading (over half my house is stone) what I learned worked. Found the best hand weapon and rifle combo that I could repair. Have not died in weeks except one time when I was not watching my thirst. Today I died twice including once against a bear and NPC when I had my best hand weapon and was at almost full health. My resources are being sucked up quicker than I can make them and I don’t trust to put it on autopilot after today’s update. Yeah... fix that and I’ll be back","title":"In the process of","userName":"Tag pictures"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1396668665","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"Contains
