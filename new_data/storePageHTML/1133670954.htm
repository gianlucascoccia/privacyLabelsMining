        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I started using Spark 4 years ago. It was exactly what I wanted and imagined - a simple video app that can help me document my travels. The simplicity of the interface makes a world of difference! You simply film along, a few seconds at a time, your trip, and in the end easily turn it into a music video that you can look back on. However, at the time the app was far from perfect. It didn’t have transitions so the video always cut off in an abrupt way. But what I love the most about this app is that the people behind it keep improving it over the years! I wrote to them and right away they wrote me back this nice email telling me about new functions they added to help me achieve a smoother fade-in and fade-out. I also told them my problems with sound transition. And literally the next update came with just the functions I needed. I can’t say it was my suggestion that prompted this, but I do know that they genuinely listen to their users’ feedback and are making the app better all the time! For that reason alone, Spark is so worth supporting because its makers genuinely care about how us users feel and they incorporate our feedback. Keep up the good work Team Spark! I now have over 80 videos of travel memories to look back on, I look forward to making many many many more ❤️</p>

    The Only Video App I Use

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have used this app for 5 years now, trying others as they came along. The rest got deleted, even the paid ones, but this one remains. It was not right away that I became comfortable with its minimalistic interface, but when I got used to it, it made sense and I actually like it now, because it is not loaded with options I never use. <br />The concept is this: you create a “spark”, which is just a smart way of grouping related video clips together and working with them, editing, rearranging, adding transitions, music, etc, until you are ready to produce a video with merged clips. You can have as many “sparks” as you want, and go between them any time you want. <br />A pretty looking app and a smart way of keeping all of your themed clips in one place. <br />The customer service is superb too, responsive and polite. Dominique rules!<br />Long live Spark!</p>

    Great app but some issues
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Really love the app. I use it every day as a way to record my own personal daily vlogs. But there are times when I’m exporting that when it completes the ring it doesn’t do anything. It just waits. So I usually have to force close reopen then try again. Usually it’ll work again but gets frustrating waiting twice. The other thing is after recording a fairly long single clip (&gt; 50 sec) there’s a bit of a delay before I can start recording again. Sometimes I immediately press to record but if it’s in the middle of that delay it doesn’t capture anything. So I end up wasting a shot. And the last issue I’d really love to have and been asking for a few years now is to have orientation lock. I shoot in landscape and because you don’t have a lock I need to keep my phone “orientation free” to accommodate Spark. It’s not a big deal most of the time except when I’m lying down on my side and everything rotates. So having a lock on the video orientation would be great. <br /><br />Otherwise great app!</p>

It was exactly what I wanted and imagined - a simple video app that can help me document my travels. The simplicity of the interface makes a world of difference! You simply film along, a few seconds at a time, your trip, and in the end easily turn it into a music video that you can look back on. However, at the time the app was far from perfect. It didn’t have transitions so the video always cut off in an abrupt way. But what I love the most about this app is that the people behind it keep improving it over the years! I wrote to them and right away they wrote me back this nice email telling me about new functions they added to help me achieve a smoother fade-in and fade-out. I also told them my problems with sound transition. And literally the next update came with just the functions I needed. I can’t say it was my suggestion that prompted this, but I do know that they genuinely listen to their users’ feedback and are making the app better all the time! For that reason alone, Spark is so worth supporting because its makers genuinely care about how us users feel and they incorporate our feedback. Keep up the good work Team Spark! I now have over 80 videos of travel memories to look back on, I look forward to making many many many more ❤️","title":"My Favorite App of All Time, My Memory Maker","userName":"ElanorMc"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4121891380","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-05-09T04:10:19Z","rating":5,"review":"I have used this app for 5 years now, trying others as they came along. The rest got deleted, even the paid ones, but this one remains. It was not right away that I became comfortable with its minimalistic interface, but when I got used to it, it made sense and I actually like it now, because it is not loaded with options I never use. \nThe concept is this: you create a “spark”, which is just a smart way of grouping related video clips together and working with them, editing, rearranging, adding transitions, music, etc, until you are ready to produce a video with merged clips. You can have as many “sparks” as you want, and go between them any time you want. \nA pretty looking app and a smart way of keeping all of your themed clips in one place. \nThe customer service is superb too, responsive and polite.

But there are times when I’m exporting that when it completes the ring it doesn’t do anything. It just waits. So I usually have to force close reopen then try again. Usually it’ll work again but gets frustrating waiting twice. The other thing is after recording a fairly long single clip (\u003e 50 sec) there’s a bit of a delay before I can start recording again. Sometimes I immediately press to record but if it’s in the middle of that delay it doesn’t capture anything. So I end up wasting a shot. And the last issue I’d really love to have and been asking for a few years now is to have orientation lock. I shoot in landscape and because you don’t have a lock I need to keep my phone “orientation free” to accommodate Spark. It’s not a big deal most of the time except when I’m lying down on my side and everything rotates. So having a lock on the video orientation would be great. \n\nOtherwise great app!","title":"Great app but some issues","userName":"jaybroho"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6403163316","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-07T02:40:26Z","developerResponse":{"id":2368082,"body":"Thank you for your detailed feedback.

I muted the videos and still here noise where clips are joined. After adding music it gets quieter also in between clips. \n\nIt turns out that my new iPhone has issues with playing videos across various apps, not just this app, so restarting my phone after turning the “auto play videos” back to ON in settings, and this app no longer blacks out clips and my photo roll no longer gets errors on videos. Weird that it worked. Thought my phone was going nuts, seems to be an iOS  issue. \n\nOriginal review. \nRecently, the app started blacking out clips, every other one while still retaining audio.  Could be because I offloaded the app and then reloaded?  Either way I am done with it, deleting today for good.  It was fun for a while to do quick edits, but it seems pricey to upgrade and has issues.  Couldn’t export videos today, I thought to see if it will export with the blackout parts, but now I am so annoyed I won’t even bother saving my videos and just will delete it all.  I use FinalCutpro for more demanding work but at times need quick on the go edits/tests.  Still looking for “the one”.   No 4K with the free version anymore, which is understandable, but there are other annoyances that keep pushing me away.  I was fascinated with this app some years back, but now it feels like maybe it needs a redesign, a lower price tag or maybe I’ve just outgrown it.","title":"Sound issue","userName":"Don'tWantToType"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6689788368","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-11-27T02:53:22Z","developerResponse":{"id":19438052,"body":"Hel­­­­­­­­lo There!

THE issue I found is when it comes to adding music to your video even if your purchased the song on your iTunes they only allow certain songs in your videos. I can’t understand what ones are allowed and not allowed. It’s a random guess. You will get denied and sent to iTunes that gives you no help or resources on how to fix it or why you were denied. Then! If you are allowed to have a song instead of listing to it first with a short clip. They just add it to the video. Then you have to delete it and start all over again. \n\nNext Is text. If you just want a quick text to pop up and show the name of a person in the video. You can shorten it to seconds.

Made everything super easy to edit in a minute, all features were easy to use, and I had my videos ready in half the time of other apps. BUT whatever they changed in the last update has ruined this app for me. Videos that used to take seconds to upload into a project now take up to 2 mins each (and when you’re uploading 10 clips at a time that’s a long time to wait before you can even begin editing). The start and end markers for each video clip are now impossible to grab with your finger resulting in an infuriating battle of closing the clip, reopening it, trying to move the end marker and closing the clip by accident again because it misreads what my finger is trying to do.

Although, I still feel like the fact the link is inactive for members to click, I thank the team for fixing the situation for me. \n\nPrevious Review: I purchased this app long before they went to a subscription model and was told I would have most of the features being an early adopter. I hadn’t used the app in a while due to busy life at home during quarantine, but opened the app today to create something. I was prompted to upgrade to pro. Then when try and click the ‘Already a Member?’ link, it’s not clickable. It’s right where you swipe with your thumb so it’s impossible. I can't back a company that does this. I definitely won’t be upgrading to the subscription.

So I thought ok why not. Then my bank was charged for the year and now I can cancel but I’m still out the money and have this for a year. Do not waste time and cash. If your seriously working your business on insta or wherever. Try a different company. If they would do this then the software can’t be trusted. Bad business practice ***update** in response to the developer. I know you need paid if someone uses your product. I run a business myself and understand completely but I noticed the charge minutes after clicking try for free. I canceled it immediately. Doesn’t get me my money back and it wasn’t 3 hours I had it let alone 3 days. I’m not a moron and I’m also not trying to take advantage of the situation in anyway. I stand by my review.

So I say download app and I download it. I go in and it’s like “hey here you go, the app is free but you have to pay for everything else except the taking video part. Have fun doing nothing!” Like if you are going to charge people for your app, MAKE IT A FREAKING PAID APP!!! Maybe the stuff is good once you pay for it but if you are looking for a good video editing software that is free AND HONEST, get a different app! I’m not going to add more money onto my other monthly payments for something that can obviously be replaced. Just make the right choice people, if your willing to pay for some video thing that is charging you by the month for some filters and video cutting, go right ahead! I’ll sit back with a phone camera and apple filters and be just fine.
