        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I used to plan to my trips using trip advisor, however they took away the ability to schedule items within each day of the trip. I tried using Google Trips, Tripline, and any other app that was recommended for trip planning. Sygic is the only one I have tried which had all the options I needed. Some of the features I appreciate include: being able to select multiple types of transportation for each day. If I am trying to plan a route on google maps for a day it won’t let me switch between using a car and using public transportation. Sygic let’s me decide for each destination whether I want to drive, take public, transportation, etc. The app also estimates based on the activities and routes how long of a day it will be. I used to manually estimate how long I would spend at each place I wanted to visit based on googles average for how long people spend there. Sygic automatically has an estimate for each travel site already. Also those times can be adjusted if needed. <br />The premium feature of printing trips to PDF is also great. The PDF looks great and includes the travel guides for the cities you are visiting. <br />Overall the app has everything I want from a trip planning app and I looking forward to continuing to use it for many more trips to come!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I am writing this review from my hotel room in Venice and have been traveling throughout Europe. I cannot explain how invaluable this app has been to me thus far. I paid for the premium version and it was well worth it. I have had cell data turned off my entire trip but this app has helped me navigate the complicated streets of several cities despite having my data turned off (I don&#39;t know how- but it is not using data). It is amazing, i planned my entire month long trip using the app. When I had questions, I emailed the developers and received prompt responses. It has been the best purchase that I have ever made from the App Store. I highly recommend it!!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Just started using this app and I like how easy it is to plan your itinerary out. Even share it. The biggest problem I have is being able to use my choice of navigation. I’d like to be able to use Google Maps or Apple maps for directions but it forces you to use their GPS solution, which then requires an additional purchase to get turn by turn directions!<br /><br />Update: User error. Sygic actually uses Apple’s way of doing their settings so it wasn’t apparent to the user. Support is correct and you can change the default navigation app. Home Screen/Springboard &gt; Settings &gt; Sygic Travel. Amazing. The only issue I have is the app should walk you through an initial setup to get these things sorted out. With this fixed definitely an app I could recommend to others. Transferring my itinerary back to this now. Thank you!</p>

This privacy policy provides an overview about how we process personal data about users of our mobile applications, software, websites or generally our products and services we provide to you (the “Services”).\n\nOur privacy commitment\n\nWe take privacy very seriously. Being an EU-based company, we must comply with the EU general data protection regulation (the „GDPR“) when processing the personal data. We provide our Services either directly to natural person end-users or to our business clients in which case we process personal data about their employees or users. We regard all natural person users of our Services data subjects according to the GDPR.\n\nContact us\n\nIf you have any questions concerning how we process your personal data, you can contact us at privacy@sygic.com or by post using our registered seat address above. All privacy enquiries sent to us are received and reviewed by our data protection officer (‘DPO’) appointed to serve as a contact point for you and supervisory authorities.\nWhy do we process your personal data?\n\nGenerally, we need to process your personal data in order to provide the Services, meet our legal or contractual obligations and pursue our legitimate software developer interests. In particular, we process your personal data for the following purposes:\n\nProvision of the Services - Performance of contract pursuant to the Art. 6(1)(b) of the GDPR\nDevelopment, improvement \u0026 testing - Legitimate interest pursuant to the Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR\nDirect marketing communications (newsletter \u0026 push notifications) - Consent pursuant to the Art. 6(1)(a) of the GDPR or similar products or services\nMarketing analytics - Legitimate interest pursuant to the Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR\nStatistics - Article 89 of the GDPR\nMaintaining social media profiles - Legitimate interest pursuant to the Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR\nConsumer contests - Performance of contract pursuant to the Art. 6(1)(b) of the GDPR\nBilling, Tax \u0026 Accounting - Compliance with legal obligations pursuant to the Art. 6(1)(c) of the GDPR\nSecurity of personal data - Compliance with legal obligation the Art. 6(1)(c) of the GDPR\nHandling user requests - Compliance with legal obligation the Art. 6(1)(c) of the GDPR\nLegal enforcement - Legitimate interest pursuant to the Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR\n\nWhat do these purposes mean?\n\nProvision of the Services\nEvery time you download any application from Sygic whether through Google Play, iTunes, Sygic E-Shop, or other stores, you agree to and conclude with us the End-User-Licence-Agreement which represents a contract concluded between us (“EULA”). According to EULA, we are obliged to provide you with the Services which correspond to the specific functionality of the particular application and your in-product purchases. Any processing which is necessary to perform our obligations from the EULA as explained above is regarded a separate purpose of processing and is not subject to a separate data subject consent. For example, this includes:\n- Ensuring the basic functionality and additional functionality of the application (add-ons, features);\n- User registration and administration of the user accounts (user login);\n- Customer pre-contractual relationship management;\n- Handling orders and purchases via app or e-shop;\n- Recommendations for better user experience;\n- Customer support; or\n- Communication of service information to user.\n\nDevelopment, improvement \u0026 testing\nAs a software developer we need to be able to continuously develop, improve, maintain and test our software products which we regard our own legitimate interest. This typically includes:\n- Removal of bugs and other software faults or errors;\n- Development of new application updates, versions or functionalities (features);\n- General analysis of application;\n- Analysis of user trends within the application including general user profiling based on that;\n- Accuracy analysis (location, speed, direction or other values);\n- Customer polls focused on improvement of the Services;\n- Customer feedback on design and user experience;\n- Testing on the production copies of partially anonymized data.\n\nDirect marketing communications (newsletter \u0026 push notifications)\nWe do not send-out direct marketing communication to everyone. If you receive a direct marketing message from us it’s either because you have previously granted us a specific direct marketing consent or because we have obtained your email within the process of providing you with our Services and the message relates to a similar product or service. Irrespective of that, you can always opt-out from receiving any further direct marketing communication and/or object to processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes as explained below.\n\nMarketing analytics\nWe regard our marketing analytics a distinct purpose of processing personal data from sending out direct marketing communications. Some of the below activities might not necessarily involve processing of personal data. However, we would like to be transparent about the processing activities we undertake (with data generally) and would like to give our users full control over marketing related processing of personal data, as explained here. All of the below activities do correspond with our legitimate interest of better understanding our customers, customer trends and expectations when providing or offering our Services. For example, marketing analytics may include:\n- General analysis of user behavior for better marketing strategies, decision or more personalized targeted advertising;\n- Targeted advertising of Sygic products or services for example via Facebook App Install ads, Google AdWords, PayPerClick and similar tools;\n- Performance analysis of different marketing campaigns (e.g. Exponea, Google Analytics);\n- Cross-device linking (pairing of data about different devices of the same user);\n- User segmentation for more personalized direct marketing communication (if conditions for direct marketing communications are met).\n\nStatistics\nWe keep various anonymous or aggregated statistics based on which one cannot identify an individual. For example, we might keep statistics about how many users are using our applications or what is the average usage time of our applications. Although these statistics are made by conversion or analysis of real personal data, the statistic findings or results are not personal data.\n\nMaintaining social media profiles\nWe maintain several business profiles on social media platforms where you can interact or communicate with us. By doing so, we are pursuing our legitimate interest: increasing company/brand awareness in online environment. We might process your personal data via our social media profiles when you write to us, comment, like or share our posts. Your provision of personal data via social media to us is voluntary. Please read relevant privacy policies to better understand processing of your personal data by providers of social media platforms. We only have a typical admin control over the personal data processed by us via our own company profiles. We assume that by using these social media platforms, you understand that your personal data might be processed for other purposes and that your personal data might by transferred to other third countries and third parties by providers of social media platforms. You can currently find us on Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Youtube, Stack Overflow, Github, Tumblr, Dribble and Behance.\n\nConsumer contests\nWe might organize customer contests, price giveaways or similar promotional activities for example via our social media profiles. When we do so, we typically put forwards terms \u0026 conditions or statute which you need to accept before joining the contest. By doing so, you conclude a contract with us meaning we do not need your consent for participation and related processing of your personal data. However, we would always ask your consent should the circumstances require so.\n\nBilling, Tax \u0026 Accounting\nWhen you purchase any paid add-on, feature or application from us, we must process your personal data in line with the applicable billing, tax and accounting legislation. Invoices and invoicing documentation might include your personal data. However, we are obliged to process, keep and store such data for statutory periods in order to be compliant with local law. Specific provisions of billing, tax and accounting legislation might vary across different jurisdictions.\n\nSecurity of personal data\nWe are obliged to adopt measures to ensure appropriate level of personal data security. Although these measures are not primarily directed for processing of personal data (which is rather a by-product of their purpose), processing of your personal data to some necessary extent might be needed in order for these measures to be implemented (for example encryption, pseudonymization, logging, backups, crash reporting, breach/incident reporting, security investigations and documentations, access control, harmful content detection, etc.).\n\nHandling user requests\nEvery time we are legally required to handle your requests, we must necessarily process your personal data. For example, when you approach us with request based on your data subject rights stemming from GDPR, we must process your personal data in order to comply with GDPR requirements.\n\nLegal enforcement\nFrom time to time, we might need to pursue a legal claim, ask for compensation or off-court settlement, keep evidence for potential dispute, manage legal contracts, request legal advice from external advisors, report illegal activity to law enforcement authorities or otherwise protect our legitimate legal interests (i.e. enforcing our legal rights). Although these activities do not automatically involve processing of personal data about our users (which happens very rarely), we would like to be transparent about such purpose of processing in case it does.\nBy virtue of this privacy policy, all of the above purposes are determined by us generally against all users of our Services from the moment of their collection despite the fact that the actual processing operation or purpose might not be relevant to every individual in every case. From this reason, we do not regard these as “other” purposes pursuant to Art. 6(4) of the GDPR which would require us to inform you about such purposes once they become relevant in future.\n\nHow do we collect your personal data?\n\nGenerally, we collect your personal data directly from you (source), for example when you decide to download our app, make a purchase, register your account, fill-out marketing consent form, contact us or otherwise use our Services. Provision of personal data to us by you might happen directly, for example by filling-out registration, order or consent form but might also happen indirectly for example by using our apps which need to collect data in order to operate and in order to provide you with the Services requested. For example, when using our navigation or localization apps, we must collect your precise location, speed and bearings. Provision of personal data by you is voluntary or presents either a requirement to enter into a contract or a contractual requirement (EULA). Certain processing of personal data might be required by law or required by us in order to pursue our own legitimate interests, as explained above. However, if you decide not to provide us your personal data in the first place, these additional statutory or legitimate interest provisions of data should not happen.\n\nWho are recipients of your personal data?\n\nWe take the confidentiality of your personal data very seriously and have policies in place to ensure that your data is only shared with authorized personnel of Sygic or a verified third party. Our employees might have access to your personal data on a strictly need-to-know basis typically governed and limited by function, role and department of the particular employee. We also use sub-contractors to support us in providing the Services who might process personal data for us. We ensure that selection of our sub-contractors and any processing of personal data by them is compliant with the GDPR. Categories of recipients of your personal data are:\n- Affiliated Sygic companies;\n- Hosting or cloud services providers;\n- Marketing and analytics software service providers;\n- Social media platform operators;\n- Authorized personnel of the above.\n- We share anonymous and aggregated data which is not linkable to an individual with our business partners. We make sure such data is not a personal data.\n\nWhat countries do we transfer your personal data to?\n\nBy default, we seek not to transfer your personal data outside the EU and/or European Economic Area where not necessary. However, some of our sub-contractors or the above-mentioned recipients of personal data might be based or their servers might be located in the United States of America (U.S.). As such, US is regarded a third party not ensuring adequate level of protection. However, companies certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield mechanism according to the EU Commision (Text of the Commission’s EU-US Privacy Shield Decision) are regarded as ensuring adequate level of protection. Any transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area is done by us only under strict compliance with the GDPR. We ensure the third-party recipients are either certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield, concluded EU model clauses with us or follow equivalent safeguards in place.\n\nHow long we store your personal data?\n\nWe must not and we do not want to store your personal data for longer than necessary for the given purpose of processing. Due to this legal requirement but also due to technical and financial aspects of data storage we actively delete data where no longer necessary. In general, storage periods of the following purposes are linked to active usage of our apps and the actual data on our product servers at the given time:\n- Provision of the Services\n- Development, improvement \u0026 testing\n- Marketing analytics\n- Statistics\n- Security of personal data\n\nThis means (in general) that if you stop using our app, we stop processing your personal data for the above purposes of processing. If you uninstall our app, we delete personal data collected by the app. However, depending on the circumstances we delete some data sooner or later than that, for example:\n- Data used for application improvement after 3 months\n- Security and system logs after 1 year\n- Back-ups for security purposes after 3 years\n\nSome of our users might have a life-time license for our apps. In that case, we must store credentials of the license holder for a period equivalent to “life-time” period which is 90 years from license purchase. If you request us to erase your personal data including your license credentials we can do so, but you will loose the life-time license as well (i.e. you will no longer be in the list of license holders). Please note that if you then decide to use our apps again in the future, you might not be able to rely on your license unless you prove to us that you had the license before. We therefore suggest you keep evidence of our communication about the license credentials erasure.\nAs regards the purpose of direct marketing communications (newsletter \u0026 push notifications), the storage period generally lasts until you revoke your consent (opt-out) or object against direct marketing.\nAs regards Billing, Tax \u0026 Accounting purposes the retention period are governed by local law and depending on the type of information or document in which billing personal data might be included the storage period is 10 years.\nIt stems from the nature of social media profiles that we do not actively delete the history of our profiles, but you are free do so or request us to do so at any time. We delete old private messages via social media once every 3 years.\nIn general, storage periods for consumer contests is the duration of the contest.\nAs regards handling user requests and legal enforcement, we might keep your personal data if we believe it might be necessary for us in court, criminal or administrative proceedings in the future. General limitation period under Slovak law is 3 years.\n\nWhat rights do you have?\n\nYou have right to object to any processing that is based on legitimate interest including to profiling based on such legitimate interest pursuant to the Article 21 GDPR.\nWe rely on legitimate interest for purposes of Development, improvement \u0026 testing, Marketing analytics, Maintaining social media profiles and Legal enforcement.\nYou also have a right to object to any direct marketing processing of your personal data including profiling.\nIf we process your personal data, you have so-called data subject rights under the Article 15 to 22 of the GDPR. Among others, you have right to request access to your personal data, rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing or right to object to processing as well as the right to data portability. However, these are not absolute rights and they only exist if the relevant conditions are met. For example, right for erasure does not apply in case when such personal data is required for compliance with legal obligation (Billing, Tax \u0026 Accounting) or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (Legal enforcement). Please contact us at privacy@sygic.com if you have a general query about your data subject rights.\nYou have a right to lodge a complaint related to personal data to the relevant data protection supervisory authority. Please note that our lead data protection authority is the Office for Protection of Personal Data of the Slovak Republic.\nIf you are not sure about whether we process your personal data, you can request our confirmation by reference to the right of access under the Art. 15(1) of the GDPR. If we do process your personal data you can request the following information:\n- the purposes of the processing;\n- the categories of personal data concerned;\n- the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organizations;\n- where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;\n- the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing;\n- the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;\n- where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;\n- the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.\nPlease note, that if you use our apps, most of the above information is already included in this privacy policy. You have also right to request copy of your personal data pursuant to the Art. 15(3) of the GDPR. You have right to request some of your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format provided that the conditions for data portability under Art. 20 of the GDPR are met. These conditions might be met where the legal basis for processing is your consent or performance of contract (provision of the Services, newsletters and consumer contest) where you provide the personal data to us.\nWhen we process your personal data based on your consent, you can always revoke your consent at any time. You can always use our general contact details for revoking consent or objecting to processing. In case of email newsletters, you will find opt-out button at the bottom of every direct marketing email.\nIf you feel that we are processing incorrect personal data about you given the purpose and circumstances and you cannot change such personal data via functionality of the app, account or website, you can request rectification of incorrect or incomplete personal data using the below supplementary statement (all information is voluntary) and/or our general contact details:\n\nSupplementary statement for rectification of personal data\nYour name and surname:\t\nAccount email:\t\nType of Sygic service used:\t (Please indicate what application, website or service your request relates to)\nNature of your rectification:\t(Please explain whether you would like to request correction of incorrect or completion of incomplete personal data)\nContext of your rectification request: (Please explain us why you believe we are processing incorrect or incomplete data)\nRectification:\t(Please express the correction or completion of the particular personal data you are requesting)\nThis supplementary statement for rectification can be send to Sygic at privacy@sygic.com\nWhen enforcing your data subject rights, please be as explicit and detailed as possible. Otherwise, we might respond with request to clarify a generic, vague or too general requests which in turn delays getting the information you request.\n\nCookies\n\nWhen processing your personal data, operating our websites or generally providing or supporting our Services we may use cookies and similar technologies. Specifically, we use these technologies for Direct marketing communications (newsletter \u0026 push notifications) and Marketing analytics. You have a control about the use of cookies via setting of your internet browser, where you can disable cookies at any time.\n\nChanges to this privacy policy\n\nWe may change this privacy policy from time to time by posting the most current privacy policy and its effective date on our website. In case we change this privacy policy substantially, we may bring such changes to your attention by explicit notice in our apps, on our websites or by email.","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Discover new places"},"is32bitOnly":false,"isStandaloneWithCompanionForWatchOS":false,"seller":"Tripomatic s.r.o.","isSiriSupported":false,"languageList":["English","Czech","Dutch","French","German","Greek","Hungarian","Italian","Korean","Polish","Portuguese","Romanian","Russian","Simplified Chinese","Slovak","Spanish","Swedish","Turkish"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"description":{"standard":"Discover the world through immersive 360° videos and beautiful photos.

According to EULA, we are obliged to provide you with the Services which correspond to the specific functionality of the particular application and your in-product purchases. Any processing which is necessary to perform our obligations from the EULA as explained above is regarded a separate purpose of processing and is not subject to a separate data subject consent. For example, this includes:\n- Ensuring the basic functionality and additional functionality of the application (add-ons, features);\n- User registration and administration of the user accounts (user login);\n- Customer pre-contractual relationship management;\n- Handling orders and purchases via app or e-shop;\n- Recommendations for better user experience;\n- Customer support; or\n- Communication of service information to user.\n\nDevelopment, improvement \u0026 testing\nAs a software developer we need to be able to continuously develop, improve, maintain and test our software products which we regard our own legitimate interest.

If you receive a direct marketing message from us it’s either because you have previously granted us a specific direct marketing consent or because we have obtained your email within the process of providing you with our Services and the message relates to a similar product or service. Irrespective of that, you can always opt-out from receiving any further direct marketing communication and/or object to processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes as explained below.\n\nMarketing analytics\nWe regard our marketing analytics a distinct purpose of processing personal data from sending out direct marketing communications. Some of the below activities might not necessarily involve processing of personal data. However, we would like to be transparent about the processing activities we undertake (with data generally) and would like to give our users full control over marketing related processing of personal data, as explained here. All of the below activities do correspond with our legitimate interest of better understanding our customers, customer trends and expectations when providing or offering our Services. For example, marketing analytics may include:\n- General analysis of user behavior for better marketing strategies, decision or more personalized targeted advertising;\n- Targeted advertising of Sygic products or services for example via Facebook App Install ads, Google AdWords, PayPerClick and similar tools;\n- Performance analysis of different marketing campaigns (e.g. Exponea, Google Analytics);\n- Cross-device linking (pairing of data about different devices of the same user);\n- User segmentation for more personalized direct marketing communication (if conditions for direct marketing communications are met).\n\nStatistics\nWe keep various anonymous or aggregated statistics based on which one cannot identify an individual. For example, we might keep statistics about how many users are using our applications or what is the average usage time of our applications. Although these statistics are made by conversion or analysis of real personal data, the statistic findings or results are not personal data.\n\nMaintaining social media profiles\nWe maintain several business profiles on social media platforms where you can interact or communicate with us. By doing so, we are pursuing our legitimate interest: increasing company/brand awareness in online environment. We might process your personal data via our social media profiles when you write to us, comment, like or share our posts. Your provision of personal data via social media to us is voluntary. Please read relevant privacy policies to better understand processing of your personal data by providers of social media platforms. We only have a typical admin control over the personal data processed by us via our own company profiles. We assume that by using these social media platforms, you understand that your personal data might be processed for other purposes and that your personal data might by transferred to other third countries and third parties by providers of social media platforms. You can currently find us on Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Youtube, Stack Overflow, Github, Tumblr, Dribble and Behance.\n\nConsumer contests\nWe might organize customer contests, price giveaways or similar promotional activities for example via our social media profiles. When we do so, we typically put forwards terms \u0026 conditions or statute which you need to accept before joining the contest. By doing so, you conclude a contract with us meaning we do not need your consent for participation and related processing of your personal data. However, we would always ask your consent should the circumstances require so.\n\nBilling, Tax \u0026 Accounting\nWhen you purchase any paid add-on, feature or application from us, we must process your personal data in line with the applicable billing, tax and accounting legislation. Invoices and invoicing documentation might include your personal data. However, we are obliged to process, keep and store such data for statutory periods in order to be compliant with local law. Specific provisions of billing, tax and accounting legislation might vary across different jurisdictions.\n\nSecurity of personal data\nWe are obliged to adopt measures to ensure appropriate level of personal data security. Although these measures are not primarily directed for processing of personal data (which is rather a by-product of their purpose), processing of your personal data to some necessary extent might be needed in order for these measures to be implemented (for example encryption, pseudonymization, logging, backups, crash reporting, breach/incident reporting, security investigations and documentations, access control, harmful content detection, etc.).\n\nHandling user requests\nEvery time we are legally required to handle your requests, we must necessarily process your personal data. For example, when you approach us with request based on your data subject rights stemming from GDPR, we must process your personal data in order to comply with GDPR requirements.\n\nLegal enforcement\nFrom time to time, we might need to pursue a legal claim, ask for compensation or off-court settlement, keep evidence for potential dispute, manage legal contracts, request legal advice from external advisors, report illegal activity to law enforcement authorities or otherwise protect our legitimate legal interests (i.e. enforcing our legal rights). Although these activities do not automatically involve processing of personal data about our users (which happens very rarely), we would like to be transparent about such purpose of processing in case it does.\nBy virtue of this privacy policy, all of the above purposes are determined by us generally against all users of our Services from the moment of their collection despite the fact that the actual processing operation or purpose might not be relevant to every individual in every case. From this reason, we do not regard these as “other” purposes pursuant to Art. 6(4) of the GDPR which would require us to inform you about such purposes once they become relevant in future.\n\nHow do we collect your personal data?\n\nGenerally, we collect your personal data directly from you (source), for example when you decide to download our app, make a purchase, register your account, fill-out marketing consent form, contact us or otherwise use our Services. Provision of personal data to us by you might happen directly, for example by filling-out registration, order or consent form but might also happen indirectly for example by using our apps which need to collect data in order to operate and in order to provide you with the Services requested. For example, when using our navigation or localization apps, we must collect your precise location, speed and bearings. Provision of personal data by you is voluntary or presents either a requirement to enter into a contract or a contractual requirement (EULA). Certain processing of personal data might be required by law or required by us in order to pursue our own legitimate interests, as explained above. However, if you decide not to provide us your personal data in the first place, these additional statutory or legitimate interest provisions of data should not happen.\n\nWho are recipients of your personal data?\n\nWe take the confidentiality of your personal data very seriously and have policies in place to ensure that your data is only shared with authorized personnel of Sygic or a verified third party. Our employees might have access to your personal data on a strictly need-to-know basis typically governed and limited by function, role and department of the particular employee. We also use sub-contractors to support us in providing the Services who might process personal data for us. We ensure that selection of our sub-contractors and any processing of personal data by them is compliant with the GDPR. Categories of recipients of your personal data are:\n- Affiliated Sygic companies;\n- Hosting or cloud services providers;\n- Marketing and analytics software service providers;\n- Social media platform operators;\n- Authorized personnel of the above.\n- We share anonymous and aggregated data which is not linkable to an individual with our business partners. We make sure such data is not a personal data.\n\nWhat countries do we transfer your personal data to?\n\nBy default, we seek not to transfer your personal data outside the EU and/or European Economic Area where not necessary. However, some of our sub-contractors or the above-mentioned recipients of personal data might be based or their servers might be located in the United States of America (U.S.). As such, US is regarded a third party not ensuring adequate level of protection. However, companies certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield mechanism according to the EU Commision (Text of the Commission’s EU-US Privacy Shield Decision) are regarded as ensuring adequate level of protection. Any transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area is done by us only under strict compliance with the GDPR. We ensure the third-party recipients are either certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield, concluded EU model clauses with us or follow equivalent safeguards in place.\n\nHow long we store your personal data?\n\nWe must not and we do not want to store your personal data for longer than necessary for the given purpose of processing. Due to this legal requirement but also due to technical and financial aspects of data storage we actively delete data where no longer necessary. In general, storage periods of the following purposes are linked to active usage of our apps and the actual data on our product servers at the given time:\n- Provision of the Services\n- Development, improvement \u0026 testing\n- Marketing analytics\n- Statistics\n- Security of personal data\n\nThis means (in general) that if you stop using our app, we stop processing your personal data for the above purposes of processing. If you uninstall our app, we delete personal data collected by the app. However, depending on the circumstances we delete some data sooner or later than that, for example:\n- Data used for application improvement after 3 months\n- Security and system logs after 1 year\n- Back-ups for security purposes after 3 years\n\nSome of our users might have a life-time license for our apps. In that case, we must store credentials of the license holder for a period equivalent to “life-time” period which is 90 years from license purchase. If you request us to erase your personal data including your license credentials we can do so, but you will loose the life-time license as well (i.e. you will no longer be in the list of license holders). Please note that if you then decide to use our apps again in the future, you might not be able to rely on your license unless you prove to us that you had the license before. We therefore suggest you keep evidence of our communication about the license credentials erasure.\nAs regards the purpose of direct marketing communications (newsletter \u0026 push notifications), the storage period generally lasts until you revoke your consent (opt-out) or object against direct marketing.\nAs regards Billing, Tax \u0026 Accounting purposes the retention period are governed by local law and depending on the type of information or document in which billing personal data might be included the storage period is 10 years.\nIt stems from the nature of social media profiles that we do not actively delete the history of our profiles, but you are free do so or request us to do so at any time. We delete old private messages via social media once every 3 years.\nIn general, storage periods for consumer contests is the duration of the contest.\nAs regards handling user requests and legal enforcement, we might keep your personal data if we believe it might be necessary for us in court, criminal or administrative proceedings in the future. General limitation period under Slovak law is 3 years.\n\nWhat rights do you have?\n\nYou have right to object to any processing that is based on legitimate interest including to profiling based on such legitimate interest pursuant to the Article 21 GDPR.\nWe rely on legitimate interest for purposes of Development, improvement \u0026 testing, Marketing analytics, Maintaining social media profiles and Legal enforcement.\nYou also have a right to object to any direct marketing processing of your personal data including profiling.\nIf we process your personal data, you have so-called data subject rights under the Article 15 to 22 of the GDPR. Among others, you have right to request access to your personal data, rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing or right to object to processing as well as the right to data portability. However, these are not absolute rights and they only exist if the relevant conditions are met. For example, right for erasure does not apply in case when such personal data is required for compliance with legal obligation (Billing, Tax \u0026 Accounting) or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (Legal enforcement). Please contact us at privacy@sygic.com if you have a general query about your data subject rights.\nYou have a right to lodge a complaint related to personal data to the relevant data protection supervisory authority. Please note that our lead data protection authority is the Office for Protection of Personal Data of the Slovak Republic.\nIf you are not sure about whether we process your personal data, you can request our confirmation by reference to the right of access under the Art. 15(1) of the GDPR. If we do process your personal data you can request the following information:\n- the purposes of the processing;\n- the categories of personal data concerned;\n- the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organizations;\n- where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;\n- the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing;\n- the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;\n- where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;\n- the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.\nPlease note, that if you use our apps, most of the above information is already included in this privacy policy. You have also right to request copy of your personal data pursuant to the Art. 15(3) of the GDPR. You have right to request some of your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format provided that the conditions for data portability under Art. 20 of the GDPR are met. These conditions might be met where the legal basis for processing is your consent or performance of contract (provision of the Services, newsletters and consumer contest) where you provide the personal data to us.\nWhen we process your personal data based on your consent, you can always revoke your consent at any time. You can always use our general contact details for revoking consent or objecting to processing. In case of email newsletters, you will find opt-out button at the bottom of every direct marketing email.\nIf you feel that we are processing incorrect personal data about you given the purpose and circumstances and you cannot change such personal data via functionality of the app, account or website, you can request rectification of incorrect or incomplete personal data using the below supplementary statement (all information is voluntary) and/or our general contact details:\n\nSupplementary statement for rectification of personal data\nYour name and surname:\t\nAccount email:\t\nType of Sygic service used:\t (Please indicate what application, website or service your request relates to)\nNature of your rectification:\t(Please explain whether you would like to request correction of incorrect or completion of incomplete personal data)\nContext of your rectification request: (Please explain us why you believe we are processing incorrect or incomplete data)\nRectification:\t(Please express the correction or completion of the particular personal data you are requesting)\nThis supplementary statement for rectification can be send to Sygic at privacy@sygic.com\nWhen enforcing your data subject rights, please be as explicit and detailed as possible. Otherwise, we might respond with request to clarify a generic, vague or too general requests which in turn delays getting the information you request.\n\nCookies\n\nWhen processing your personal data, operating our websites or generally providing or supporting our Services we may use cookies and similar technologies. Specifically, we use these technologies for Direct marketing communications (newsletter \u0026 push notifications) and Marketing analytics. You have a control about the use of cookies via setting of your internet browser, where you can disable cookies at any time.\n\nChanges to this privacy policy\n\nWe may change this privacy policy from time to time by posting the most current privacy policy and its effective date on our website. In case we change this privacy policy substantially, we may bring such changes to your attention by explicit notice in our apps, on our websites or by email.","editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Discover new places"},"is32bitOnly":false,"isStandaloneWithCompanionForWatchOS":false,"seller":"Tripomatic s.r.o.","isSiriSupported":false,"languageList":["English","Arabic","Czech","Dutch","French","German","Greek","Hungarian","Italian","Korean","Polish","Portuguese","Romanian","Russian","Simplified Chinese","Slovak","Spanish","Swedish","Turkish"],"messagesScreenshots":{"ipadPro_2018":[{"width":2048,"height":2732,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/9f/c8/5b/9fc85ba8-9f89-e2e8-4152-32583b94c757/mzl.tbnyajcr.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f9f9f9","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"292929","textColor3":"313131","textColor4":"535353"},{"width":2048,"height":2732,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/a0/b0/db/a0b0db98-67e1-4c3e-895c-68e26bc1e18f/mzl.zpnbkxrq.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"1a1a1a","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"474747"},{"width":2048,"height":2732,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/67/f6/70/67f67041-1f4f-813c-d909-0d95bcd46fb3/mzl.bsvxyxio.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"312b27","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"5a5552"}],"iphone_6_5":[{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/29/7a/c8/297ac89e-4e43-eb91-45c9-736f0b547437/mzl.rojygmqs.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f9f9f9","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"31322d","textColor3":"313131","textColor4":"595a56"},{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/45/0a/47/450a476e-62a7-c285-aa5b-5cc4e293ff47/mzl.rklpwhvw.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"0f0704","textColor2":"121213","textColor3":"3f3836","textColor4":"424242"},{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/3b/4d/45/3b4d45ec-936f-8561-95e9-5d199662eabb/mzl.uaatmilq.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"313131","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"5a5a5a"}],"ipadPro":[{"width":2048,"height":2732,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/03/83/86/038386ce-b260-11b1-50f8-971e757ad876/mzl.xekfxgwt.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f9f9f9","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"292929","textColor3":"313131","textColor4":"535353"},{"width":2048,"height":2732,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/6b/05/6b/6b056bde-faaf-2878-d7e8-8f71a919ed20/mzl.djytgeld.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"1a1a1a","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"474747"},{"width":2048,"height":2732,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/8c/4d/46/8c4d468e-9914-d05f-7946-30482c76246d/mzl.wunywsli.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"312b27","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"5a5552"}],"iphone6+":[{"width":1242,"height":2208,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/27/8c/2e/278c2ead-262d-f638-8371-a20a451bc432/mzl.ydjcmrvn.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f9f9f9","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"2a2a2a","textColor3":"323232","textColor4":"535353"},{"width":1242,"height":2208,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/1a/63/1b/1a631bb1-416e-beae-f465-7b54216bb23b/mzl.zuvgvedt.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f3f3f3","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"2e2522","textColor3":"303030","textColor4":"564e4b"},{"width":1242,"height":2208,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/7e/ab/0b/7eab0b0a-5a2e-87f1-7126-ee565bd5dc90/mzl.thpcifvf.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f3f3f3","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"24201b","textColor3":"303030","textColor4":"4d4a46"}]},"description":{"standard":"Discover things to do anywhere you go.

I tried using Google Trips, Tripline, and any other app that was recommended for trip planning. Sygic is the only one I have tried which had all the options I needed. Some of the features I appreciate include: being able to select multiple types of transportation for each day. If I am trying to plan a route on google maps for a day it won’t let me switch between using a car and using public transportation. Sygic let’s me decide for each destination whether I want to drive, take public, transportation, etc. The app also estimates based on the activities and routes how long of a day it will be. I used to manually estimate how long I would spend at each place I wanted to visit based on googles average for how long people spend there. Sygic automatically has an estimate for each travel site already. Also those times can be adjusted if needed. \nThe premium feature of printing trips to PDF is also great. The PDF looks great and includes the travel guides for the cities you are visiting. \nOverall the app has everything I want from a trip planning app and I looking forward to continuing to use it for many more trips to come!","title":"Just what I’ve been looking for!","userName":"alpop12"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1802561743","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2017-09-21T22:53:23Z","developerResponse":{"id":1326913,"body":"Hello, thanks so much for the lovely review, you've just made our day :) We're thrilled to accompany you on your travels, hope that you will plan many more trips with us!

I cannot explain how invaluable this app has been to me thus far. I paid for the premium version and it was well worth it. I have had cell data turned off my entire trip but this app has helped me navigate the complicated streets of several cities despite having my data turned off (I don't know how- but it is not using data). It is amazing, i planned my entire month long trip using the app. When I had questions, I emailed the developers and received prompt responses.

Even share it. The biggest problem I have is being able to use my choice of navigation. I’d like to be able to use Google Maps or Apple maps for directions but it forces you to use their GPS solution, which then requires an additional purchase to get turn by turn directions!\n\nUpdate: User error. Sygic actually uses Apple’s way of doing their settings so it wasn’t apparent to the user. Support is correct and you can change the default navigation app. Home Screen/Springboard \u003e Settings \u003e Sygic Travel. Amazing. The only issue I have is the app should walk you through an initial setup to get these things sorted out. With this fixed definitely an app I could recommend to others.

I'm sorry to hear you encountered some problems with time zones. We have already identified the issue and will fix it in the next release of the app. In the meantime, restarting the app should fix the problem. As for adding an item on multiple days with different time settings, unfortunately, it is not possible yet. However we hope to make this possible in the new version of our app which we're currently beta testing. For the time being, you can use custom places to denote you are visiting the place for a second time. Click/tap anywhere in the map to create one - you can edit its detail later. Regarding the search issues, could you please contact our support staff at team@travel.sygic.com with the details of the places you were not able to find? We will look into this further. I'm glad to hear you also discovered some good points of the app :) Tereza / Sygic Travel","modified":"2017-12-21T13:32:38Z"},"rating":2,"review":"I really want to like this app but I find that I can’t trust it with my trip plans.  After landing in the UK from the USA, this app moved all my events one day ahead.  Maybe this is a time-zone issue but a world travel app should handle things better.  After moving them all back manually, the map filtering still filters based on the wrong dates so my itinerary view is not in sync with the map view.  My trip companion who is sharing my data on her iPad still sees the dates wrongly also even after I’ve manually corrected them on my iPad.\n\nAnother thing that is quite terrible is that there doesn’t appear to be a way to put the same item in the trip on multiple days with different time settings.  For example, if you want to put the airport in for your arrival and departure, editing the time will change it on both days.\n\nThe searching seems quite bad also.  Many times the app can’t find what I am looking for, but if I zoom in on the map, suddenly the item is there and I can click on it to add to the trip.\n\nOn the positive side, the app has neat workflow, allowing itineraries to be built up with nice visualization on the map.  It also makes it easy to discover nearby items of interest.\n\nIf this app could be bullet-proof in handling trip data, this would be an amazing app and would be a big part of my tip planning.  As it is, I don’t feel that I can trust it.","title":"Good app concept, but untrustworthy","userName":"MechEngineer"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2988658922","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-07-29T20:23:56Z","developerResponse":{"id":4457216,"body":"Hello, thanks for the review and the feedback, we really appreciate it.

Google Trips was pretty good for finding info, but I couldn't share or get maps.  I like Sygic's map feature with the little pictures to click on (but some pictures don't match the place). I'm able to share my trip with family, and that is great.  I also like the mode of transportation option.\nHowever, if you are looking for a specific place and don't have the EXACT name that Sygic has it listed, it's difficult to find.  I wish it was linked to a search engine that could help decider what I meant.\n For instance, I could not find Hotel Moderno on the Puerta del Sol in Madrid even when I put in street address. (Lots of others popped up from different places). I finally found it when I clicked on \"accommodations\" and it was listed as just \"Moderno\" \nOr looking for the Ratoncito Perez museum, I looked up Ratoncito Perez, but couldn't find it until I put the official name Casa Museo del Ratón Pérez.  \nI paid the fee for premium, but the info isn't stellar, just ok. So I'm not getting rid of my Google Trips app just yet. \nI still think the sale price for the app was worth it, I do like the map and sharing feature.","title":"Best I've found, but not great.","userName":"Jgdsfnyy"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2591010589","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-05-24T19:27:12Z","developerResponse":{"id":3595475,"body":"Hi, thanks for the message, we're really sorry to hear that you are not happy with the app. What exactly don't you like or what could we change about the app?
