        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So I use this app on my iPad and my Apple TV (4th gen). This review addresses both devices.<br /><br />On my Apple TV you cannot pause/resume while watching &quot;live&quot;. This is the same on my iPad.<br /><br />If, while watching in &quot;live&quot; mode I choose to &quot;restart&quot;, I can pause/resume using iPad, but NOT in Apple TV. With either device while doing a restart of a live show I cannot scrub forward to the current live position of the show. This is VERY annoying! If I&#39;m wanting to restart a live show and then scrub (fast forward) to somewhere in between the start position and the current &quot;live&quot; position I can&#39;t. I should be able to!<br /><br />If I stream something previously recorded I can pause/resume a show on both devices. I can scrub forward/backward on my iPad but NOT on my Apple TV. Of course, scrubbing is deactivated during commercial breaks, which is normal for most streaming TV apps.<br /><br />The menu is thoughtfully designed and easy to navigate. It&#39;s a better menu implementation then DirecTV NOW, or Sony Playstation VUE, both of which I use on my Apple TV and iPad.<br /><br />If it weren&#39;t for the issues mentioned above (inconsistency between devices, pause/resume and scrub niggles) I would have given this app 5 stars. As it is, I gave it 4 stars on iPad and 3 stars on Apple TV.</p>

I can only watch 20-25 min of the show with out issues and then it’s every few minutes that it will freeze and then right near the end, it does it every few seconds. Not to mention with the commercials, they freeze as well, and when I get to the end where I want to read the clue at the bottoms of the screen or go back cuz I missed something, you can’t, because it’ll only show the play/pause button and “ad” written inside a circle. This app has so many issues and reading the reviews it seems like they’ve been around for quite awhile. Someone needs fix these issues. This is why I deleted the app before nearly a year or so ago, but forgot when I decided to binge this show, which I can’t find anywhere else. It’s ridiculous. I shouldn’t have to reboot my Xbox every 30 minutes to watch a 40 minute show.</p>

    Frustrating, slow, unresponsive, bad for commuters

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is one of the most frustrating apps I’ve used in a long time. I am a DC metro commuter so I travel from cell tower to cell tower as well as underground. This app absolutely struggles with trying to keep up. Key features like preloading or the ability to download an episode are missing. The AMC app gives that ability which is great for planning for your travel. The app has a terrible time remembering where you left off, a lot of times requiring me to restart an episode, which of course queues commercials. Speaking of commercials, if you lose connectivity for a second the app quits out of the show and requires you to find the show again and restart, which again requires watching the 5 commercials. When going through tunnels on a subway this can be a nightmare. I had this happen 4 times in a row one time. Sometimes even when I have 4 bars of LTE the show will still hang up and do the loading circle. Nothing quite compares to the Netflix or HBO apps. This has taken me way too long to get through the horrible show that is The Passage.</p>

SCOPE AND APPLICATION:  What and who this Policy covers\n2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION:  The sources of and methods by which we, our service providers, and our advertisers collect information from and about you, including information about your interaction with the FOX Services \n3. USE AND DISCLOSURE:  How we use the information we collect from and about you, and who we might share it with and why\n4. SECURITY:  How we protect your information from loss or misuse\n5.

CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT NOTICE:  Other things you should know if you reside in California\n\n1. SCOPE AND APPLICATION\n\nFox Broadcasting Company, LLC (“FOX” or “we”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you.  This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications (“apps”), and widgets (collectively, the “FOX Services”).  California residents, please see the California Consumer Privacy Act Notice in Section 8 below.  By using FOX Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  A list of our affiliated companies (“FOX Affiliates”) is available at www.foxcorporation.com.\n\nAs set forth in our Terms of Use, the FOX Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. \n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the FOX Services without being registered with or subscribing to a FOX Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to a FOX Service.  This Privacy Policy applies to FOX’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address).  It also describes generally FOX’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).  \n\n2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION \n\t\t\nFOX and our service providers may collect the following information from and about you:  \n\nRegistration Information is the information you submit to register for a FOX Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes.  Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code and birthday.  \n\nPublic Information and Posts consist of comments or content that you post to the FOX Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture.  Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.   \n\nInformation from Social Media.  If you access or log-in to a FOX Service through a social media service or connect a FOX Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service.  When you access the FOX Services through social media services or when you connect a FOX Service to social media services, you are authorizing FOX to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\t\n\nAuthenticated Content Access. To access certain video content via the FOX Services, you will be redirected to your television content provider’s registration page where you will be required to sign in using your television content provider account. Please contact your television content provider directly with questions concerning your account, including how to access, update and manage your personal account information.\n\nActivity Information.  When you access and interact with the FOX Services, FOX and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to the FOX Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the FOX Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device.  \n\nCookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, local storage, and other mechanisms) use various approaches to collect and store data. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device.  Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address).. FOX’s websites, apps and other services use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service.  These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the FOX Services, such as pages you have visited, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed. \n\nOther parties that support the FOX Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate FOX Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the FOX Services or other parties’ services.  Those parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer.  FOX does not control these technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of parties using such technologies.  For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled “To deliver relevant advertisements,” below.  \n\nYour browser may be initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, and to block cookies altogether.  Please consult the \"Help\" section of your browser for more information, including on how to clear data from local storage and, depending on your browser, how to turn off other data collection by the browser.  To opt out of Google Analytics specifically, go to https https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.  Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the FOX Services.\n\nThe FOX Services that enable you to view FOX video content may feature Nielsen’s proprietary measurement software which will allow you to contribute to market research, like Nielsen’s TV Ratings. The information is collected directly by Nielsen’s software within the applicable FOX Service. FOX makes no representation or warranty to you regarding the Nielsen software. To learn more about Nielsen’s digital measurement products and your choices in regard to them, including how to opt out, please visit https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/legal/privacy-statement/digital-measurement/ .  \n\nInformation from Other Sources.  We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information about your online and offline activity from social media services, advertising technology companies, advertisers, commercially available sources, and information from our FOX Affiliates or business partners.  \n\nDo Not Track Signals.  At this time we do not respond to browser 'Do Not Track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.\n\n3. USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe may use the information we collect from and about you to provide the FOX Services and features to you, including: to measure and improve those FOX Services and features and to develop new products and services; to improve your experience with both online and off-line FOX Services by delivering content you will find relevant and interesting, including advertising and marketing messages; to allow you to comment on content, and participate in online games, contests, other promotions, or rewards programs; to provide you with customer support and to respond to inquiries.  In order to provide you with content and advertising that is more interesting and relevant to you, we may use the information from and about you to make inferences and predictions about your potential areas of interest.  When the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person, we may use that information for any purpose or share it with other parties, to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\nWe use the information we collect from and about you for these additional purposes:\n\nTo allow service providers to assist us in providing and managing the FOX Services.  The information we collect from and about you may be made available to certain service providers, such as contractors, analytics and other measurement companies, agents or sponsors, who help us analyze and understand your use of the FOX Services, and manage and/or provide the FOX Services.   \n\nTo deliver video content. In the ordinary course of our business, we may share information that we collect from or about you with other parties in order to process your requests and fulfill your orders for video content offered through the FOX Services, including, to provide you with access to localized content and provide video content recommendations. For example, to process your request to view certain authenticated video content through the FOX Services, we may share information about you, including, without limitation, what you have viewed, with your designated television content provider and/or our service providers in order to authenticate and/or authorize you to view authenticated video content through the FOX Services.\n\nTo allow social sharing functionality.  If you log in with or connect a social media service account with FOX Services, we may share your user name, picture, and likes, as well as your activities and comments with other FOX Services users and with your friends associated with your social media service.  We may also share the same information with the social media service provider.  By logging in with or connecting your FOX Services account with a social media service, you are authorizing us to share information we collect from and about you with the social media service provider, other users and your friends and you understand that the social media service’s use of the shared information will be governed by the social media service’s privacy policy.  If you do not want your personal information shared in this way, please do not connect your social media service account with your FOX Services account and do not participate in social sharing on FOX Services.\n\nTo provide co-branded services and features.  We may offer co-branded services or features, such as contests, sweepstakes or other promotions together with other companies (“Co-Branded Services”).  These Co-Branded Services may be hosted on FOX Services or on that other party’s service.  By virtue of these relationships, we may share the information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with that party.  That other party’s use of your information will be governed by its privacy policy. \n\nTo deliver relevant advertisements.  FOX and our service providers may use the information we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy to deliver relevant ads to you when you use the FOX Services or another service (on any of your devices).  As noted above advertising technology companies and advertisers may use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track information such as demographic information, inferred interests, aggregated information, and information about the different devices and/or browsers you use and your activity on such devices and browsers, to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests.  To find out more about advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see https://youradchoices.com/.  If you wish to opt out of tailored advertising in desktop and mobile browsers, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ or http://optout.networkadvertising.org/# on each of your devices and browsers.  To opt out in mobile apps, you may use your device’s setting to opt out of ads personalization or similar settings or download and use the AppChoices app at http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.  To opt out on connected TVs, please use the  device’s setting to opt out of ads personalization  “Interest-based Ads,” or equivalent settings on your device.  Please note that opting-out does not mean that you will stop seeing all ads.  \n\nTo contact you.  FOX may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related to the FOX Services.  If you want to stop receiving promotional materials from a FOX Service, follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.  There are certain service notification and other non-promotional emails that you may not opt-out of, such as notifications of changes to the FOX Services or policies.  If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can change the settings either on your mobile device or through the app.\n\nTo share with our FOX Affiliates.  FOX may share your information with FOX Affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  A link to a website that lists FOX Affiliates can be found at the beginning of this policy.  Users who visit FOX Affiliates’ services should still refer to their separate privacy policies, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy. \n\nTo share with business partners.  FOX may share your information with business partners to permit them to send you marketing communications consistent with your choices.  \n\nTo protect the rights of FOX and others.  There may be instances when FOX may use or disclose your information, including situations where FOX has a good faith belief that such use or disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of FOX, our FOX Affiliates, or our or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our terms of use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the FOX Services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.  \n\nTo complete a merger or sale of assets.  If FOX sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business (including in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceedings), FOX may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.\n\n4. SECURITY\n\nFOX uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures designed to safeguard information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification.  However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information.  \n\n5. USER ACCESS AND CONTROL\n\nIf you would like to access personal information we hold about you, or delete personal information you have previously provided directly to FOX, please visit https://fcprivacy.exterro.net/portal/dsar.htm?target=Fox_Entertainment and submit a request. \n\nPlease note that, for security reasons, we will ask you to verify your identity in order to proceed with your request.  If you would like to review, correct, update, suppress, or otherwise limit our use of your personal information, you may contact us using the mechanisms provided below. In your request, please include your email address, name, address, and telephone number and specify clearly what information you would like to change, update, suppress, or delete or if you have other questions about your personal information. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and consistent with applicable law.\n\nIf you are a resident of California, please see the section entitled “California Consumer Privacy Act Notice,” below, for more information about the rights you have under California law.\n\nIf you are an eligible registered user of a FOX Service and under 18, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to that FOX Service by visiting  https://help.fox.com/s/support-form, and submitting a ticket with “Privacy \u0026 Security” as the topic that best describes your issue. Please provide your email address in the designated space and your full name and specific FOX Service you have signed up for in the “Description” field. We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, as, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another user.\n\nIf you are a California resident, you may request that we not share your personal information on a going-forward basis with FOX Affiliates or unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes by visiting https://help.fox.com/s/support-form, and submitting a ticket with “Privacy \u0026 Security” as the topic that best describes your issue. Please provide your email address in the designated space and your full name and specific FOX Service you have signed up for in the “Description” field. We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. \n\n6. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION\n\nUpdates to Privacy Policy.  FOX may modify this Privacy Policy.  Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised.  Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the FOX Services.  \n\nLocation of Data.  The FOX Services are hosted in and managed from the United States.  If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States or in any other country in which we have facilities or in which we engage service providers.  United States and other countries’ data protection laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction.   \n\nLinked Services.  The FOX Services may be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies.  FOX is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies, and once you leave the FOX Services or click an advertisement you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service.    \n\nIn addition, FOX is not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Apple, Google, Microsoft or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including in connection with any information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the FOX Services.\n\nCollection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service. In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (“Payment Service”).  If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage.  Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.

CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT NOTICE:  Other things you should know if you reside in California\n\n1. SCOPE AND APPLICATION\n\nFox Broadcasting Company, LLC (“FOX” or “we”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you.  This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications (“apps”), and widgets (collectively, the “FOX Services”).  California residents, please see the California Consumer Privacy Act Notice in Section 8 below.  By using FOX Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  A list of our affiliated companies (“FOX Affiliates”) is available at www.foxcorporation.com.\n\nAs set forth in our Terms of Use, the FOX Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. \n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the FOX Services without being registered with or subscribing to a FOX Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to a FOX Service.  This Privacy Policy applies to FOX’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address).  It also describes generally FOX’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage).  \n\n2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION \n\t\t\nFOX and our service providers may collect the following information from and about you:  \n\nRegistration Information is the information you submit to register for a FOX Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes.  Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code and birthday.  \n\nPublic Information and Posts consist of comments or content that you post to the FOX Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture.  Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.   \n\nInformation from Social Media.  If you access or log-in to a FOX Service through a social media service or connect a FOX Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service.  When you access the FOX Services through social media services or when you connect a FOX Service to social media services, you are authorizing FOX to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\t\n\nAuthenticated Content Access. To access certain video content via the FOX Services, you will be redirected to your television content provider’s registration page where you will be required to sign in using your television content provider account. Please contact your television content provider directly with questions concerning your account, including how to access, update and manage your personal account information.\n\nActivity Information.  When you access and interact with the FOX Services, FOX and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to the FOX Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the FOX Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device.  \n\nCookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, local storage, and other mechanisms) use various approaches to collect and store data. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device.  Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address).. FOX’s websites, apps and other services use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service.  These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the FOX Services, such as pages you have visited, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed. \n\nOther parties that support the FOX Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate FOX Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the FOX Services or other parties’ services.  Those parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer.  FOX does not control these technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of parties using such technologies.  For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled “To deliver relevant advertisements,” below.  \n\nYour browser may be initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, and to block cookies altogether.  Please consult the \"Help\" section of your browser for more information, including on how to clear data from local storage and, depending on your browser, how to turn off other data collection by the browser.  To opt out of Google Analytics specifically, go to https https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.  Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the FOX Services.\n\nThe FOX Services that enable you to view FOX video content may feature Nielsen’s proprietary measurement software which will allow you to contribute to market research, like Nielsen’s TV Ratings. The information is collected directly by Nielsen’s software within the applicable FOX Service. FOX makes no representation or warranty to you regarding the Nielsen software. To learn more about Nielsen’s digital measurement products and your choices in regard to them, including how to opt out, please visit https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/legal/privacy-statement/digital-measurement/ .  \n\nInformation from Other Sources.  We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information about your online and offline activity from social media services, advertising technology companies, advertisers, commercially available sources, and information from our FOX Affiliates or business partners.  \n\nDo Not Track Signals.  At this time we do not respond to browser 'Do Not Track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.\n\n3. USE AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe may use the information we collect from and about you to provide the FOX Services and features to you, including: to measure and improve those FOX Services and features and to develop new products and services; to improve your experience with both online and off-line FOX Services by delivering content you will find relevant and interesting, including advertising and marketing messages; to allow you to comment on content, and participate in online games, contests, other promotions, or rewards programs; to provide you with customer support and to respond to inquiries.  In order to provide you with content and advertising that is more interesting and relevant to you, we may use the information from and about you to make inferences and predictions about your potential areas of interest.  When the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person, we may use that information for any purpose or share it with other parties, to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\nWe use the information we collect from and about you for these additional purposes:\n\nTo allow service providers to assist us in providing and managing the FOX Services.  The information we collect from and about you may be made available to certain service providers, such as contractors, analytics and other measurement companies, agents or sponsors, who help us analyze and understand your use of the FOX Services, and manage and/or provide the FOX Services.   \n\nTo deliver video content. In the ordinary course of our business, we may share information that we collect from or about you with other parties in order to process your requests and fulfill your orders for video content offered through the FOX Services, including, to provide you with access to localized content and provide video content recommendations. For example, to process your request to view certain authenticated video content through the FOX Services, we may share information about you, including, without limitation, what you have viewed, with your designated television content provider and/or our service providers in order to authenticate and/or authorize you to view authenticated video content through the FOX Services.\n\nTo allow social sharing functionality.  If you log in with or connect a social media service account with FOX Services, we may share your user name, picture, and likes, as well as your activities and comments with other FOX Services users and with your friends associated with your social media service.  We may also share the same information with the social media service provider.  By logging in with or connecting your FOX Services account with a social media service, you are authorizing us to share information we collect from and about you with the social media service provider, other users and your friends and you understand that the social media service’s use of the shared information will be governed by the social media service’s privacy policy.  If you do not want your personal information shared in this way, please do not connect your social media service account with your FOX Services account and do not participate in social sharing on FOX Services.\n\nTo provide co-branded services and features.  We may offer co-branded services or features, such as contests, sweepstakes or other promotions together with other companies (“Co-Branded Services”).  These Co-Branded Services may be hosted on FOX Services or on that other party’s service.  By virtue of these relationships, we may share the information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with that party.  That other party’s use of your information will be governed by its privacy policy. \n\nTo deliver relevant advertisements.  FOX and our service providers may use the information we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy to deliver relevant ads to you when you use the FOX Services or another service (on any of your devices).  As noted above advertising technology companies and advertisers may use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track information such as demographic information, inferred interests, aggregated information, and information about the different devices and/or browsers you use and your activity on such devices and browsers, to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests.  To find out more about advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see https://youradchoices.com/.  If you wish to opt out of tailored advertising in desktop and mobile browsers, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ or http://optout.networkadvertising.org/# on each of your devices and browsers.  To opt out in mobile apps, you may use your device’s setting to opt out of ads personalization or similar settings or download and use the AppChoices app at http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.  To opt out on connected TVs, please use the  device’s setting to opt out of ads personalization  “Interest-based Ads,” or equivalent settings on your device.  Please note that opting-out does not mean that you will stop seeing all ads.  \n\nTo contact you.  FOX may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related to the FOX Services.  If you want to stop receiving promotional materials from a FOX Service, follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.  There are certain service notification and other non-promotional emails that you may not opt-out of, such as notifications of changes to the FOX Services or policies.  If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can change the settings either on your mobile device or through the app.\n\nTo share with our FOX Affiliates.

I am a DC metro commuter so I travel from cell tower to cell tower as well as underground. This app absolutely struggles with trying to keep up. Key features like preloading or the ability to download an episode are missing. The AMC app gives that ability which is great for planning for your travel. The app has a terrible time remembering where you left off, a lot of times requiring me to restart an episode, which of course queues commercials. Speaking of commercials, if you lose connectivity for a second the app quits out of the show and requires you to find the show again and restart, which again requires watching the 5 commercials. When going through tunnels on a subway this can be a nightmare. I had this happen 4 times in a row one time. Sometimes even when I have 4 bars of LTE the show will still hang up and do the loading circle. Nothing quite compares to the Netflix or HBO apps.

I asked both to talk to each other with me on the phone to help resolve this issue but no one would. \n\nI notice all the recent reviews are really negative and the developer says the same thing to each user, to use chat to contact for help.

The Fox app is the only app that constantly allows me to watch and then randomly started telling me my provider package didn’t include Fox which I know is a lie because I watch it at home all the time when games are on and I’m home. This happened during the Michigan Army game in the 4th quarter after I had been watching it all game long. I ended up missing the end of the 4th and the OTs and I’ve never been able to log in since. Every time I try to log-in it says I’ve exceeded the maximum attempts and to try again in 15 minutes. I try once per day and still get this message when I know I’m putting the correct info in. My favorite team USC plays Washington on Saturday and I’m upset to see it’s on Fox because I will not be able to watch it on Saturday due to the app being awful.

It requires location services once to get live TV functionality otherwise it nags you to turn it on even though I never plan to use it. It constantly forgets my TV provider, and I have to constantly log into it every time I start it. It takes minutes just to get back to the shows I want to see. It takes too long to discover new shows. It really wants to get in your face with interactive ads even when I’m already paying for this stuff. It makes me feel like the product instead of a customer.
