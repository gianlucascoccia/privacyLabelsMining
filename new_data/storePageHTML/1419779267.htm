        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been struggling for some time now with guilt of a prior divorce after 20 years of marriage, BIG change since being married for a second time, becoming a step-parent to 4 boys (starting again after my own 5 children were nearly grown), moving to another town where I knew no-one, no friends and no WOMEN!   After spending several years in “the pit”, I was ready to move out!  I started diving into God’s Word more deeply a couple years ago now and God is doing a work in this stubborn and selfish heart of mine.  I started a small texting group sharing God’s truths, my own experiences, faith, failures and triumphs.  I am volunteering with an incredible youth ministry in my town and have been slowly rebuilding my life and my relationships with my family and my God.  Something was still missing.  Women.  I just started a subscription with Fox Nation and have been listening to Shanon Bream and Ainsley’s Bible Studies and feel such a breath of fresh air with these two wonderful women!  And although I cannot be there in-person with them, it is very sweet to listen to God’s truth and to be encouraged once again by women who love the Lord!  Thank you FOX and ALL of those on Fox Nation bringing truth, wisdom and Godly values to a very public audience.  May God bless and protect you all!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>When we look at our past and strive for a fair  honorable future we look to story tellers who attempt to show the good, bad and the ugly struggle we face to retain the success of a democratic republic that proves FREEDOM is the one ideal that’s built our solid foundation for our country. <br />Fox Nation gives us the information in between the day to day news that’s needed to remind us what’s happening in much more detail than the old term “Soundbites” used to generate! <br />Many journalists have become propagandist and we struggle to find the truth anymore. What’s been refreshing about watching Fox Nation is getting details that explain each story from a perspective that allows the viewer to know where the journalist is coming from before you are pushed into an opinion. I like being informed, not fed an agenda! <br />Watching the news from the old fashion method, gathering facts and sharing them with the viewer to allow them the perspective of the the facts, not the networks agenda driven narrative! <br />I hope you’ll love gaining new knowledge without the twisted bias! I know I do enjoy watching real news rather than being fed emotional dribble!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Fox Nation is a great streaming service that offers a large amount of unbiased factually supported programs that will open your eyes. They focus on giving the viewers the facts and truth and also encourage the viewers to not just take their word for it but go check out the sources and do your own research to form your views and opinions. The many host show the viewers it’s ok to stand up for the truth and facts and they help viewers to learn they can’t just blindly watch main stream media or programs and just believe your getting the truth(even tho that’s exactly what should happen) the news and networks are businesses and they have to make profits so most have sold their services to the govt to manufacture and shape the country the easiest way the government can take control. Fox Nation and the many host and commentators on their programs are some of the last true beacons of hope this country has at getting the facts and truth and the Fox Nation comes thru and gives the viewers just that the unbiased facts and truth and they let you decide how you think, feel and expect.</p>

SCOPE AND APPLICATION\r\n\nFox News Network, LLC (“Fox” or “we” or “our”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes the collection, use, and sharing of information from or about you in connection with your use of the Fox Nation Services. California residents, please see the California Consumer Privacy Act Notice in Section 8 below.  By using the Fox Nation Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  A list of our affiliated companies (“Fox Affiliates”) is available at https://www.foxcorporation.com/.\r\n\nThe term “Fox Nation Services” or “Services” refers to our video service, including the selection of television shows, clips, and other content we may offer (collectively, the “Content”) and our video player for viewing the Content (the “Video Player”), as well as any other Fox Nation product, feature, tool, material, or other service offered from time to time by Fox through a variety of Access Points. The term “Access Points” refers to, collectively, the Fox Nation website located at https://nation.foxnews.com, mobile applications, streaming channels and apps, and other places where any Fox Nation Services are authorized by Fox to be made available. As set forth in our Terms of Use, the Fox Nation Services are for a general audience, are not directed to children, and Fox does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16 years of age on or through the Fox Nation Services.\r\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Fox Nation Services, including both those who use the Fox Nation Services without being registered for the Fox Nation Services and those who have registered. This Privacy Policy applies to Fox’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address).  It also describes generally Fox’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage). \r\n\n2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION\r\n\nFox and our service providers may collect the following information from and about you:\r\n\nRegistration Information is the information you submit to register for the Fox Nation Services, for example, to create a Fox Nation account, post comments, receive a newsletter or mobile alert, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code, birthday, phone number, political view, and household income. In addition, Fox may collect information you provide to us when you respond to surveys, set your preferences, contact Fox through customer service or by other means, or participate in promotions that Fox may offer from time to time. Fox may allow for multiple profiles to be set up under one account. If this occurs, we may collect information you provide to us if you create a profile.\r\n\nPublic Information and Posts consist of comments or content that you post to the Fox Nation Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture.  Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.   \r\n\nInformation from Social Media.  If you access or log-in to the Fox Nation Services through a social media service or connect a Fox Nation Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service.  When you access the Fox Nation Services through social media services or when you connect a Fox Nation Service to social media services, you are authorizing Fox to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\t\r\n\nActivity Information.  When you access and interact with the Fox Nation Services, Fox and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to the Fox Nation Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the Fox Nation Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device.  \r\n\nCookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, local storage, and other mechanisms) use various approaches to collect and store data. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address).  Fox’s websites, apps and other services use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Fox Nation Services, such as pages you have visited, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed.\r\n\nOther parties that support the Fox Nation Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Fox Nation Service usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Fox Nation Services or other parties’ services (such as website and emails). Those parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. Fox does not control these technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of parties using such technologies. For more information about third party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled “To deliver relevant advertisements,” below.\r\n\nYour browser may be initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, and to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information, including on how to clear data from local storage, and depending on your browser, how to turn off other data collection by the browser.   Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the Fox Nation Services. \r\n\nInformation from Other Sources. We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information about your online and offline activity from social media services, advertising technology companies, advertisers, commercially available sources, and information from our Fox Affiliates or business partners. \r\n\nAuthenticated Content. To access certain Content via the Fox Nation Services, you may be redirected to your television content provider’s registration page, and/or you may be required to register directly with your television content provider. Any information that you provide to your television content provider will be subject to the applicable television content provider’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, your television content provider’s use of personal information.\r\n\nDo Not Track Signals.  At this time we do not respond to browser 'Do Not Track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.\r\n\n3. USE AND DISCLOSURE\r\n\nWe may use the information we collect from and about you to provide the Fox Nation Services and features to you, including to measure and improve those Fox Nation Services and features and to develop new products and services; to improve your experience with both online and off-line Fox Nation Services by delivering content you will find relevant and interesting, including advertising and marketing messages; to allow you to comment on content, and participate in online games, contests, other promotions, special offers, or rewards programs; to provide you with customer support and to respond to inquiries. In order to provide you with content and advertising that is more interesting and relevant to you, we may use the information from and about you to make inferences and predictions about your potential areas of interest. When the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person, we may use that  information for any purpose or share it with other parties, to the extent permitted by applicable law.\r\n\nWe use the information we collect from and about you for these additional purposes:\r\n\nTo allow service providers to assist us in providing and managing the Fox Nation Services. The information we collect from and about you may be made available to certain service providers, such as contractors, analytics and other measurement companies, agents or sponsors, who help us analyze and understand your use of the Fox Nation Services, and manage and/or provide the Fox Nation Services.\r\n\nTo deliver video content. In the ordinary course of our business, we may share information that we collect from or about you to third parties in order to process your requests and fulfill your orders for video content offered through the Fox Nation Services, including to provide you with access to localized content and provide video content recommendations.  For example, to process your request to view certain authenticated video content through the Fox Nation Services, we may need to share information about you with your designated television content provider and/or our third party service providers in order to authenticate and/or authorize you to view authenticated video content through the Fox Nation Services.\r\n\nTo allow social sharing functionality. If you log in with or connect a social media service account to the Fox Nation Services, we may share your user name, picture, and likes, as well as your activities and comments with other Fox Nation Services’ users and with your friends associated with your social media service. We may also share the same information with the social media service provider.  By logging in with or connecting your Fox Nation Services account with a social media service, you are authorizing us to share information we collect from and about you with the social media service provider, other users, and your friends and you understand that the social media service’s use of the shared information will be governed by the social media service’s privacy policy. If you do not want your personal information shared in this way, please do not connect your social media service account with your Fox Nation Services account and do not participate in social sharing on the Fox Nation Services.\r\n\nTo provide co-branded services and features. We may offer co-branded services or features, such as contests, sweepstakes, special offers, or other promotions together with companies (“Co-Branded Services”). These Co-Branded Services may be hosted on the Fox Nation Services or on that other party’s service. By virtue of these relationships, we may share the information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with that party. The other party’s use of your information will be governed by its privacy policy.\r\n\nTo deliver relevant advertisements. Fox Nation Services and our service providers may use the information we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy to deliver relevant ads to you when you use the Fox Nation Services (on any of your devices). To find out more about advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see https://youradchoices.com/. If you wish to opt out of tailored advertising in desktop and mobile browsers, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ or http://optout.networkadvertising.org/# on each of your devices and browsers. To opt out in mobile apps, you may use your device’s setting to opt out of ads personalization or similar settings or download and use the AppChoices app at  https://youradchoices.com/appchoices.

If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can change the settings either on your mobile device or through the app.\r\n\nTo share with our Affiliates. Fox may share your information with Fox Affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. A link to a website that lists Fox Affiliates can be found at the beginning of this policy. Users who visit Fox Affiliates’ services should still refer to their separate privacy policies, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy. \r\n\nTo share with business partners. Fox may share your information with business partners to permit them to send you marketing communications, consistent with your choices.\r\n\nTo protect the rights of Fox and others. There may be instances when Fox may use or disclose your information, including situations where Fox has a good faith belief that such use or disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of Fox, our Fox Affiliates or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our Terms of Use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the Fox Nation Services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.\r\n\nTo complete a merger or sale of assets. If Fox sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business (including in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceedings), Fox may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.\r\n\nOther Uses. We may also use the information we collect for any other uses in accordance with our Terms of Use and any other purpose that is disclosed to you at the time we collect the information or that is related to a request made by you.\r\n\n4. SECURITY \r\n\nFox uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures designed to safeguard information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification.

OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION \n\r\nUpdates to Privacy Policy.  Fox may modify this Privacy Policy.  Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised.  Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Fox Nation Services.  \r\n\nLocation of Data.  The Fox Nation Services are hosted in and managed from the United States.  If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States or in any other country in which we have facilities or in which we engage service providers.  United States and other countries’ data protection laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in the United States may be entitled to access your personal information.  \r\n\nLinked Services.  The Fox Nation Services may be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies.  Fox is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies, and once you leave the Fox Nation Services or click an advertisement you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service.    \r\n\nIn addition, Fox is not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Apple, Google, Microsoft or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including in connection with any information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Fox Nation Services.\r\n\nCollection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service \u0026 Use of Payment Information.  Fox may use a payment service to allow you to make payments (“Payment Service”). If you wish to make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to the Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.\r\n\nWe and/or Payment Service provider(s) may use payment information to help provide the Fox Nation Services.  For example, payment information may be used to retrieve account information for a subscriber, to determine whether a subscriber is eligible for promotions, and to detect abuse of the Fox Nation Services. In addition, for your convenience, we or our Payment Service provider(s) may enable your payment information to be accessible through Fox Affiliate websites or services in order to process your transaction with any such Fox Affiliate. If you visit or otherwise use an Fox Affiliate website or service, refer to such Fox Affiliate’s privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.\r\n\nData Retention. We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law. \r\n\nRemember that even after you cancel your account, or if you ask us to delete your personal information, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation or your request for deletion, for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or recordkeeping policies. It may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints or contractual, financial or legal requirements.\r\n\n7.

SCOPE AND APPLICATION\r\n\nFox News Network, LLC (“Fox” or “we” or “our”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes the collection, use, and sharing of information from or about you in connection with your use of the Fox Nation Services. California residents, please see the California Consumer Privacy Act Notice in Section 8 below.  By using the Fox Nation Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  A list of our affiliated companies (“Fox Affiliates”) is available at https://www.foxcorporation.com/.\r\n\nThe term “Fox Nation Services” or “Services” refers to our video service, including the selection of television shows, clips, and other content we may offer (collectively, the “Content”) and our video player for viewing the Content (the “Video Player”), as well as any other Fox Nation product, feature, tool, material, or other service offered from time to time by Fox through a variety of Access Points. The term “Access Points” refers to, collectively, the Fox Nation website located at https://nation.foxnews.com, mobile applications, streaming channels and apps, and other places where any Fox Nation Services are authorized by Fox to be made available. As set forth in our Terms of Use, the Fox Nation Services are for a general audience, are not directed to children, and Fox does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16 years of age on or through the Fox Nation Services.\r\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Fox Nation Services, including both those who use the Fox Nation Services without being registered for the Fox Nation Services and those who have registered. This Privacy Policy applies to Fox’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address).  It also describes generally Fox’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics and services usage). \r\n\n2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION\r\n\nFox and our service providers may collect the following information from and about you:\r\n\nRegistration Information is the information you submit to register for the Fox Nation Services, for example, to create a Fox Nation account, post comments, receive a newsletter or mobile alert, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code, birthday, phone number, political view, and household income. In addition, Fox may collect information you provide to us when you respond to surveys, set your preferences, contact Fox through customer service or by other means, or participate in promotions that Fox may offer from time to time. Fox may allow for multiple profiles to be set up under one account. If this occurs, we may collect information you provide to us if you create a profile.\r\n\nPublic Information and Posts consist of comments or content that you post to the Fox Nation Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture.  Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.   \r\n\nInformation from Social Media.  If you access or log-in to the Fox Nation Services through a social media service or connect a Fox Nation Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service.  When you access the Fox Nation Services through social media services or when you connect a Fox Nation Service to social media services, you are authorizing Fox to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\t\r\n\nActivity Information.  When you access and interact with the Fox Nation Services, Fox and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to the Fox Nation Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the Fox Nation Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device.  \r\n\nCookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, local storage, and other mechanisms) use various approaches to collect and store data. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address).  Fox’s websites, apps and other services use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Fox Nation Services, such as pages you have visited, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed.\r\n\nOther parties that support the Fox Nation Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Fox Nation Service usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Fox Nation Services or other parties’ services (such as website and emails). Those parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. Fox does not control these technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of parties using such technologies. For more information about third party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled “To deliver relevant advertisements,” below.\r\n\nYour browser may be initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, and to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information, including on how to clear data from local storage, and depending on your browser, how to turn off other data collection by the browser.   Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the Fox Nation Services. \r\n\nInformation from Other Sources. We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information about your online and offline activity from social media services, advertising technology companies, advertisers, commercially available sources, and information from our Fox Affiliates or business partners. \r\n\nAuthenticated Content. To access certain Content via the Fox Nation Services, you may be redirected to your television content provider’s registration page, and/or you may be required to register directly with your television content provider. Any information that you provide to your television content provider will be subject to the applicable television content provider’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, your television content provider’s use of personal information.\r\n\nDo Not Track Signals.  At this time we do not respond to browser 'Do Not Track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.\r\n\n3. USE AND DISCLOSURE\r\n\nWe may use the information we collect from and about you to provide the Fox Nation Services and features to you, including to measure and improve those Fox Nation Services and features and to develop new products and services; to improve your experience with both online and off-line Fox Nation Services by delivering content you will find relevant and interesting, including advertising and marketing messages; to allow you to comment on content, and participate in online games, contests, other promotions, special offers, or rewards programs; to provide you with customer support and to respond to inquiries. In order to provide you with content and advertising that is more interesting and relevant to you, we may use the information from and about you to make inferences and predictions about your potential areas of interest. When the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person, we may use that  information for any purpose or share it with other parties, to the extent permitted by applicable law.\r\n\nWe use the information we collect from and about you for these additional purposes:\r\n\nTo allow service providers to assist us in providing and managing the Fox Nation Services. The information we collect from and about you may be made available to certain service providers, such as contractors, analytics and other measurement companies, agents or sponsors, who help us analyze and understand your use of the Fox Nation Services, and manage and/or provide the Fox Nation Services.\r\n\nTo deliver video content. In the ordinary course of our business, we may share information that we collect from or about you to third parties in order to process your requests and fulfill your orders for video content offered through the Fox Nation Services, including to provide you with access to localized content and provide video content recommendations.  For example, to process your request to view certain authenticated video content through the Fox Nation Services, we may need to share information about you with your designated television content provider and/or our third party service providers in order to authenticate and/or authorize you to view authenticated video content through the Fox Nation Services.\r\n\nTo allow social sharing functionality. If you log in with or connect a social media service account to the Fox Nation Services, we may share your user name, picture, and likes, as well as your activities and comments with other Fox Nation Services’ users and with your friends associated with your social media service. We may also share the same information with the social media service provider.  By logging in with or connecting your Fox Nation Services account with a social media service, you are authorizing us to share information we collect from and about you with the social media service provider, other users, and your friends and you understand that the social media service’s use of the shared information will be governed by the social media service’s privacy policy. If you do not want your personal information shared in this way, please do not connect your social media service account with your Fox Nation Services account and do not participate in social sharing on the Fox Nation Services.\r\n\nTo provide co-branded services and features. We may offer co-branded services or features, such as contests, sweepstakes, special offers, or other promotions together with companies (“Co-Branded Services”). These Co-Branded Services may be hosted on the Fox Nation Services or on that other party’s service. By virtue of these relationships, we may share the information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with that party. The other party’s use of your information will be governed by its privacy policy.\r\n\nTo deliver relevant advertisements. Fox Nation Services and our service providers may use the information we collect from and about you as described in this Privacy Policy to deliver relevant ads to you when you use the Fox Nation Services (on any of your devices). To find out more about advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see https://youradchoices.com/. If you wish to opt out of tailored advertising in desktop and mobile browsers, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ or http://optout.networkadvertising.org/# on each of your devices and browsers. To opt out in mobile apps, you may use your device’s setting to opt out of ads personalization or similar settings or download and use the AppChoices app at  https://youradchoices.com/appchoices. To opt out on connected TVs, please use the setting to opt out of ads personalization, “Interest-based Ads,” or equivalent settings on your device.

If you want to stop receiving promotional materials, you can follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email. There are certain service notification and other non-promotional emails that you may not opt-out of, such as notifications of changes to the Fox Nation Services or policies. If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can change the settings either on your mobile device or through the app.\r\n\nTo share with our Affiliates. Fox may share your information with Fox Affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. A link to a website that lists Fox Affiliates can be found at the beginning of this policy. Users who visit Fox Affiliates’ services should still refer to their separate privacy policies, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy. \r\n\nTo share with business partners. Fox may share your information with business partners to permit them to send you marketing communications, consistent with your choices.\r\n\nTo protect the rights of Fox and others. There may be instances when Fox may use or disclose your information, including situations where Fox has a good faith belief that such use or disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of Fox, our Fox Affiliates or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our Terms of Use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the Fox Nation Services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.\r\n\nTo complete a merger or sale of assets. If Fox sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business (including in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceedings), Fox may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.\r\n\nOther Uses. We may also use the information we collect for any other uses in accordance with our Terms of Use and any other purpose that is disclosed to you at the time we collect the information or that is related to a request made by you.\r\n\n4. SECURITY \r\n\nFox uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures designed to safeguard information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information.\r\n\n5.

The Fox Nation Services are hosted in and managed from the United States.  If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States or in any other country in which we have facilities or in which we engage service providers.

The Fox Nation Services may be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies.

Download the fox nation app, just to listen to his in-depth conversations with individuals who can educate us and really break down what’s going on in a way we can understand it. \n\nLove Fox, I just only trust a handful of people on there including Mark Levin who encourages me just as much as Tucker.","title":"Tucker Carlson Today","userName":"tylerkeyes"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6965574469","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-07T14:41:04Z","rating":5,"review":"I’m a DAV and I enjoy all the stories. Lara Logan is one of my favorite. Ever since I found out Black Rifle Coffee was Vet owned I’ve used there coffee. I didn’t really know a lot about the company. Then I read Modern Warriors by Pete Hegseth. I read about Matt Best co- owner of Black Rifle. Then I ran across Lara  interview with Black Rifle Coffee owners. It was really eye opening about the founding of the company but all of the  Black Rifle Coffee organizations they support without any recognition. \nFox Nation is a great app. A well worth app to download and have to view all sort of stories and News. The people that tell the stories and represent Fox Nation seem to be really down to earth. Someone if you met them it would probably be like you’ve know them for ever. Most stuff on tv these days you just don’t know what to believe so I left tv long ago. Thought I’ve only had Fox Nation app a year it’s been Great.","title":"Just all the Best Stories","userName":"Military retired"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7336466725","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-05-14T07:01:55Z","rating":5,"review":"I want to know about the good, bad, and ugly that is happening in my Country, State, and Community.  Knowledge is power, and that power should be shared. Tucker shares a little bit of that knowledge with his viewers and allows the viewers to gain more insight into current events, which will enable them to formulate their own opinions on current hot topics. It is done with compassion, a touch of sense of humor, and given without false emotion or fake empathy. Viewers don't have to agree with Carlson’s worldview or political ideology. We are given the power to formulate our own opinions through his more in-depth coverage. This show shines a brighter light on important issues that demand our attention. It does not tell me how to think. It allows me to be aware and informed on issues and provides context with background information. Well done.","title":"Tucker Carlson Original","userName":"Someone who swears too much"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7295139482","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-05-04T01:01:36Z","rating":5,"review":"Yesterday, I watched Fox News at a friends house against my better judgement. I was quite ready to hear some Biden bashing. When I heard them reporting on how strong the economy is bouncing back in Biden’s first 100 days, I couldn’t believe it. The next segment debated Biden’s economic plan going forward, featuring live guests who argued BOTH SIDES in an intellectual and intelligent manner. It made all the other news networks seem contrived, like they were trying persuade me with ideas that stretched the facts, just enough to be helpful in their cause. So although steadfast in my beliefs, I’m gonna have a listen here anyway, because it sure felt less  contrived and a more of an honest approach to getting news on current events. Realizing truthfulness and honesty supersedes any political loyalty I may have.","title":"To those afraid to listen to Fox News","userName":"SoundofKnowledge"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1436672840","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"Full access with monthly billing"},"isMerchandisedEnabled":false,"isMerchandisedVisibleByDefault":false,"isSubscription":true,"name":"Monthly","offerName":"com.foxnews.nation.monthly","releaseDate":"2009-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","subscriptionFamilyId":"20478903","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monthly/id1419779267"},"relationships":{"offers":{"data":[{"id":"ember71228037","type":"offer"}]}}},{"id":"1436672182","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"Lock in the lowest price for a full year."},"isMerchandisedEnabled":false,"isMerchandisedVisibleByDefault":false,"isSubscription":true,"name":"Patriot","offerName":"com.foxnews.nation.yearly","releaseDate":"2009-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","subscriptionFamilyId":"20478903","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/patriot/id1419779267"},"relationships":{"offers":{"data":[{"id":"ember71228038","type":"offer"}]}}},{"id":"367623543","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1559236118","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"333177961","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"406055530","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1195135449","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1080655620","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"722987199","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1391758874","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1414478547","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"670443321","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1477317200","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"878180850","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1506596700","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"284963689","type":"media/developer","attributes":{"genreNames":[],"name":"Fox News Network, LLC","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/fox-news-network-llc/id284963689"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6009","type":"media/genre","attributes":{"name":"News","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/id6009","parentName":"App Store","parentId":"36"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6016","type":"media/genre","attributes":{"name":"Entertainment","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/id6016","parentName":"App Store","parentId":"36"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1419779267-appletvos","type":"media/app-platform","attributes":{"bundleId":"com.foxnews.nation","editorialArtwork":{"brandLogo":{"width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features124/v4/9b/96/9e/9b969ea5-0e8e-7fd7-2e1a-7ea5ce8ddf32/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor4":"b7b7b7"}},"hasInAppPurchases":true,"hasMessagesExtension":false,"isAppleWatchSupported":false,"isGameCenterEnabled":false,"isHiddenFromSpringboard":false,"isSiriSupported":false,"releaseDate":"2018-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","requiresGameController":false,"subtitle":"Daily Live Shows \u0026 Specials","supportsGameController":false,"supportsPassbook":false,"copyright":"© 2021 FOX News Network, LLC.
