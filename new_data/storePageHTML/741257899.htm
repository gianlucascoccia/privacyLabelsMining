    The must have for anime fans
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I cannot stress enough about how amazing (and simple to use) this app is. This is the app I would recommend to anyone who is just starting to watch anime or read manga. First off, it’s feature to view the english title of series’ and manga by default is extremely helpful, and yes, you can also set it to display the Japanese titles. A feature that is so simple and helpful that the competition cannot implement is one of the hundreds of reasons why this is the must have. A big part of why I’m a fan of this app is it’s theme. I absolutely love the blue colors and how the anime and manga are categorized. Wether it’s the anime of the season, the most popular, the highest rated, or the ones trending, the app handles it all perfectly. I can go on and on about the unique features that make it so pleasing to use (such as it the animes images, titles, sequels and prequels, the episode count, the extremely helpful rating systems they have, etc), but just know that you will not be disappointed with this for tracking your anime and manga. Easiest 5/5 for me. <br />If a developer gets this review I only really have one issue with the app and it’s its search engine. Even though it works fine and well I feel like it lags a few seconds before I could get results for my searches. It would be great if it was faster or you can see the animes instantly as you type.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app has made tracking what I’m currently watching and keeping tabs on anime/manga that are coming out that I’d like to watch/ read incredibly easy! I use to struggle to remember where I left off when life got busy or continuously look up release dates but with the MyAniList app I don’t have to care about any of that anymore. Just pop open the app and see where I left off, and with the notifications I get updated on new episode drops on everything I’m currently watching and everything that I’m waiting for to be released. It’s got a ridiculously simple user interface as well, so it’s easy to find anything you’re looking for. The only downside of the app isn’t from the app itself but instead from the apple store. If you’re looking for something that happens to be real lewd, the app won’t show it directly due to apples regulations, but there is a really simple work around. Just search one of the voice actors for the show or the mangas author/artist. When you select them it brings up a list of all their work. Just scroll through that until you find the manga/anime you’re looking for and add it to your list 🤙🏻</p>

    I only have 3 issues

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have come to find the regardless of these 3 issues, I enjoy the app endlessly and it has been a joy to use! My only problems starting off with my biggest one is that when I go to my profile it never updates all the anime’s I have watched and time I’ve watched anime. It was one of my favorite things to look at before cause it just is pretty awesome to look back at and see everything I’ve watched but I’m at 171 completes anime’s and it still tells me I have only watched 54 animes! It’s annoying but at the same time not enough for me to hate the app. As well as my other 2 issues being small that when I try to chance the app icons color to something else it doesn’t change its color but it will change it if I search up the app in the search bar for IOS. Lastly I just wish I could tap on the pictures of anime’s and mangas and it increase the size of it so I can get a better look at it and decide it I wanna watch it but that’s just a luxury problem is all. This app is amazing and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed using it and I hope you continue to update the app because it will have my continual use and support!</p>

This was previously limited to just your lists.\n- IMPROVEMENT: Lots of refinements to the UI and text. Screens, font sizes, widgets now all feel similar across the board. If you're using iOS 13, you'll get to see native iOS icons for the tab bar, settings, and actions.\n- IMPROVEMENT: We're working really hard to try and reduce the time it takes to synchronize your lists from AniList.co. With this latest update, you should see the time to update decrease quite a bit!\n- NOTE: This release drops iOS 10 support.

This filter is dependent on the mature content policy set in your AniList profile. You can update this setting by visiting your account settings online, under the \"Anime \u0026 Manga\" category. \n- OTHER: Internal code cleanup.\n\n---\n\nPreviously:\n\nThe 2.5.0 [Asuka] release is dedicated to all of you tsunderes who have secretly always wanted to synchronize movements with someone else in an Evangelion. \"What are you, stupid?\"\n\nFirst off, I just want to thank all of you for your patience! These past few months have been busy for me on a very personal level, and unfortunately, that has caused a significant delay in this release. However, I'm proud to announce that a long-awaited feature is now finally available: viewing your profile! Replacing the Friends tab is your Profile. Browse through your followers, who you're following, and your favorites!\n\nSpeaking of favorites, you can now favorite all the things! Simply tap on the star icon on the top right of each screen (for anime and manga, it's within the more menu) to favorite something! Don't like it anymore? Tap it again to unfavorite! It's that easy. :)\n\nThe full set of release notes, for those who like the granular details:\n\n- NEW: A brand new Profile screen! Profile picture, cover picture, stats, and more. Tap on your followers/following count to view who you follow and who's following you!\n- NEW: Favorite support is now available. Go on, find your waifu and/or husbando and favorite them!\n- NEW: You can now search for users in Discover. Sorry this took so long!\n- FIXED: Prequels, OVAs, and additional related anime/manga would sometimes not appear in anime/manga details pages.\n- FIXED: Fixed a bug where the start and end dates of when you started/finished a series would sometimes not show up.\n- FIXED: Adjusted scrolling behavior to be more flush with the navigation bar when tapping on the tab bar to scroll back up.\n- FIXED: Sorting order for actors now follows Japanese, followed by English, followed by the remaining languages.\n- ADJUSTMENT: Removed the \"Remove\" button when editing anime/manga with the quick edit functionality. You can still remove a series by tapping into the more menu.\n- OTHER: Updated libraries and language support to shrink the application size by a bit!\n\nGot feedback? I'd love to hear from you! Join our Discord channel through the app and get in on the fun.\n\nThanks again for your patience, and happy watching and reading!","releaseDate":"2019-07-15"}],"hasPrivacyPolicyText":false,"supportedLocales":[{"name":"English","tag":"en-US"}],"customAttributes":{"default":{"default":{"customScreenshotsByType":{"iphone6+":[{"width":1242,"height":2208,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/4e/8b/3e/4e8b3eef-614e-974d-b196-6562e1e1cc79/mzl.olcaoiwz.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"fefefe","textColor2":"bbbbc5","textColor3":"cbcfd9","textColor4":"9599ac"},{"width":1242,"height":2208,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/00/b9/72/00b97251-fb32-8d1d-d7ae-a8d5d9da2fd8/mzl.zxgayzxo.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"fefefe","textColor2":"bbbbc5","textColor3":"cbcfd9","textColor4":"9599ac"},{"width":1242,"height":2208,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/53/0d/c1/530dc17e-7a03-d2ab-61f8-615ec9f6f203/mzl.ceaotqid.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"fefefe","textColor2":"bbbbc5","textColor3":"cbcfd9","textColor4":"9599ac"},{"width":1242,"height":2208,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/e2/2d/40/e22d406e-5ef3-583a-e116-f9f9c360a581/mzl.stkcnipi.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"fefefe","textColor2":"bbbbc5","textColor3":"cbcfd9","textColor4":"9599ac"},{"width":1242,"height":2208,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/17/84/9f/17849f09-4542-5064-9f84-86a49f488793/mzl.cfrftumu.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"fefefe","textColor2":"bbbbc5","textColor3":"cbcfd9","textColor4":"9599ac"}],"iphone_6_5":[{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/06/56/53/06565394-3955-630c-66b0-313b4c3dfa3a/mzl.dbmmkdkg.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"e4e4e4","textColor3":"cbcfd9","textColor4":"b6bac4"},{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/78/2c/cd/782ccd6c-9fb1-1d64-dea5-319770bfb611/mzl.ymadryum.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"dfdbde","textColor3":"cbcfd9","textColor4":"b2b3bf"},{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/09/c7/0c/09c70cbb-109c-ada0-08e9-af8ab837b982/mzl.znmtnqcd.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"dfdbde","textColor3":"cbcfd9","textColor4":"b2b3bf"},{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/2e/9a/b7/2e9ab70f-678d-0331-ff93-c722e730ce5b/mzl.duuyoskt.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"dfdbde","textColor3":"cbcfd9","textColor4":"b2b3bf"},{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/1c/f5/14/1cf514a3-dc26-a598-0e96-f71f850a272b/mzl.rufmfrgh.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"dfdbde","textColor3":"cbcfd9","textColor4":"b2b3bf"},{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/1a/91/3b/1a913bc5-b4cd-0a29-b440-d79c547a4d7d/mzl.lghrjmrt.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"dfdbde","textColor3":"cbcfd9","textColor4":"b2b3bf"}],"ipadPro":[{"width":2732,"height":2048,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/29/11/a3/2911a35f-e7f5-b002-04bf-ee72051c71f5/mzl.hgperhbu.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"f3f4f8","textColor2":"e7d5d1","textColor3":"c2c7d4","textColor4":"b8aeb5"},{"width":2732,"height":2048,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/9e/0a/93/9e0a9373-e34c-b858-767d-d407fa7f319f/mzl.otlynyro.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"f7f7fa","textColor2":"c3c9c7","textColor3":"c6cad6","textColor4":"9ca4ad"},{"width":2732,"height":2048,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/91/8b/e6/918be6f5-74ec-8ef0-f26e-3fe51363628c/mzl.oadyzgdp.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"fefefe","textColor2":"317ef3","textColor3":"cbcfd9","textColor4":"2768d0"},{"width":2732,"height":2048,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/5f/e5/a8/5fe5a80c-8619-0a98-011f-d0fea6d04d42/mzl.xbxtoheb.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"fefefe","textColor2":"c4cdcb","textColor3":"cbcfd9","textColor4":"9da7b0"},{"width":2732,"height":2048,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/58/e5/74/58e57486-f3fb-fec1-c8e5-d6fcd0847bf4/mzl.tzjrmmxp.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"e6bc12","textColor3":"cbcfd9","textColor4":"b89a1c"}],"ipadPro_2018":[{"width":2732,"height":2048,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/dd/14/4f/dd144fc1-4677-b703-53d7-2a6ae55bf997/mzl.uvllhlbo.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"001246","textColor1":"fcfeff","textColor2":"d7dbef","textColor3":"c9ced9","textColor4":"acb3cd"},{"width":2732,"height":2048,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.c

This is the app I would recommend to anyone who is just starting to watch anime or read manga. First off, it’s feature to view the english title of series’ and manga by default is extremely helpful, and yes, you can also set it to display the Japanese titles. A feature that is so simple and helpful that the competition cannot implement is one of the hundreds of reasons why this is the must have. A big part of why I’m a fan of this app is it’s theme. I absolutely love the blue colors and how the anime and manga are categorized. Wether it’s the anime of the season, the most popular, the highest rated, or the ones trending, the app handles it all perfectly. I can go on and on about the unique features that make it so pleasing to use (such as it the animes images, titles, sequels and prequels, the episode count, the extremely helpful rating systems they have, etc), but just know that you will not be disappointed with this for tracking your anime and manga. Easiest 5/5 for me. \nIf a developer gets this review I only really have one issue with the app and it’s its search engine. Even though it works fine and well I feel like it lags a few seconds before I could get results for my searches.

I use to struggle to remember where I left off when life got busy or continuously look up release dates but with the MyAniList app I don’t have to care about any of that anymore. Just pop open the app and see where I left off, and with the notifications I get updated on new episode drops on everything I’m currently watching and everything that I’m waiting for to be released. It’s got a ridiculously simple user interface as well, so it’s easy to find anything you’re looking for. The only downside of the app isn’t from the app itself but instead from the apple store. If you’re looking for something that happens to be real lewd, the app won’t show it directly due to apples regulations, but there is a really simple work around. Just search one of the voice actors for the show or the mangas author/artist. When you select them it brings up a list of all their work.

My only problems starting off with my biggest one is that when I go to my profile it never updates all the anime’s I have watched and time I’ve watched anime. It was one of my favorite things to look at before cause it just is pretty awesome to look back at and see everything I’ve watched but I’m at 171 completes anime’s and it still tells me I have only watched 54 animes! It’s annoying but at the same time not enough for me to hate the app. As well as my other 2 issues being small that when I try to chance the app icons color to something else it doesn’t change its color but it will change it if I search up the app in the search bar for IOS. Lastly I just wish I could tap on the pictures of anime’s and mangas and it increase the size of it so I can get a better look at it and decide it I wanna watch it but that’s just a luxury problem is all.

Recently, however, MAL had an update to where if you marked to many anime done, on hold, or updated the amount of episodes watched consecutively it would place a ban on your IP address. I don’t know the reason behind this, probably a security reason, but it is frustrating nonetheless. At first I read my ban would last a few hours but its been well over 2 days! I proceeded to the FAQ to try and find a way to fix it but I’ve had no luck figuring it out. This isn’t that big of a deal, as I’m sure it’ll fix itself, but like I said it is frustrating.\n\nHowever, the app is still really useful for viewing the upcoming seasonal anime, and also any anime you search up. It has had literally every anime I’ve ever searched listed and with a super detailed synopsis attached. It’s a super easy to use app that’s helped me out a lot over my anime watching career.

For example Samurai Champloo is ranked 74th. In the app we have no clue what that means, is it all time, is it just for 2020, is it in one of the several genres it falls under, or is it the year/season it was released? (The 74th stands for all time TV Show in this case which I found through the AniList website.) On the website it shows this information as well as the other categories it’s ranked in and has a link that takes you to each list. But for a 3rd party app that’s just an extension of AniList I have to say it’s amazing. It’s quick, has a nice layout, and keeps your AniList progress with an easy to access app. I’d rate this app a 9.5/10 but it would easily be perfect for me if it had that rankings feature.","title":"Almost Perfect","userName":"OlisaUzu"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4287189216","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-06-09T05:10:07Z","rating":4,"review":"So as the title says, I just started using an online database. It took me about 1-2 hours to input everything that I’ve watched and rated them. And using this app is really nice to update on the fly. \n\nOne thing I’ve noticed though is that searching for an anime/manga to add to the list is kinda long. The search progress is a long wait before it shows results. That’s why I used the actually website after a couple. I would have been there for a real long while adding to my list. But after getting everything added, it’s no problem adding an anime here and there as you finish them. \n\nThe last thing is more of a feature request. I noticed that the website version (which I know has nothing to do with this app) has an account overview showing me a bunch of stats about me. I really love that feature on the web version and I wish that this app can add this somewhere in here.

Just get these two problems fixed and it’ll be perfect\n\nUpdate: \n\nMyAniList is actually really good I’ve managed to fix the list problem where it deletes it on computer but it may still be an issue for some user don’t take my word for it but overall really great app it’s basically the more sleek version of myanimelist with a little slower loading results when searching up anime. \n\nUpdate 2.0 \n\nThese problems might be fixed still have yet to find out but from what I’ve seen it seems to be fixed.","title":"Great app with only two issues.

Add to that how consistently their site seems to go down recently, and it became clear that I needed an alternative to keep track of my read and watched lists.\n\nEnter MyAniList. Not only was I able to easily and seamlessly transition my lists over from MAL through the desktop site, but the UI and overall design of the app is everything I was looking for in an anime/manga tracking app. I still actively use MAL as a backup, but MyAniList delivers in a way MAL has never done. So if you’re on the fence, it’s definitely worth a shot. The features are absolutely amazing and the low cost to upgrade to the premium is also worth it. No regrets here.","title":"Awesome App, great MAL alternative","userName":"KL2789"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5994216007","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-05-26T01:37:39Z","rating":5,"review":"I started on MyAnimeList like most other people since it is somewhat of a standard or go-to for avid anime watchers. But I happened to stumble upon the website and really enjoyed how it was laid out so I took to getting the app. I really like how customizable it is and how clean and updated the layout looks. I particularly like that you can unlock special features in the app through a one time purchase of which you can choose from 3 different affordable prices, the lowest of which, $1.99. They don’t make you commit to a subscription or a large amount in order to unlock even more of a customizable approach to your app, which is something I can really appreciate. I enjoy helping out people and developers but not everyone can afford subscriptions and such so it is very nice that the app/website doesn’t ask for much from the users.

It is helpful for manga readers as well as there is a tab for tracking manga, however there are many features that could be added to make this app MUCH better.\nId like to see drop down menus of anime from past seasons so people could revisit their fav anime from the past years, as well as a scrolling list where you could see ALL anime and manga ranked #. The only ranking numbers you see are when you click on an individual anime/manga, but I’d like to see them all together in one list just to make it easier for everyone. I’d probs give this app 5 stars if more features are added to make the app more enjoyable. Besides this, however, it is a very useful and easy-to-use app that I’ve relied on for a long time!","title":"^_^ Good,

There were cases where marking shows as completed on your list would sometimes not get persisted correctly on AniList.co, thus causing the mismatch between your list, your profile, and AniList.co. This will go through any shows that are in this bad state and will re-save them to the website!

They're rather elegant yet important, just like her.\n\n- NEW: Dynamic Text support finally arrives! This has been a large feature request to include adjusted font sizing from iOS settings. If you've adjusted the size of text through your Accessibility settings, you'll see these changes be reflected in MyAniList!\n- FIXED: There was previously an issue where updating manga from AniList.co would not sync correctly to the manga list in MyAniList. This is now fixed. If you're still seeing this not work, please try going to Settings \u003e General \u003e Reset Last List Update Time.\n- IMPROVEMENT: Better messaging on why certain series may not be showing up.\n- IMPROVEMENT: If you have a custom size set for your list, the posters across the app now reflect your preference! This was previously limited to just your lists.\n- IMPROVEMENT: Lots of refinements to the UI and text. Screens, font sizes, widgets now all feel similar across the board. If you're using iOS 13, you'll get to see native iOS icons for the tab bar, settings, and actions.\n- IMPROVEMENT: We're working really hard to try and reduce the time it takes to synchronize your lists from AniList.co. With this latest update, you should see the time to update decrease quite a bit!\n- NOTE: This release drops iOS 10 support. To continue receiving updates for MyAniList, please ensure your device is up-to-date with the latest version of iOS!\n\nAs always, we'd love to hear what you have to say about MyAniList! Feel free to join our Discord server, or send us a message on Twitter or email!\n\nI do want to apologize for the lack of recent updates. Due to the heavy burden of juggling both graduate school and work, it's been difficult to squeeze in time for MyAniList. But rest assured that I am trying my hardest, and that I really appreciate y'all's patience! Thank you all so much for deciding to use MyAniList. Y'all are the best. \u003c3 - Corey","releaseDate":"2019-11-22"},{"versionDisplay":"2.5.8","releaseNotes":"This update fixes an issue with some profile stats not showing accurate values sometimes, such as \"Days Watched\" and \"Chapters Read\".

Additionally, this will clear your progress count for you! How handy!\n- FIXED: Fixed a cosmetic issue where series that were repeating would still show \"Watching\" / \"Reading\" as the current status in the details page.\n- FIXED: Added in a similar rewatching/rereading confirmation dialogue whenever the progress gets set to \"Rewatching\" / \"Rereading\".\n- FIXED: Fixed an issue where MyAniList news would sometimes not update on its scheduled time during app launch.\n- FIXED: Increased the hard limit for current episode and chapter updates to a whopping 99,999.

This filter is dependent on the mature content policy set in your AniList profile. You can update this setting by visiting your account settings online, under the \"Anime \u0026 Manga\" category. \n- OTHER: Internal code cleanup.\n\n---\n\nPreviously:\n\nThe 2.5.0 [Asuka] release is dedicated to all of you tsunderes who have secretly always wanted to synchronize movements with someone else in an Evangelion. \"What are you, stupid?\"\n\nFirst off, I just want to thank all of you for your patience! These past few months have been busy for me on a very personal level, and unfortunately, that has caused a significant delay in this release. However, I'm proud to announce that a long-awaited feature is now finally available: viewing your profile! Replacing the Friends tab is your Profile. Browse through your followers, who you're following, and your favorites!\n\nSpeaking of favorites, you can now favorite all the things! Simply tap on the star icon on the top right of each screen (for anime and manga, it's within the more menu) to favorite something! Don't like it anymore? Tap it again to unfavorite! It's that easy. :)\n\nThe full set of release notes, for those who like the granular details:\n\n- NEW: A brand new Profile screen! Profile picture, cover picture, stats, and more. Tap on your followers/following count to view who you follow and who's following you!\n- NEW: Favorite support is now available. Go on, find your waifu and/or husbando and favorite them!\n- NEW: You can now search for users in Discover. Sorry this took so long!\n- FIXED: Prequels, OVAs, and additional related anime/manga would sometimes not appear in anime/manga details pages.\n- FIXED: Fixed a bug where the start and end dates of when you started/finished a series would sometimes not show up.\n- FIXED: Adjusted scrolling behavior to be more flush with the navigation bar when tapping on the tab bar to scroll back up.\n- FIXED: Sorting order for actors now follows Japanese, followed by English, followed by the remaining languages.\n- ADJUSTMENT: Removed the \"Remove\" button when editing anime/manga with the quick edit functionality. You can still remove a series by tapping into the more menu.\n- OTHER: Updated libraries and language support to shrink the application size by a bit!\n\nGot feedback? I'd love to hear from you! Join our Discord channel through the app and get in on the fun.\n\nThanks again for your patience, and happy watching and reading!","releaseDate":"2019-07-15"}],"languageList":["English"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"privacyPolicyUrl":"https://gist.github.com/croberts22/518dc56f367e2324a908fc067567353e","requirementsString":"Requires iOS 13.0 or later.
