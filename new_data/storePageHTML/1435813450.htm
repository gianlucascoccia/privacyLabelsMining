        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Vooks is a unique and compelling streaming storybook site that brings books to life for preschool and elementary school aged kids. The stories aren’t only read aloud, but are also animated like a 10-minute (or so) film. The stories are narrated with various fun voices and accompanying music, keeping young readers and listeners attention.  <br />  <br />And it’s easy to use! Just choose a storybook, click on play, and watch and listen. The text appears on each page and is highlighted as the narrator reads each word, encouraging the child to read along. <br />  <br />There are numerous types and themes of books, such as be brave, be creative, biographies, and more. So, the streaming storybooks aren’t only entertaining, but informative and character-building too. There are also lesson plans and other resources for extended learning. <br />  <br />This animated storybook concept is so fun. I wish I had Vooks when I was a child. I’m thrilled with my new subscription and look forward to reading and listening to the variety of animated stories with my grandson. <br /> <br />Disclosure: Many thanks to Vooks for providing this product/product information for review. Opinions are 100% my own and NOT influenced by monetary compensation. I did receive a sample of the product in exchange for this review and post.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>My elementary aged kids love this app. I love it also but what else is wonderful is there are activities that go with the animated story books (on their website) so it’s more than just enjoying a good story. There is a large quantity of books with the subscription compared to other apps and services. The quality of the books and animation is stellar. The organization of the books by age, topic and etc make it easy for you to supplement with the theme you are teaching. App runs smoothly and no bugs I have experienced yet. I feel confident in the safety and quality of the materials. You could let your child use this app on their own without worry. I’m especially looking forward to delving into some of the biographies next. 5 well earned stars for Vooks app.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>We have never downloaded a kid app yet (4yr-old and 2-yr old) and I was unsure about the slippery slope of them begging for screen time.   We got Vooks to supplement our book collection since we cannot go to the library during the pandemic.   I am pleased to report this app is darling and pretty darn close to reading a real book only BETTER.   Keeps their attention and encourages their love of reading.  And gives this momma a quick break during all of this quarantine business.   I am so thankful I found this app.   We will definitely keep our subscription indefinitely.  Thank you!</p>

However, We will normally collect Personal Information and Data from You only where We have Your consent to do so, where We need the Personal Information and/or Data to perform a contract with You, or where the processing is in Our legitimate interests is not outweighed by Your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, We may also have a legal obligation to collect and maintain Personal Information and/or Data from You. \n\nb. If We ask You to provide Personal Information and/or Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with You, We will make this clear at the relevant time and advise You whether the provision of Your Personal Information and/or Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if You do not provide Your Personal Information and/or Data).

Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;\n\niv. Processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;\n\nv. Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\n\nvi. Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\n9.

These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of Your Personal Information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of Your Personal Information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability.

In the event that Vooks becomes aware of a security breach which has resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of Personal Information, Vooks will promptly investigate the matter and notify the applicable supervisory authority not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.\n\n11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES  \n\nMost web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting You can activate to signal Your privacy preference not to have data about Your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, We do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates Your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that We must follow in the future, We will inform You about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.  \n\n12.

The stories aren’t only read aloud, but are also animated like a 10-minute (or so) film. The stories are narrated with various fun voices and accompanying music, keeping young readers and listeners attention.  \n  \nAnd it’s easy to use! Just choose a storybook, click on play, and watch and listen. The text appears on each page and is highlighted as the narrator reads each word, encouraging the child to read along. \n  \nThere are numerous types and themes of books, such as be brave, be creative, biographies, and more. So, the streaming storybooks aren’t only entertaining, but informative and character-building too. There are also lesson plans and other resources for extended learning. \n  \nThis animated storybook concept is so fun. I wish I had Vooks when I was a child. I’m thrilled with my new subscription and look forward to reading and listening to the variety of animated stories with my grandson. \n \nDisclosure: Many thanks to Vooks for providing this product/product information for review.

Also wasn’t impressed with the app. It leans too far from reading and is more akin to watching TV with subtitles.
