        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been searching my entire life for answers to why we do what we do, why we feel the way we do. Why certain people have more trauma, tradegy, illness than other’s. Why do I have the anxiety which has led to depression which has led to disease.<br />All of the Answer’s to these and more questions that I am sure many have are answered after watching and learning different cultural ideologies. And what I’ve learned is that we not only as humans bleed the same but the different ideologies of different cultures are the same just called different names. I’ve learned as I have always loved others that each of us is a part of the whole and that we are made to love one another.  And that we are all capable of manifesting health, wealth and spiritually harmonizing Mind, body and Spirit.<br />This channel is the only place to go to get answers to life’s questions no matter what religious beliefs you may have this opens your eyes and your world to how no matter where you come from, your beliefs, color of skin, or heritage we all have pretty much the same beliefs just called different names. And that we are all here for love of one another.</p>

    App is very frustrating

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I very much like the content but no matter what platform I am watching on (new iPhone or internet TV) I have issue with playing a lot of the time and if I am lucky enough that goes well I just pray family doesn’t interrupt me because if I have to hit pause or rewind it’ll crash or freeze virtually every time. I’ve never experienced such a horrible player in all my life. You charge a hefty amount, performance should be better, and I’m sure the high cost is partly because not many people will subscribe to this content so I’m ok with supporting you as you grow your subscriptions however the irony is I watch this for my spiritual side and the amount of frustrations I get trying to be peaceful is anything but. I would recommend you stop adding new content and redirect your resources until you are able to fix this issue. It has caused me to really limit how much I use the app. Btw, our internet speed doesn’t get much better, we’re a top tier and have extra routers to support a house five times our small size. I personally don’t want to spend time with tech support on something that likely is not on our end. I can’t be the only one having issues. Please look into fixing it because I would really like to continue watching more of your programs with ease in the near future.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Holy wow! I’m always surprised by how much I can learn on this app in just a small span of time. Fifteen minutes. An hour. Doesn’t matter. You become a sponge to information that you would normally have a hard time being captivated by and/or retain in traditional conversations. <br /><br />So absolutely worth your time and money. Even in my off months of no watching I’m still happy and proud to support this community and it’s endless beautiful array of healing knowledge. The share feature alone with ANYONE you’d like it magical enough! I’ve turned so many people onto this app by that feature alone. Heck, it’s how I got started! Thanks close pal who shared a quick link to this and forever changed my life. You rock. <br /><br />So incredibly grateful for this medium and that it’s growing larger and assisting people in realizing the beauty and information we already have stowed deep within our selves.</p>

OF USE AND PRIVACY POLICY\n\n(Including Privacy Policy for Children’s Online Privacy Protection\nand “Your Privacy Rights” for California Residents)\nEffective and last revised on November 16, 2015\n\nWelcome to the Gaia websites, which are owned and operated by Gaia, Inc., a Colorado corporation, and its affiliates (collectively, the “Websites”).\nThe Websites may include some or all of the following: (a) a platform for the purchase and use of digital content, which allows end-users to purchase a subscription and stream pre-recorded audio and video content over the Internet for personal use, (b) an e-commerce site, which allows users to purchase products from the Gaia online store, and (c) one or more websites where other online content (including content provided by Gaia, Website users and third parties), resources, tools, products, services, communications and social networking features may be accessed and used. All of the foregoing are collectively referred to as the “Services.”\nPLEASE READ VERY CAREFULLY ALL OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE OF THE WEBSITES. BY ACCESSING AND/OR USING THE WEBSITES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF USE AND PRIVACY POLICY.\n1. Parties. The following Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, as well as any other guidelines, rules or operating policies that Gaia may establish and post at the Websites from time to time, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. All of the foregoing, which are collectively referred to as the \"Agreement,” set forth the terms and conditions of a legally binding contract between each visitor to and/or user of the Websites (together with any business, entity or organization each such visitor and/or user may be representing) (referred to as “you” or “your”) and Gaia, Inc. (“Gaia,” “we,” “our” and “us”).\n2. Acceptance of Terms and Agreement to Be Bound. The Services are offered to you on the condition that you accept and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety without modification of any kind. By accessing and/or using any of our Websites, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a \"Visitor\" (which means that you simply browse one or more of our Websites) or you are a \"Registered User\" (which means that you have registered to use the Websites and have subscribed to use one or more of the Services). If you do not accept the terms of this Agreement, you are not permitted to use the Websites and/or subscribe to the Services, and you are obliged to exit all of the Websites and discontinue any and all use of the Websites and the Services immediately.\n3. Modifications. We may modify this Agreement from time to time, and, to the greatest extent permitted by law, such modifications shall be effective upon posting at any of our Websites. By accessing and/or using any of our Websites after any such modification is posted, you are agreeing to be bound by such modifications. You also acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to monitor the Websites for the posting of modifications and to review such modifications on a regular basis. If you do not agree to be bound by any future modifications of this Agreement, your exclusive remedy is to cancel your account and discontinue your use of the Websites and the Services. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any new features, tools, products and/or services that change, augment, enhance or upgrade the current Websites and/or the Services will be subject to this Agreement.\n4. General Registration Requirements. Visitors are currently permitted to view only limited portions of the Websites prior to deciding whether to become a Registered User. Full access to the Websites and the Services is available only to Registered Users and, if a subscription is required, then only to Registered Users who are also paid subscribers. If you wish to become a Registered User, you must register on our Websites, you must complete the registration procedures displayed on the registration page(s) of the Websites and, where applicable, pay the required subscription fee. Some aspects of the Websites and the Services are available to all Registered Users, and some are available only to Registered Users who have paid the required subscription fee and/or other charges, all of which are posted at the Websites.\n5. Age Requirements for Access and Use of the Websites. By accessing and using the Websites, you acknowledge and agree that you are representing to us that you are over the age of 18 and you are of legal age to form a legally binding contract, and you are not a person barred from purchasing or receiving products and services, under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. Registration, subscription, access to and use of the Websites and the Services are not available to users under the age of 18 and are void where prohibited by applicable law.\n6. Requirements for Becoming a Registered User. By completing the registration procedures displayed on the registration page(s) of the Websites, you acknowledge and agree that (a) you are representing to us that you are providing true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form available on our Websites (the \"Registration Data\"), and (b) you are obliged to maintain and promptly update your Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future access to and/or use of the Websites and the Services (or any portion thereof).\n7. Children. Due to the nature of the Internet, we cannot prohibit minors from visiting our Websites. However, our Websites are not directed toward children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 through the Websites. If you believe that a child has provided information to us through the Websites, please contact us by email at info@Gaia.com or by writing us at Gaia, Inc., 833 W. South Boulder Road, Louisville, Colorado 80027, Attn.: Mai Arnold. We will use our best efforts to remove all of the information provided by the child from our system.

The following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed to third parties:\nWe may employ third parties to perform services or functions on our behalf in order to improve our Websites, merchandising, marketing and promotional efforts, communications or other services. Those third parties may include authorized contractors, consultants and other companies working with us. They only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and they may not share any personal information with others or use it for any other purpose than providing or improving Gaia's services and offerings.\nWe may share your information with third parties whom we believe have information of interest to you. In addition, we may share certain non-personal information with third parties for advertising, promotional and other purposes. For example, we may work with third party advertising companies, to serve and track our ads. These third parties may install other cookies. Our advertising partners may use the non-personal information they collect from our Websites, in the aggregate, to help us better market and serve our customers.\nThis Privacy Policy applies only to the Websites and the Services and does not address the practices of third parties who may collect your personal information. You may visit other websites, through links on the Websites, which may collect, use and share your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. The information practices of those linked websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we encourage you to be very cautious before you disclose your personal information to others. In order to provide you with the information, products or services which you have requested, we may share or transfer your personal information with our parent, affiliates or subsidiaries, or third party agents acting on their behalf.\nThe Gaia Parties may be obligated to cooperate with various law enforcement inquiries. Each Gaia Party reserves the right to disclose or transfer personal information and non-personal information about you and your activities on our Websites in order to comply with a legal requirement or request from law enforcement or other government officials, administrative agencies or third parties as we, in our sole discretion, determine necessary or appropriate for the administration of justice, or in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements or violations of any other law, rule or regulation, our Terms of Use or other rules or policies of our Websites, the rights of third parties, or an investigation of any other activity that may expose us or you to legal liability, or to investigate any suspected conduct which Gaia in its sole discretion deems improper.\n12. Security. Providing a secure site is essential for your peace of mind and trust in Gaia. We have installed encryption software conforming to the Secure Socket Layers (SSL) protocol to safeguard all of the commerce related (i.e. credit card and billing address) information you send to us. Club profile information is not encrypted or secured in any way. All information is stored on our servers in a secure location.

Any claims or complaints must be filed a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Colorado, U.S.A.\n\nYour Privacy Rights (California Residents)\nOnline Privacy Protection Policy for California Residents\n(“Shine the Light” Law)\nEffective as of January 1, 2005, California’s “Shine the Light” law (Cal. Civ. Code Sections 1798.80, et seq.) provides California residents with the right to receive certain disclosures when personal information that has been collected online is shared with third parties for direct-marketing purposes.\nIf you are a California resident and you provided personal information to Gaia through a website in the past, and/or if you do so in the future, you are entitled to submit a request in writing to Gaia for a description of the information we may have provided to third parties. To submit your written request, please send it to info@Gaia.com and put the following words in the subject line of the email: “California Privacy Request.”\nWithin 30 days after receipt of your request, we will send you a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of the third parties who actually received such information, if any.\nWe reserve our right not to respond to requests sent more than once in a calendar year.\nPlease note that the California “Shine the Light” law does not cover all aspects of on-line information sharing, and our policy relates only to information covered by the law.\n\nCOMMUNITY POSTING GUIDELINES:\nAt Gaia, we believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to transform their lives. In the spirit of community, we strive to maintain tolerance, equality and respect. The Internet has opened up a world of opportunity that humanity has never seen before. However, the Internet also gives people the means to insult or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while you’re on Gaia, you respect the people you encounter, as well as their opinions. You’re free to disagree, state your own opinion and provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. Please respect other members’ beliefs, and consider your impact on others when making your contribution. If you can’t conduct yourself in a respectful manner, we reserve the right to remove comments. In extreme cases, we reserve the right to disable the ability to comment.\nWe understand that many of our topics are controversial, and we fully support debate. However, we won’t allow misrepresentation of our brand, show hosts, show guests or any Gaia-affiliated talent to be published on our site. We reserve the right to determine what is a constructive argument and what’s a smear tactic.\nOur comment sections are dedicated to discussion about the content. If you’re experiencing a technical issue with a video, please contact customer service directly at info@Gaia.com. Technical problems posted in the comment section will be deleted once the problem is addressed. If a hyperlink to an external site is posted, we reserve the right to remove the hyperlink, or remove the comment entirely.\n\n\n\nANTI-SPAM POLICY\nAt Gaia we are 100% against spam and unsolicited emails and maintain CANSPAM compliance. We do not sell or provide email addresses to any unauthorized third party and do not authorize any third party or affiliate to misuse products or services created by or associated with Gaia in spam or bulk emails. If you feel you have received any unwanted emails from us, please contact us immediately and we will look into the matter.\nGaia prohibits the use of their website and/or services in any manner associated with the transmission, distribution or delivery of any unsolicited bulk or unsolicited commercial e-mail (“Spam”). You may not use any Gaia services to send Spam. You also may not deliver Spam or cause Spam to be delivered to any customers of Gaia.\nIn compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. 7701, et seq., Public Law No. 108-187, was S.877 of the 108th United States Congress), e-mail sent, or caused to be sent, to or through the Gaia website or service or on behalf of Gaia may not:\n•\tuse or contain false, misleading, invalid or forged headers\n•\tuse deceptive or misleading subject lines\n•\tuse or contain invalid or non-existent domain names;\n•\temploy any technique to otherwise misrepresent, hide or obscure any information in identifying the point of origin or the transmission path;\n•\tuse other means of deceptive addressing;\n•\tuse a third party’s internet domain name, or be relayed from or through a third party’s equipment, without permission of the third party;\n•\tcontain false or misleading information in the subject line or otherwise contain false or misleading content;\n•\tfail to comply with additional technical standards described below;\n•\totherwise violate our Terms of Use.\n\nGaia does not authorize the harvesting, mining or collection of e-mail addresses or other information from or through the website or its services.

Gaia does not permit or authorize any attempt to use its services in a manner that could damage, disable, overburden or impair any aspect of any of the services, or that could interfere with any other party’s use and enjoyment of any Gaia service.\nIf Gaia believes that unauthorized or improper use is being made of any service, it may, without notice, take such action as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate, including blocking messages from a particular internet domain, mail server or IP address. Gaia may immediately terminate any account on any service which it determines, in its sole discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected with any e-mail that violates this policy.\nNothing in this policy is intended to grant any right to transmit or send e-mail to, or through, the Gaia website and/or services. Failure to enforce this policy in every instance does not amount to a waiver of Gaia’s rights.\nUnauthorized use of any Gaia services in connection with the transmission of unsolicited e-mail, including the transmission of e-mail in violation of this policy, may result in civil, criminal, or administrative penalties against the sender and those assisting the sender.\nViolators of the CAN SPAM Act may be subject to “cease and desist” orders or penalties from the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) of up to $11,000 per violation. Criminal prosecution is also possible in the case of egregious offenders, which can result in penalties such as fines, forfeiture of proceeds and equipment.

All of the foregoing are collectively referred to as the “Services.”\nPLEASE READ VERY CAREFULLY ALL OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE OF THE WEBSITES. BY ACCESSING AND/OR USING THE WEBSITES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF USE AND PRIVACY POLICY.\n1. Parties. The following Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, as well as any other guidelines, rules or operating policies that Gaia may establish and post at the Websites from time to time, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. All of the foregoing, which are collectively referred to as the \"Agreement,” set forth the terms and conditions of a legally binding contract between each visitor to and/or user of the Websites (together with any business, entity or organization each such visitor and/or user may be representing) (referred to as “you” or “your”) and Gaia, Inc. (“Gaia,” “we,” “our” and “us”).\n2. Acceptance of Terms and Agreement to Be Bound. The Services are offered to you on the condition that you accept and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety without modification of any kind. By accessing and/or using any of our Websites, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a \"Visitor\" (which means that you simply browse one or more of our Websites) or you are a \"Registered User\" (which means that you have registered to use the Websites and have subscribed to use one or more of the Services). If you do not accept the terms of this Agreement, you are not permitted to use the Websites and/or subscribe to the Services, and you are obliged to exit all of the Websites and discontinue any and all use of the Websites and the Services immediately.\n3. Modifications. We may modify this Agreement from time to time, and, to the greatest extent permitted by law, such modifications shall be effective upon posting at any of our Websites. By accessing and/or using any of our Websites after any such modification is posted, you are agreeing to be bound by such modifications. You also acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to monitor the Websites for the posting of modifications and to review such modifications on a regular basis. If you do not agree to be bound by any future modifications of this Agreement, your exclusive remedy is to cancel your account and discontinue your use of the Websites and the Services. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any new features, tools, products and/or services that change, augment, enhance or upgrade the current Websites and/or the Services will be subject to this Agreement.\n4. General Registration Requirements. Visitors are currently permitted to view only limited portions of the Websites prior to deciding whether to become a Registered User. Full access to the Websites and the Services is available only to Registered Users and, if a subscription is required, then only to Registered Users who are also paid subscribers. If you wish to become a Registered User, you must register on our Websites, you must complete the registration procedures displayed on the registration page(s) of the Websites and, where applicable, pay the required subscription fee. Some aspects of the Websites and the Services are available to all Registered Users, and some are available only to Registered Users who have paid the required subscription fee and/or other charges, all of which are posted at the Websites.\n5. Age Requirements for Access and Use of the Websites. By accessing and using the Websites, you acknowledge and agree that you are representing to us that you are over the age of 18 and you are of legal age to form a legally binding contract, and you are not a person barred from purchasing or receiving products and services, under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. Registration, subscription, access to and use of the Websites and the Services are not available to users under the age of 18 and are void where prohibited by applicable law.\n6. Requirements for Becoming a Registered User. By completing the registration procedures displayed on the registration page(s) of the Websites, you acknowledge and agree that (a) you are representing to us that you are providing true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form available on our Websites (the \"Registration Data\"), and (b) you are obliged to maintain and promptly update your Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future access to and/or use of the Websites and the Services (or any portion thereof).\n7. Children. Due to the nature of the Internet, we cannot prohibit minors from visiting our Websites. However, our Websites are not directed toward children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 through the Websites. If you believe that a child has provided information to us through the Websites, please contact us by email at info@Gaia.com or by writing us at Gaia, Inc., 833 W. South Boulder Road, Louisville, Colorado 80027, Attn.: Mai Arnold. We will use our best efforts to remove all of the information provided by the child from our system. (See our Privacy Policy set forth below for additional information about Children’s Online Privacy Protection Policy.)\n8. Member Account, Password and Security. As a Registered User, you are required to choose a password, provide your date of birth, and provide your email address, and you may be asked for additional information regarding your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of the password and all other account information, and you are fully responsible and liable for all access to and use of the Websites and the Services that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify us by e-mail to info@Gaia.com of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you log out from your account at the end of each session. Gaia will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section.\n9. Preservation and Disclosure of Account Information and User Content. You acknowledge and agree that Gaia may access, preserve and disclose your account information and User Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce this Agreement; (c) respond to claims that any Site Content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Gaia, the other users of the Websites and Services, and the public. However, under no other circumstances will Gaia intentionally disclose your account information to any third party except as otherwise provided in our Privacy Policy, which is set forth below.\n10. Security Components. You acknowledge and agree that the Websites and the Services, and the software embodied within the Websites and the Services, may include security components that permit digital materials to be accessed, used, and protected, and that use of these security components is subject to usage rules set by Gaia and/or content providers who provide content to Gaia. You may not attempt to override or circumvent any such security components and usage rules embedded in the Websites and the Services.\n11. Subscription Fees and Payment. Access to and use of the Services is subject to a subscription fee (\"Fee\"). The Fee is payable in U.S. dollars. You will be required to provide your credit card number and other information at the time of your initial registration. Your credit card will automatically be charged at the time of your subscription or the end of your free trial, and regularly thereafter based on the terms of your subscription, and you hereby authorize Gaia to charge your credit card for the then-applicable subscription fee. The Fee is non-refundable except as provided in Section 26 below (“Term and Termination”). Gaia reserves the right to change or modify the Fee or payment schedule (including, without limitation, increasing prices and charging a fee for upgrades) at any time. Gaia will use its reasonable best efforts to provide you with reasonable notice prior to making any fee changes or modifications.\nIf Gaia is for any reason unable to effect automatic payment via your credit card, Gaia will attempt to notify you via email and your account will be disabled until payment is received. You are responsible for notifying Gaia of any changes to your credit card information and to update your information if your credit card has expired. Gaia may suspend, terminate and/or otherwise interrupt your access to the Services if you fail to so notify Gaia.\nAll Fees are exclusive of all excise, sales, use, transfer and other taxes and duties imposed with respect to the Services by any federal, state, municipal or other governmental authority, all of which taxes you are required to pay except for taxes based on Gaia’s net income. You are responsible for obtaining and providing to Gaia any certificate of exemption or similar document required to exempt any transaction from sales, use or similar tax liability.\nYou agree to pay your account balance on time. You are responsible and liable for any costs and expenses, including attorney and collection fees, that Gaia may incur in its efforts to collect any remaining balances due from you. This paragraph will in no way limit any other remedies available to Gaia. You are required to notify us of any billing problems or discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card account statement by sending a written notice to info@Gaia.com. If you do not so notify us within the time allowed, you waive any right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.\n12a. Content. The content available at the Websites and the Services generally consists of (a) content owned by Gaia, including but not limited to the trademarks, trade dress and “look and feel” of the Websites and content created and/or acquired and owned by Gaia (“Gaia Content”), (b) content owned by third parties and licensed to Gaia for specified uses on the Websites and the Services (“Third-Party Content”), and (c) content that may be posted and/or otherwise uploaded to the Websites and/or the Services by you (“User Content”). As between you and other Registered Users, however, the content posted by other Registered Users is considered to be “Third-Party Content.” All of the foregoing are collectively referred to as “Site Content.”\n12b. Geographic Limitations. Due to certain licensing restrictions placed on our titles, some content may not be available in your geographic location, and therefore, cannot be viewed. If at any time you feel this inhibits your experience upon purchasing a Gaia TV subscription, please contact our customer service department and we will work with you in order to remedy the situation. You can reach customer service by email at info@Gaia.com , or by phone at 866-284-8058.\n13. Ownership of Content. Gaia does not claim ownership rights in any User Content that you post on the Websites or otherwise make available through the Services. Subject to the non-exclusive license contained in Section 14 below (“License to Your Content”), as between Gaia and you, you will retain all intellectual property rights that you may have in any User Content that originates with you.\n14. License to Your Content. In order to be able to offer you the use of our Websites and the Services pursuant to this Agreement, you are required to grant a license to Gaia to use and distribute your User Content. This enables us to permit other Visitors and Registered Users to view and share your User Content, and to display your User Content in other places within the Websites. Accordingly, by posting, displaying, publishing, transmitting, or otherwise making available (individually and collectively, \"posting\") any User Content on or through our Websites or the Services, you hereby grant to Gaia a non-exclusive (meaning you can license the User Content to other parties as well), fully-paid, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense) to use, copy, modify, adapt, translate, create derivative works, publicly perform, publicly display, store, reproduce, transmit, distribute, and otherwise make available such User Content on and through the Websites and/or the Services, in print, or in any other format or media now known or hereafter invented, without any obligation of notification, compensation, attribution or consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not use your User Content to create commercial products such as books. For purposes of this section, “commercial products” does not include use on the Websites and the Services and/or the advertising, publicity, promotional and marketing materials for the Websites and the Services in any and all formats and media now known or hereafter invented. If you wish to remove any User Content from the Websites and/or the Services, the decision will be made by Gaia alone in its sole and absolute discretion, and our decision may depend on the type of User Content, the location and manner of posting, and other factors. You may contact us at info@Gaia.comto request the removal of certain User Content you have posted, but Gaia (i) has no obligation to remove any such User Content, (ii) may choose whether or not to do so in its sole discretion, and (iii) makes no guarantee as to the complete deletion of any such User Content and copies thereof. In any case, a back-up or residual copy of any User Content posted by you may remain on Gaia’s servers after the User Content appears to have been removed from the Websites and/or the Services, and Gaia retains all rights granted in this section to all such remaining copies. You represent and warrant that: (i) you own all right, title and interest in all User Content posted by you on or through our Websites or the Services, or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this section, and (ii) the posting of your User Content on or through the Websites and/or the Services does not require the knowledge or consent of any third party and does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, contract rights, confidentiality, or any other rights of any third party.\n15. Prohibited Conduct. The Websites and the Services may include features that permit you to post User Content, which includes and applies to (but is not limited to) content of your own, comments on the User Content posted by other Registered Users, and communications with other Registered Users.

In the spirit of community, we strive to maintain tolerance, equality and respect. The Internet has opened up a world of opportunity that humanity has never seen before. However, the Internet also gives people the means to insult or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while you’re on Gaia, you respect the people you encounter, as well as their opinions. You’re free to disagree, state your own opinion and provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. Please respect other members’ beliefs, and consider your impact on others when making your contribution. If you can’t conduct yourself in a respectful manner, we reserve the right to remove comments. In extreme cases, we reserve the right to disable the ability to comment.\nWe understand that many of our topics are controversial, and we fully support debate.

I’ve never experienced such a horrible player in all my life. You charge a hefty amount, performance should be better, and I’m sure the high cost is partly because not many people will subscribe to this content so I’m ok with supporting you as you grow your subscriptions however the irony is I watch this for my spiritual side and the amount of frustrations I get trying to be peaceful is anything but.

I am a follower of David Wilcock and I had heard through the grapevine that his original interviews with Corey Goode were on this platform. This is actually what led me to signup for the trial, only to find out that the interviews and other content had been pulled due to issues between Gaia and Corey. Needless to say I was disappointed, I understand that these things happen, but this is the reason for the 4 star review. \n  That being said I am pleased with the amount of content on this platform, the ad free nature, and how a lot of shows are on a weekly schedule.

Even to this day still no English subtitle option. But the main reason for this low review is because for 3 months this app has been freezing as soon as I click on any content. Whether it’s an episode or my profile, the app freezes as soon as I click something on the main screen.

I’ve been using it for a couple of months now, and with the App Store having an article on some other yoga apps, I tried them out a bit.\n\nWhat I don’t like about Gaia is the cost—$99 on the year plan, or $12 per month if I don’t prepay a year. I think most of the other apps are a bit less, but they seem to offer so much less. I have an excellent yoga place nearby, but its schedule and mine don’t often agree, it’s definitely more expensive than Gaia, and I don’t have the option of short classes. \n\nWhat I do like is the quality of the classes and instructors, the variety of what’s offered, the reliable way I can stream videos on my iPad (or to my Apple TV) for me to practice.\n\nMy own peculiarities also influence this—I’m not going to go out and do yoga for 90 minutes. Being able to locate videos that are 15-20 minutes fits well with my attention and energy span. \n\nIn addition, I like to vary what I do. I think I’m fine doing my own meditation, but there are good videos for that. But I can change up between yoga and Tai Chi or whatever and feel I can do what my body needs.
