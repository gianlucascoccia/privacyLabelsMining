It's intuitive, convenient, and high-quality.”\n- Rebecca Lovell: Lead Vocals, Electric Guitar, Acoustic Guitar, Mandolin, Piano for Larkin Poe\n\n(Read more at capoapp.com/testimonials)\n\n*** HEAR THE SONG ***\nSlow down playback, scrub to hear specific notes, and easily create regions that loop as you learn to play the tricky parts.

Change, add, or remove the detected chords easily with a few taps as you identify alternate chords and voicings. Use Capo's structure song view to edit Capo's beat grid for songs with changing, or uncommon time signatures.\n\n*** PAUSE THE SESSION (PRO) ***\nWith an active subscription, Capo saves the loop regions you set, chord changes, and even the playback position into Projects.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Learn your favorite songs without tabs or sheet music.<br /><br />Whether you play for the world or yourself, all musicians need a good ear for harmony, melody, and rhythm. Using the songs in your music collection, Capo guesses the beats, chords, and key of songs to help you break them down to their individual parts. Capo’s unique technology helps you to learn your favorites quickly as you improve your ear along the way.<br /><br />Capo is simple and yet so, so good, even the professionals use it:<br /><br />“Capo is AMAZING!!! Very clutch. Especially when parts are kinda tough in the mix that I can’t make out easily. With other apps you lose quality, this still sounds correct.”<br />- Omar Edwards: Keyboardist/Music Director for Jay-Z, Rihanna, Kanye West, Eminem, and more<br /><br />“When I sat down and started using Capo for the first time, I was amazed at how big a punch this little app packs! It&#39;s intuitive, convenient, and high-quality.”<br />- Rebecca Lovell: Lead Vocals, Electric Guitar, Acoustic Guitar, Mandolin, Piano for Larkin Poe<br /><br />(Read more at capoapp.com/testimonials)<br /><br />*** HEAR THE SONG ***<br />Slow down playback, scrub to hear specific notes, and easily create regions that loop as you learn to play the tricky parts. Use Capo’s tools to isolate specific instruments and even vocals to learn any part of a song. With a couple simple switches, you can focus on the piano or eliminate everything to practice the guitar solo and make transcription easier.<br /><br />*** BREAK IT DOWN ***<br />Capo automatically detects chords, beats, and the key of songs to get you started. Change, add, or remove the detected chords easily with a few taps as you identify alternate chords and voicings. Use Capo&#39;s structure song view to edit Capo&#39;s beat grid for songs with changing, or uncommon time signatures.<br /><br />*** PAUSE THE SESSION (PRO) ***<br />With an active subscription, Capo saves the loop regions you set, chord changes, and even the playback position into Projects. Learn songs at your own pace and revisit them on all your devices using iCloud.<br /><br />*** SO MUCH MORE ***<br />* Transpose songs to different keys<br />* Rename regions to keep organized<br />* Beat detection estimates the tempo and helps snap regions<br />* Edit chords one at a time or globally<br />* Display chord diagrams for Guitar, Banjo, Mandolin, Ukulele, Bass, and now Piano<br />* Rock on southpaws!

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi># New Features<br /><br />## Larger Chord Sizes (iPad Only)<br /><br />On the iPad, you can now choose to display chords with a larger size, making them easier to read in the PRACTICE, TABBING, and CHORDS song views. Note that using Capo in split-screen mode may override your size preference when there isn&#39;t enough room for the larger chords.<br /><br />## Improved In-App Release Notes<br /><br />Thanks to automatic updates, it&#39;s easy to miss out on the details of our ongoing work on Capo between larger releases. To keep you in the loop, we now ship Capo with a more comprehensive set of change history that goes all the way back to the 4.0 release that shipped in late 2019.<br /><br />In future updates to Capo, you&#39;ll be prompted to view these release notes at your convenience, and you can revisit them at any time by selecting the What&#39;s New item in Capo&#39;s top-level settings screen.<br /><br /># Enhancements<br /><br />* Chord boxes for 4- and 5-stringed instruments are now rendered slightly more narrow than the standard 6-string diagrams, which looks a little closer to what folks might expect<br />* Added support for a few chords that have been requested in support: 6add9 (aka 6/9), 7sus2, maj7sus2, 7sus4, and maj7sus4. (Note: You have to specify &quot;6add9&quot; in your chord searches, because &quot;6/9&quot; throws off our support for recognizing inversions. We plan to address this issue soon!)<br /><br /># Bug Fixes<br /><br />* On devices running iOS 12, projects that are received via AirDrop now get copied to the correct location, and no longer get lost when they are closed. (#1842)<br />* When browsing songs in your music library, the title for the back button no longer disappears (#1840)<br />* The control strip no longer displays a placeholder title, or grays out any active PLAYBACK buttons when you tap the folder icon to return to the list of projects. (#1774)<br />* When loading projects that have the playhead positioned near bar numbers greater than 100 in the PRACTICE song view, the bar label is no longer truncated. (#1835)<br />* When switching your instrument to something other than a guitar in standard tuning, Capo now correctly remembers this selection for new projects (#1803)<br />* Capo no longer takes you to an outdated (and apparently broken!) URL on Apple&#39;s servers when you attempt to change or cancel your subscription from the settings screen.</p>

    Best app for learning Jazz solos and Irish tunes from recordings.
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>As an amateur musician, I’ve found Capo to be the best App out there for learning Jazz solos and the intricate ornamentation of Irish tunes.  It provides the cleanest “slow-down” of any of the apps that I’ve tried.  The flexibility of its looping and other playback features makes it much easier to breakdown complicated riffs.  It’s ability to sort out the key and chord changes is truly remarkable; while not infallible, this provides a great starting point for piecing together transcriptions for both chord and melody instruments.  The interface is clean and very well thought out.  This becomes even more obvious the longer you use Capo, since its many capabilities do require some patience to learn/uncover.  I could go on and on. <br /><br />The developers are solid and seem committed to a quality product for the long term, as evidenced by the updates that have been deployed since Capo’s inception (check out their newsletter to get a sense of what their team is about).  At $10 a YEAR, this app is way worth it!  <br /><br />One suggestion.  I’d love there to be an option to have the identified/edited chords automatically sound out, while the original recording rolls along in the background - rather than having to tap each and every chord symbol at the appropriate moments.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’m a composer and love to ad lib compositions, knowing someday day i will have to slog thru the process of listening to chord progressions, analyzing, and writing them down.  ugh! that 90% of Creativity can be a bit of a deterrent. This app is awesome at picking out subtle jazz  chords.  and, if its wrong, the corrections are ez.  I believe it lacks a Lead Sheet option.  If so, that would be great in future versions.  Seems strange, all this advanced technology, and you still have to manually list the chords. Otherwise, the app has a lot options for adjustments to bars, speeds, keys, chord names, etc. that make composition and play along a piece of cake.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Subscription services are lucrative for developers, I guess.  But, for the user I have to decide which apps to subscribe to (if any) and which ones I have to quit using because I can’t afford a subscription for every app I use.  I don’t mind buying an app at all, but having to pay an annual fee is just beyond my means.  And so, I will switch my slow-down app to something else other than Capo because they, at some point, will go to the next version (x.x or Y.x or whatever) and I will be left in the dust having to subscribe again to enjoy some minor tweak of the app.  If every developer ends up with subscription requirements I will just have to abandon my support for them all.  How many $50, $20,  $75, $20, $40, $20, $25 services can you afford?  For me it’s not many and so I just stop using an app that thinks their product should charge me a monthly or annual fee to use it!!  There are plenty of alternatives out there.  The smart developer should appreciate their customer’s PURCHASE of an app, like I did with Capo years ago, to support their further development of the app.  They should take into consideration that users will have to decide which apps to keep or which apps to abandon.  The less used apps I have will be the first to go.  And, Capo falls into that category as there are many alternatives that don’t require a subscription fee after purchase.</p>

New Features\n\n## Larger Chord Sizes (iPad Only)\n\nOn the iPad, you can now choose to display chords with a larger size, making them easier to read in the PRACTICE, TABBING, and CHORDS song views. Note that using Capo in split-screen mode may override your size preference when there isn't enough room for the larger chords.\n\n## Improved In-App Release Notes\n\nThanks to automatic updates, it's easy to miss out on the details of our ongoing work on Capo between larger releases. To keep you in the loop, we now ship Capo with a more comprehensive set of change history that goes all the way back to the 4.0 release that shipped in late 2019.\n\nIn future updates to Capo, you'll be prompted to view these release notes at your convenience, and you can revisit them at any time by selecting the What's New item in Capo's top-level settings screen.\n\n# Enhancements\n\n* Chord boxes for 4- and 5-stringed instruments are now rendered slightly more narrow than the standard 6-string diagrams, which looks a little closer to what folks might expect\n* Added support for a few chords that have been requested in support: 6add9 (aka 6/9), 7sus2, maj7sus2, 7sus4, and maj7sus4. (Note: You have to specify \"6add9\" in your chord searches, because \"6/9\" throws off our support for recognizing inversions. We plan to address this issue soon!)\n\n# Bug Fixes\n\n* On devices running iOS 12, projects that are received via AirDrop now get copied to the correct location, and no longer get lost when they are closed. (#1842)\n* When browsing songs in your music library, the title for the back button no longer disappears (#1840)\n* The control strip no longer displays a placeholder title, or grays out any active PLAYBACK buttons when you tap the folder icon to return to the list of projects. (#1774)\n* When loading projects that have the playhead positioned near bar numbers greater than 100 in the PRACTICE song view, the bar label is no longer truncated. (#1835)\n* When switching your instrument to something other than a guitar in standard tuning, Capo now correctly remembers this selection for new projects (#1803)\n* Capo no longer takes you to an outdated (and apparently broken!) URL on Apple's servers when you attempt to change or cancel your subscription from the settings screen.","releaseDate":"2021-11-04"},{"versionDisplay":"4.2","releaseNotes":"WHAT'S NEW\n\n* You can now export slowed, transposed, pitch-adjusted, and isolated audio from Capo, just like you can on the Mac! You can long-press on a region to export the audio in that range, or you can export modified audio for the whole song from the new menu located at the top-right of the in-song view.\n\nENHANCEMENTS\n\n* We rearranged the header of Capo's in-song view so that it now shows the currently selected song view front \u0026 center. Tapping on this new header will now let you switch the current song view.\n* The User Guide is now also located in the new menu found at the top right corner of the in-song view, so you no longer have to leave your projects to access it.\n\nWe love hearing from our customers, so please leave a review on the App Store to share your positive experiences with others, or send us a support email if you have any questions for us.

Mark the Verse, Chorus, A Section, B Section, or use whatever names you choose! You can also apply colors to the sections to help you identify similar ones.\n\nMany users will be excited to learn that this all-new song view _also_ allows you to edit Capo's beat grid that's used to power Capo's snapping and metronome features. By clicking along with the beat to mark the start of each bar, you can replace Capo's detected beats with your own. You can also change the number of beats in specific bars when you're working with songs that have mixed time signatures, and make fine adjustments to improve precision.\n\n\nChords Song View (Subscription Only, iOS 14+)\n\nAn all-new, vertically-scrolling look at the chords in your song displays more chords on screen at the same time. It also uses the sections you define in the Structure song view to group the chords according to the section they belong in.\n\nThis is a massive improvement for chord-oriented musicians that are looking to analyze a song's overall harmony, or those that want a better view of what's coming ahead.\n\n\nTrial Mode (Paid, Non-Subscribers)\n\nIf you are a paid user that has not yet subscribed to Capo Pro, you can try the new, subscription-only features as many times as you'd like, for as long as you'd like! Just select one of the song views that are marked TRIAL, and Capo will let you play with the feature with only one catch—your edits to the project will no longer be saved.\n\nDon't see anything worth paying for? No problem! Close the project, and you'll be back to using Capo as usual. We will keep trying to earn your subscription in future releases, and hope you enjoy the massive improvements to the chord detection engine!\n\n\nImproved Free Edition\n\nThe free version of Capo no longer has a playback timer! You now have full access to Capo's full feature set, but Capo will not save any of your edits to Projects without an active subscription.\n\nThis change results in a more useful product for a wider audience. Teachers, be sure to tell all your students!\n\n\nENHANCEMENTS\n\n* We modified the Simple Piano chord display to make it easier to distinguish the bass note from the others.\n* You can now disable the system-wide display sleep timer from the Settings screen.\n* The Control Strip and play/pause buttons are now easier to tap.\n* Long pressing the time (or bar-beat) indicator in the HUD will reveal the new Go To Time (or Bar-Beat) feature that lets you seek to a specific location in the song.\n* It's now possible to quickly toggle the metronome by long-pressing its icon in the PLAYBACK control strip.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n* Capo no longer crashes in the chord chooser when searching for chord inversions\n* We addressed a handful of crashes that were submitted by users since the last release.

This work should improve the overall accuracy of Capo’s results, and it paves the way for some features that we plan to add in the coming months.\n\nTo help celebrate these improvements, we’ve expanded the trial to allow access to the chord detection results and increased the playback timer to 60 seconds!\n\nNote: If you’re running an older device, you may notice that it now takes longer to process songs when they are first imported—Capo’s doing a *lot* more detailed analysis than before, so this is to be expected.

Tapping the Control Strip Selector beside the time display lets you switch sets, and a long press reveals a menu to switch between sets quickly. This new design allows us to keep extending Capo touch with even more features, so we're really excited to finally ship it!\n\n• We've added the Transcription Playhead that we first introduced in Capo on macOS. The Transcription Playhead allows you to lock the playhead into position so that every time you press Play, the song starts from the same point. This is very handy when you are listening carefully and want to hear a single note, chord, or riff repeatedly while you're trying to identify what note(s) to play.\n\n• The new Mixer allows you to set the playback volume in Capo touch independently from the metronome and the sound of chords when they're tapped. This feature is helpful when the metronome is difficult to hear over an especially loud song, or if you'd like to play Capo's audio alongside your favorite guitar amp simulation apps.\n\n• You can now adjust the playback pitch of a song using a separate slider that's dedicated to this purpose. Adjustments can be made between -100 and +100 cents, which is equivalent to a semitone in either direction. We know it took a very long to introduce this feature, but the Control Strip made it possible to do it *properly*!\n\nNew Subscriber-Only Features:\n\n• None! The new features in this release are available to all our existing customers, so enjoy!\n\nEnhancements:\n\n• Region looping is now much easier to use! Similar to the macOS version of Capo, looping a region is now enabled by simply selecting it. The play button will change to indicate that Capo touch will loop the selected region, and tapping it starts your loop immediately!\n\n• We added controls for Regions and Chords that allow you to move around the song using a left and right arrow to quickly move around the entries stored in your Project. You'll find these in the respective sets of controls in the Control Strip.\n\n• While working on some future improvements, we spent some quality time with the isolation engine and tweaked our approach a little bit to improve the sound quality of the effect. Let us know what you think!\n\nBug Fixes:\n\n• The \"Open In\" functionality in iOS 10.3 has been restored for all you folks that like to import audio files from other apps (such as Mail, Dropbox, etc.) We apologize for any trouble that we caused with this bug in the last update!\n\n• We addressed an issue that led to the isolation's power display to appear flipped, causing energy on the right side to appear on the left, and vice versa. This is now resolved, and we regret any error/confusion that was caused.\n\n• The top crashes were addressed, and we appreciate all your submissions and feedback. Keep it coming so we can keep making the app better with each new update!\n\nPlease leave us a review on the App Store to let us know how you're enjoying Capo touch and the new update.

It provides the cleanest “slow-down” of any of the apps that I’ve tried.  The flexibility of its looping and other playback features makes it much easier to breakdown complicated riffs.  It’s ability to sort out the key and chord changes is truly remarkable; while not infallible, this provides a great starting point for piecing together transcriptions for both chord and melody instruments.  The interface is clean and very well thought out.  This becomes even more obvious the longer you use Capo, since its many capabilities do require some patience to learn/uncover.  I could go on and on. \n\nThe developers are solid and seem committed to a quality product for the long term, as evidenced by the updates that have been deployed since Capo’s inception (check out their newsletter to get a sense of what their team is about).  At $10 a YEAR, this app is way worth it!  \n\nOne suggestion.  I’d love there to be an option to have the identified/edited chords automatically sound out, while the original recording rolls along in the background - rather than having to tap each and every chord symbol at the appropriate moments.","title":"Best app for learning Jazz solos and Irish tunes from recordings.","userName":"IceKole"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3321117622","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-10-20T00:41:20Z","developerResponse":{"id":5944576,"body":"Thanks so much for this review of Capo.

But, for the user I have to decide which apps to subscribe to (if any) and which ones I have to quit using because I can’t afford a subscription for every app I use.  I don’t mind buying an app at all, but having to pay an annual fee is just beyond my means.  And so, I will switch my slow-down app to something else other than Capo because they, at some point, will go to the next version (x.x or Y.x or whatever) and I will be left in the dust having to subscribe again to enjoy some minor tweak of the app.  If every developer ends up with subscription requirements I will just have to abandon my support for them all.  How many $50, $20,  $75, $20, $40, $20, $25 services can you afford?  For me it’s not many and so I just stop using an app that thinks their product should charge me a monthly or annual fee to use it!!  There are plenty of alternatives out there.  The smart developer should appreciate their customer’s PURCHASE of an app, like I did with Capo years ago, to support their further development of the app.  They should take into consideration that users will have to decide which apps to keep or which apps to abandon.  The less used apps I have will be the first to go.  And, Capo falls into that category as there are many alternatives that don’t require a subscription fee after purchase.","title":"Ihopeyougobroke","userName":"Wdav"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3247808887","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-09-30T13:31:31Z","developerResponse":{"id":5944868,"body":"Wow!

I think it’s one of the better tools for transcription.  But I have since encountered a bug in the app that prevents me from using it in any meaningful way.  This is why I have rated it 1 star.\n\nHere’s my issue: \nI have a Capo touch Pro subscription, but the Capo app will only let me play a 60-second trial of the song I’m trying to transcribe.  In the song playback mode it thinks I am a trial user.  The app tells me that I have a current subscription—when I go to “Choose a Plan” under Settings it says as much—but it won’t let me listen to a song for more than 60 seconds.  This makes the app unusable.  \n\nI contacted Capo support, who was initially quite responsive but weeks later they still have not fixed the problem.  I like this app, but I am very disappointed that I have spent money on an annual subscription that is currently getting wasted as time goes by where I cannot use it.  I hope they fix the problem soon so I can use the remainder of my annual subscription.","title":"App Doesn’t Recognize Subscription","userName":"Roshi_Thel"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6527755118","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-12T15:39:51Z","rating":5,"review":"As a music professor, professional musician and tutor, this software has exceeded any other form of ear training and transcription tool out there!

If you'd like to read more about the development of this new technology, visit our blog at supermegaultragroovy.com.\n\n\nSong Views (iOS 14+)\n\nFollowing Capo's counterpart on macOS, Capo touch offers alternate views of your song that are tailored to specific tasks while you're learning. You can switch between the available song views by tapping the new button that appears at the top-right of the project view.\n\n\nStructure Song View (Subscription Only, iOS 14+)\n\nYou can now see and mark up your songs at a high level—bar by bar—to define the sections of the song. Mark the Verse, Chorus, A Section, B Section, or use whatever names you choose! You can also apply colors to the sections to help you identify similar ones.\n\nMany users will be excited to learn that this all-new song view _also_ allows you to edit Capo's beat grid that's used to power Capo's snapping and metronome features. By clicking along with the beat to mark the start of each bar, you can replace Capo's detected beats with your own. You can also change the number of beats in specific bars when you're working with songs that have mixed time signatures, and make fine adjustments to improve precision.\n\n\nChords Song View (Subscription Only, iOS 14+)\n\nAn all-new, vertically-scrolling look at the chords in your song displays more chords on screen at the same time. It also uses the sections you define in the Structure song view to group the chords according to the section they belong in.\n\nThis is a massive improvement for chord-oriented musicians that are looking to analyze a song's overall harmony, or those that want a better view of what's coming ahead.\n\n\nTrial Mode (Paid, Non-Subscribers)\n\nIf you are a paid user that has not yet subscribed to Capo Pro, you can try the new, subscription-only features as many times as you'd like, for as long as you'd like! Just select one of the song views that are marked TRIAL, and Capo will let you play with the feature with only one catch—your edits to the project will no longer be saved.\n\nDon't see anything worth paying for? No problem! Close the project, and you'll be back to using Capo as usual. We will keep trying to earn your subscription in future releases, and hope you enjoy the massive improvements to the chord detection engine!\n\n\nImproved Free Edition\n\nThe free version of Capo no longer has a playback timer! You now have full access to Capo's full feature set, but Capo will not save any of your edits to Projects without an active subscription.\n\nThis change results in a more useful product for a wider audience. Teachers, be sure to tell all your students!\n\n\nENHANCEMENTS\n\n* We modified the Simple Piano chord display to make it easier to distinguish the bass note from the others.\n* You can now disable the system-wide display sleep timer from the Settings screen.\n* The Control Strip and play/pause buttons are now easier to tap.\n* Long pressing the time (or bar-beat) indicator in the HUD will reveal the new Go To Time (or Bar-Beat) feature that lets you seek to a specific location in the song.\n* It's now possible to quickly toggle the metronome by long-pressing its icon in the PLAYBACK control strip.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n* Capo no longer crashes in the chord chooser when searching for chord inversions\n* We addressed a handful of crashes that were submitted by users since the last release.

Tapping the Control Strip Selector beside the time display lets you switch sets, and a long press reveals a menu to switch between sets quickly. This new design allows us to keep extending Capo touch with even more features, so we're really excited to finally ship it!\n\n• We've added the Transcription Playhead that we first introduced in Capo on macOS. The Transcription Playhead allows you to lock the playhead into position so that every time you press Play, the song starts from the same point. This is very handy when you are listening carefully and want to hear a single note, chord, or riff repeatedly while you're trying to identify what note(s) to play.\n\n• The new Mixer allows you to set the playback volume in Capo touch independently from the metronome and the sound of chords when they're tapped. This feature is helpful when the metronome is difficult to hear over an especially loud song, or if you'd like to play Capo's audio alongside your favorite guitar amp simulation apps.\n\n• You can now adjust the playback pitch of a song using a separate slider that's dedicated to this purpose. Adjustments can be made between -100 and +100 cents, which is equivalent to a semitone in either direction. We know it took a very long to introduce this feature, but the Control Strip made it possible to do it *properly*!\n\nNew Subscriber-Only Features:\n\n• None! The new features in this release are available to all our existing customers, so enjoy!\n\nEnhancements:\n\n• Region looping is now much easier to use! Similar to the macOS version of Capo, looping a region is now enabled by simply selecting it. The play button will change to indicate that Capo touch will loop the selected region, and tapping it starts your loop immediately!\n\n• We added controls for Regions and Chords that allow you to move around the song using a left and right arrow to quickly move around the entries stored in your Project. You'll find these in the respective sets of controls in the Control Strip.\n\n• While working on some future improvements, we spent some quality time with the isolation engine and tweaked our approach a little bit to improve the sound quality of the effect. Let us know what you think!\n\nBug Fixes:\n\n• The \"Open In\" functionality in iOS 10.3 has been restored for all you folks that like to import audio files from other apps (such as Mail, Dropbox, etc.) We apologize for any trouble that we caused with this bug in the last update!\n\n• We addressed an issue that led to the isolation's power display to appear flipped, causing energy on the right side to appear on the left, and vice versa. This is now resolved, and we regret any error/confusion that was caused.\n\n• The top crashes were addressed, and we appreciate all your submissions and feedback. Keep it coming so we can keep making the app better with each new update!\n\nPlease leave us a review on the App Store to let us know how you're enjoying Capo touch and the new update.
