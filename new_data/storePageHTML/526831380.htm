        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Named by Time.com&#39;s @Techland as one of the best weather apps for your iPhone and Apple Watch.<br /><br />Severe weather alerts for your exact location. Storm Shield gives you storm-based alerts for tornado, hurricane, flood, thunderstorm, winter storms and other life-threatening weather events via voice and push notification.<br /><br />Storm-based alerts help reduce false alarms by alerting you to severe weather based on your exact location within a county. County-based alerts can result in false alarms, warning you when your location in the county is not within the threatened area.<br /><br /><br />What people are saying:<br />• Storm Shield &quot;alerted our family of the Broken Arrow, OK tornado, faster than the TV and tornado sirens.&quot; - Robyn<br /><br />• &quot;I was in Oklahoma City during the tornado... we were right in its path.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Just got this but so far so good. Kept us up to date on the latest winter storms. Hopefully works as good on summer storms. Seems to use a lot of battery. Would like to see road emergency levels if possible. Since last update it&#39;s terrible. Radar takes forever to load if it ever does. Right now its a waste of money. Thinking of finding something else. Will not advise friends and family to get this. Last update is useless. I live in a flood area and no longer receive audible warnings. As long as i am awake i know water is rising. If in bed guess i will just drown. Keep up the great updates and no one will be alive to buy your app. Why would i want a weather app that doesn&#39;t notify me. Hope a tornado warning is never issued at night. Think about us and not your pocket. Ok got notifications back and then another update In May--- lost notifications AGAIN. What gives? Really starting to rethink this app AGAIN.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>UPDATE 5/29/18 - If you are experiencing issues with notifications, please provide more detail by filing a Support ticket from within your Storm Shield App, which provides us with additional diagnostic data, and we’ll be happy to look into it.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/25/18 - Version 4.4 released: UPDATE #1: New Weather Alerts improvements: Thanks to your feedback from the initial version 4 release, Storm Shield App now provides over 160 weather alert types (instead of 45) for which you can choose to receive a push notification. This is even more alert types than the original Storm Shield App version 3&#39;s push notifications (which had 110). To choose which alert types you want to enable or disable, on the Map screen tap Settings (the gear icon), then Manage Weather Alerts. As always, when you receive a push notification from Storm Shield App, you will hear an audio notification that says: &quot;Beep! Beep! Beep! The National Weather Service has issued a &#39;Name of Alert&#39;.&quot; UPDATE #2) New Lightning Alerts improvement: In Settings, you can now enable and disable Lightning push notifications with an on/off switch. Also, when you have Lightning Alerts enabled, a new slider lets you adjust the notification sensitivity between 1 and 10 miles. Adjust this by 1-mile increments to be notified of lightning strikes within X miles. We hope you enjoy these latest improvements!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have loved this app for a little over 2 years now I believe. So much so that when our friends from California moved here to Tennessee with no experience in severe weather and were nervous about the weather, I recommended it to them to keep them up to date on watches and warnings and give them a heads up if there was a tornado warning in the middle of the night to get to the basement. Got us all set up with locations picked, alerts turned on and everything and felt good about it, until last night when tornadoes went through the area and there was not ONE alert that popped up for any of us other than the tornado watch that came through like 3 hours after it was issued. We never got any alert for the severe thunderstorm warning or the special weather statement that came and went. And thank the good Lord the radar still worked because I had to watch it all night and just happened to notice the red box pop up when the tornado warning was issued right over their location, and was able to call and tell them to get them and their kids downstairs in time for their area to get hit. People’s roofs were ripped off within a mile or two of their home and they would have had no idea they were even in danger if they’d just trusted this app:( makes me sad because it’s always worked for me and my family in the past and I trusted it too, but none of us (3-4 phones) got any alerts when it really mattered despite double and triple checking all our settings were correct.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Thank you for your comments! We&#39;re aware that some Apple iPhone or iPad users may have received weather alerts that were delayed in recent severe weather events. We&#39;re working with our weather alert provider to investigate this and identify any potential causes. Apple&#39;s push notification service, which Storm Shield iOS relies on for delivery of its severe weather alerts, is a &quot;best-effort&quot; service, meaning that Apple makes its best effort to deliver all notifications for iOS devices, but cannot guarantee delivery. To be clear, we&#39;re not pointing the finger at Apple&#39;s push notification service (we&#39;re still investigating); rather, just trying to explain how the push notification process works. Please rest assured that we&#39;re working diligently with our weather alerting partner to ensure that everything that we can control is functioning properly, so that future weather alerts will not be delayed. We understand how important it is that alerting works properly, so if you continue to experience missed or late alerts, please reach back out to us. <br /><br />Your experience also helps reinforce the importance of having multiple alerting sources, as nothing in technology is ever 100% foolproof (although we and our weather technology partner providers strive for that as much as we possibly can). While this experience you had is the exception rather than the rule, we&#39;re confident that you&#39;ll see this from our past app reviews over the years. Thank you again for helping us strive to be even better!</p>

    Adding a star for customer support

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Updating my previous review and adding a star for great customer support! Within hours, the developers responded directly to my review, noting a temporary server glitch that prevented me from adding new locations. Works now! It’s a little cumbersome on the search function and only supports U.S., but once the location is set, the swipe-between-locations feature in the main interface is easy to use. I figure the other issue re: dark vs. light background is related to the settings on each of my devices. No big deal. <br /><br />I may keep Storm Shield for local weather monitoring and still stick with my old standby Storm Radar for a global view and peppier radar. Intellicast was the best weather app hands-down, but since its demise, no one has been able to match it.<br /><br />Previously: I’m on the fence trying to decide between weather apps for my iPhone and iPad. Storm Shield is good, but on the iPad I keep getting an error message when I try to add locations. The darker radar background is preferred on the iPad, but I’ve been unable to replicate it on my iPhone. The simple interface, one click between radar and detailed forecast info, is easy to navigate — a big plus!</p>

A few under-the-hood maintenance items are included in this release.","releaseDate":"2021-06-01"},{"versionDisplay":"4.14","releaseNotes":"Version 4.14\n\nAPP IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n• NEW! We added a new feature in Settings \u003e Advanced \u003e called 'Opening Weather Alert Notifications'. Now, when you tap a weather alert notification on your iOS device, you can choose to 'Show Map Screen', which opens the app on the Map screen and displays the location for which the alert was about (this is the default app behavior), or you can 'Show Alert Detail Screen', which opens the app and takes you straight to the Alert Detail screen so you can read or listen to the full details for the alert that you just received.\n\n• We fixed a bug on the Hurricane Tracks layer where '???' sometimes appeared for one of the data values when viewing a storm's detailed information.\n\n• Additional under-the-hood maintenance items are included in this release.\n","releaseDate":"2020-11-30"},{"versionDisplay":"4.13","releaseNotes":"Version 4.13\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n\n• We fixed a bug that caused the Lightning Alerts on/off switch to turn off inadvertently for a small group of users when the app was placed in the background and then opened again.\n\n• Additional under-the-hood maintenance items are included in this release.\n","releaseDate":"2020-09-14"},{"versionDisplay":"4.12","releaseNotes":"Version 4.12\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n• We fixed a map rendering bug that caused the map pins to appear to move away from their fixed locations on the map as you zoomed the map out to a broader regional or national map view.\n\n• We fixed a bug that caused the detailed storm information for an active hurricane or tropical storm to not display when you tapped one of the storm's past or forecasted plot points on the map.\n\n• We fixed a bug that would intermittently cause the map view to default to Omaha, Nebraska when you launched the app.","releaseDate":"2020-05-15"},{"versionDisplay":"4.11","releaseNotes":"Version 4.11\n\nAPP IMPROVEMENTS:\n• A new map kit allows for new weather imagery layers that did not exist in version 4.10 and below. You'll notice the base map itself now looks a little different because of this map kit change.\n\nThis new map kit brings the following NEW features:\n\nDARK MODE\n• Storm Shield App now supports iOS 13's Dark Mode. To enable Dark Mode in Storm Shield App, set your iOS device to 'Dark' in your iOS 'Settings' \u003e 'Display \u0026 Brightness'.\n\n\nSEE SEVERE WEATHER ALERTS WHILE RADAR IS ANIMATING\n• The new map kit allows the Radar and the weather alert polygons to display on the map together while the Radar is animating. In previous versions of the app, the alert polygons would disappear when you started the Radar animation.\n\n\nIMPROVED IMAGERY TO THESE EXISTING PAST WEATHER LAYERS:\n• Radar\n• Clouds\n• Clouds \u0026 Radar together\n• Temperatures Map\n• Water Temps Map\n• Wind Speeds Map\n• Road Weather Map\n\n\nNEW MAP LAYERS\n• The new map kit adds a new 'Snow Fall' map layer, which replaced the 'Snow Cover' map layer from version 4.10 and below. The 'Snow Cover' layer from the previous app version's map kit depicted the amount of snow on the ground at a given time from all previous accumulations (i.e. snow pack). Conversely, the new 'Snow Fall' layer in the v4.11's map kit update depicts the amount of snow that has fallen in the last 24 hours, which is a better representation of recent snowfall, but does not account for snowfall that occurred more than 24 hours ago.\n\n• The new map kit adds a new 'Current Conditions' map layer under the 'Severe Weather Overlays' menu, to help you better see current conditions across a wide area.\n\n• The new map kit adds a new 'Current Temperatures' map layer under the 'Severe Weather Overlays' menu, to help you better see current temperatures across a wide area.\n\n\nNEW APP LAUNCH PREFERENCE\n• We added a new feature in 'Advanced \u003e Show When App Starts' that lets you choose what location you want to see when you launch Storm Shield: choose to always show 'Your Current Location' (if you've allowed location permission) when you launch the app, or always show 'Your Last Viewed Location' when you launch the app.\n\n\nVIEW SEAMLESS PAST-TO-FUTURE RADAR IMAGERY\n• The new map kit lets you view Past-to-Future Weather imagery seamlessly, without having to switch weather layers (requires an optional in-app purchase to the Premium Weather monthly subscription).\n\n\nFOUR NEW FUTURE IMAGERY MAP LAYERS\n• The new map kit adds 4 brand new Future imagery map layers that did not exist in any prior version of the app (these require an optional in-app purchase to the Premium Weather monthly subscription):\n\n• Future Clouds: See predicted cloud imagery for the next few hours.\n• Future Clouds \u0026 Radar together: See predicted clouds and radar imagery together for the next few hours.\n• Future Water Temps Map: See predicted future water temperatures map.\n• Future Wind Speeds Map: See predicted future wind speeds map.\n\n• NOTE: If you already have a pre-existing active subscription for the optional Premium Weather in-app purchase, all six Future imagery layers will be enabled automatically when you update your app to this version 4.11 release.\n\n• If you do not have an active Premium Weather in-app purchase subscription, or your Premium Weather in-app purchase previously expired, then you will need to purchase the optional Premium Weather in-app subscription to unlock these six Future imagery map layers.\n\n\nIMPROVED IMAGERY TO THESE EXISTING FUTURE IMAGERY LAYERS:\n• Future Radar: See predicted radar imagery for the next few hours.\n• Future Temperature Map: See predicted future temperatures map.\n\n\nOTHER APP CHANGES INCLUDE:\n• We removed the 'Advanced \u003e Weather Layer Imagery Loops' user preference that was in the old v4.10 app, because the new map kit from our weather provider in this version 4.11 app release does not support this capability.\n\n• Additional under-the-hood maintenance items are included in this release.","releaseDate":"2020-04-01"},{"versionDisplay":"4.10","releaseNotes":"Version 4.10\n\nBUG FIXES:\n• We fixed a bug on iPad where the map didn't properly display across the entire screen when iPad was in Landscape View. As a result of this fix, we've expanded the Location Card view (at the bottom of the map screen) to be more helpful and show more hours when iPad is in Landscape view.\n\n• We fixed another bug where the Hurricane Tracks detail screen could not be closed if it displayed a lot of hurricane track data points.\n\n• We fixed a small bug where the app would crash when attempting to Share a map image to the device's Camera Roll.\n\n• We fixed a small bug that caused the app's Notifications permission box to not display correctly when the user wanted to enable Weather Alerts in the app, but the iOS device itself had notifications disabled (in iOS Settings).\n\n• Additional under-the-hood maintenance items are included in this release.","releaseDate":"2018-11-06"},{"versionDisplay":"4.9","releaseNotes":"Version 4.9\n\nAPP IMPROVEMENTS:\n\nTURN SEVERE WEATHER ALERTS ON OR OFF BY LOCATION\n• This was a popular user request! In Settings, tap Manage Locations, then swipe left on a location name to reveal this new option. Note: Storm Shield supports notifications for up to 25 total locations (for example: 1 Current Location plus 24 Saved Locations).\n\nVOICE PLAYBACK OF AN ALERT'S FULL DETAIL TEXT\n• In the app, when a user taps a location's active alert to read its full text, users can tap a new Play/Pause button at the top of the Alert Detail to have Siri read the complete alert text. This feature is also helpful with Accessibility needs for our visually impaired users.\n\nMORE STORM DETAIL FOR HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS\n• With the Hurricane Tracks overlay enabled, Storm Shield now displays this storm detail: storm name; type of storm (i.e. 'Tropical Depression'); direction, speed, and wind speed; past date and time stamps (i.e. '8 hours ago'); and forecasted date and time stamps (i.e. 'in 2 days').\n\nCUSTOMIZE WEATHER IMAGERY DISPLAY FOR SLOW CELLULAR CONNECTIONS\n• A new Advanced setting lets you set the number of looping imagery frames to display for weather layers (such as radar) if you are on a slow cellular connection. Using less frames will help looping layers like radar display faster, but you won't see as much imagery.\n\n\nACCESSIBILITY FIXES:\n• For our visually-impaired users: when inside the app and you tap an active alert to read its full detail, you can now tap the new Play/Pause button at the top of the Alert Detail screen. This gives Voice Over users more control over the voice read-back of an active alert's full detail text.\n\n• When the iOS Accessibility Voice Over ability was on, and there were multiple locations saved in Storm Shield, and those locations had multiple active alerts, a bug caused one location in the app to get its number of alerts confused with the number of active alerts for other locations in the app. This bug has now been squashed.\n\n• When the iOS Accessibility Voice Over ability was on, and Local Media Provider content appeared in the Location Card Detail screen, a bug caused the 'Live Stream' and 'Full Story' buttons to not be tappable. This bug has now been squashed.\n\n\nOTHER BUG FIXES:\n• We squashed an annoying bug that was causing severe weather notifications to stop working for some users, while these notifications continued to work fine for the majority of users. If your device was affected by this, updating your app and opening this version 4.9 should correct that issue.\n\nIf, after installing and opening this version 4.9 update, you feel you're still not getting weather alert notifications, please submit a Support ticket from within your Storm Shield App, which provides us with additional diagnostic data, and we'll look into it.\n\n• A bug was found in Storm Shield iOS version 4.8 (which was released on July 9, 2018), which caused in-app purchase subscriptions that expired to not actually become disabled correctly in the app for some users. The net result was, some users continued to get access to the premium features for free after the in-app purchase subscription expired. This bug has been corrected in Storm Shield iOS version 4.9.\n\n• A bug was found in Storm Shield, which caused the purchase of an individual in-app subscription feature to inadvertently also unlock the other in-app subscription purchase feature. As an example: if you purchased the individual 'Lightning' feature, you inadvertently also got the separate 'Future Radar' feature for free. This bug has been corrected in Storm Shield iOS version 4.9.\n\n• Additional bug fixes and performance improvements are included in this release.","releaseDate":"2018-09-04"},{"versionDisplay":"4.8","releaseNotes":"Version 4.8\n\nAPP IMPROVEMENTS:\n• NEW! LONG-TAP ON THE MAP:\nYou can now long-tap on the map to get current conditions and weather forecasts for any location in the United States. After dropping a temporary purple pin onto the map, tap the blue 'Info' button to view its current conditions and forecasts. You can also choose to save this location right from the long-tap results display, by tapping the '+' icon in the upper-right corner of the Location Details screen. Long-tap makes it quick and easy to check a location's weather and add a new location to your Saved Locations just by tapping the map.\n\n• 'FUTURE WEATHER' PAID SUBSCRIPTION RENAMED TO 'PREMIUM WEATHER'\nWe renamed the 'Future Weather' paid in-app subscription to 'Premium Weather' to eliminate some confusion caused by the old name. Some users mistakenly thought 'Future Weather' meant they had to pay for Daily and Hourly forecasts, which is not the case. Daily and Hourly forecasts come with your app download at no extra charge.\n\nAs a reminder, the 'Premium Weather' (formerly known as 'Future Weather') paid in-app subscription unlocks these 3 features that are NEW in version 4:\n\n1) Future Radar: See radar into the future (6 hrs on Wi-Fi, 2 hrs on cellular)\n2) Storm Tracks: See how fast storms are moving \u0026 where they're headed\n3) Future Temperature Map: See future temperatures map (12 hrs on Wi-Fi, 5 hrs on cellular)\n\nBUG FIXES:\n• Additional bug fixes and performance improvements are included in this release.","releaseDate":"2018-07-09"},{"versionDisplay":"4.7","releaseNotes":"Version 4.7\n\nAPP IMPROVEMENTS:\n• Widget: Storm Shield App now has a widget for the Today screen on your iOS device! This was a common user request, and we're excited this is now part of the app! Get quick access to active weather alerts, current conditions and a 5-hour forecast for the first location you have in your Storm Shield App. Be sure to enable your widget on your device's Today screen. Storm Shield's widget can also appear on your lock screen for super-quick access if you enabled it.\n\n• 3D Touch: The app's icon is now enabled with 3D Touch, an Apple technology that senses how deeply you press the display in iPhone 6S and later iPhone models. By 3D touching the app icon on your iPhone, you can get quick access to active weather alerts, current conditions and a 5-hour forecast for the first location you have in your Storm Shield App, right from the home screen of your iPhone.\n\n• A new Advanced feature allows you to select your preference to show on the Location Card at the bottom of the map either the 5-hour forecast Conditions or the 5-hour forecast Temperatures. This new preference also takes effect on Storm Shield's new Widget. To set your preference, on the Map screen tap Settings (the gear icon), then Advanced, and under 'Location Cards' select either 'Show Hourly Conditions' or 'Show Hourly Temperatures'. \n\n• Tapping a location pin on the map shows a bubble with a new info button that opens the Location Details screen. (You can still tap the 'More' button on the Location Card at the bottom of the screen to access the same location information.)\n\nBUG FIXES:\n• This includes a patch for the bug fix in version 4.6 that was supposed to clear up duplicate saved locations in the app. Version 4.5 cleared up duplicate current locations, but turns out it did not handle all cases for duplicate saved locations. This version 4.7 should now resolve that for saved locations too. If, after installing version 4.7, your device is still affected by this, please submit a Support ticket from within your Storm Shield App, which provides us with additional diagnostic data, and we’ll look into it.\n\n• Fixed a bug that caused an app crash if you had to delete and then quickly re-install the app (the app could crash if any app settings at the iOS system level were not cleared immediately when the app was deleted, due to some system level app settings that could remain cached for a few extra minutes).\n\n• Additional Accessibility and Voice Over improvements for our visually-impaired users are included in this release.","releaseDate":"2018-05-23"},{"versionDisplay":"4.6","releaseNotes":"Version 4.6\n\n• HOT FIX to ver4.5: Fixes an app crash on startup that only affected older 32-bit devices, such as iPhone 5.

It turns out older 32-bit devices, such as iPhone 5, didn't like the new code.

We made this change because some users were confused as to why the orange temperature on the Location Card (i.e. the 'forecasted temperature for the current hour') didn't match the orange temperature on the Location Details screen (i.e. 'current conditions temperature').\n\n• Accessibility and Voice Over improvements for our visually-impaired users are included in this release.\n\n• Select the text of an active alert's full details.

This is even more alert types than the original Storm Shield App version 3's push notifications (which had 110). To choose which alert types you want to enable or disable, on the Map screen tap Settings (the gear icon), then Manage Weather Alerts. As always, when you receive a push notification from Storm Shield App, you will hear an audio notification that says: \"Beep! Beep! Beep! The National Weather Service has issued a 'Name of Alert'.\" UPDATE #2) New Lightning Alerts improvement: In Settings, you can now enable and disable Lightning push notifications with an on/off switch. Also, when you have Lightning Alerts enabled, a new slider lets you adjust the notification sensitivity between 1 and 10 miles. Adjust this by 1-mile increments to be notified of lightning strikes within X miles.

Hopefully works as good on summer storms. Seems to use a lot of battery. Would like to see road emergency levels if possible. Since last update it's terrible. Radar takes forever to load if it ever does. Right now its a waste of money. Thinking of finding something else. Will not advise friends and family to get this. Last update is useless. I live in a flood area and no longer receive audible warnings. As long as i am awake i know water is rising. If in bed guess i will just drown. Keep up the great updates and no one will be alive to buy your app. Why would i want a weather app that doesn't notify me. Hope a tornado warning is never issued at night. Think about us and not your pocket. Ok got notifications back and then another update In May--- lost notifications AGAIN. What gives? Really starting to rethink this app AGAIN.","title":"Pretty good app.","userName":"Aaaaaaaaaaaamr"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7146984373","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-03-26T14:37:46Z","developerResponse":{"id":21927612,"body":"Thank you for your comments! We're aware that some Apple iPhone or iPad users may have received weather alerts that were delayed in recent severe weather events. We're working with our weather alert provider to investigate this and identify any potential causes. Apple's push notification service, which Storm Shield iOS relies on for delivery of its severe weather alerts, is a \"best-effort\" service, meaning that Apple makes its best effort to deliver all notifications for iOS devices, but cannot guarantee delivery. To be clear, we're not pointing the finger at Apple's push notification service (we're still investigating); rather, just trying to explain how the push notification process works. Please rest assured that we're working diligently with our weather alerting partner to ensure that everything that we can control is functioning properly, so that future weather alerts will not be delayed. We understand how important it is that alerting works properly, so if you continue to experience missed or late alerts, please reach back out to us. \n\nYour experience also helps reinforce the importance of having multiple alerting sources, as nothing in technology is ever 100% foolproof (although we and our weather technology partner providers strive for that as much as we possibly can). While this experience you had is the exception rather than the rule, we're confident that you'll see this from our past app reviews over the years. Thank you again for helping us strive to be even better!","modified":"2021-03-29T13:56:52Z"},"rating":2,"review":"I have loved this app for a little over 2 years now I believe. So much so that when our friends from California moved here to Tennessee with no experience in severe weather and were nervous about the weather, I recommended it to them to keep them up to date on watches and warnings and give them a heads up if there was a tornado warning in the middle of the night to get to the basement. Got us all set up with locations picked, alerts turned on and everything and felt good about it, until last night when tornadoes went through the area and there was not ONE alert that popped up for any of us other than the tornado watch that came through like 3 hours after it was issued. We never got any alert for the severe thunderstorm warning or the special weather statement that came and went. And thank the good Lord the radar still worked because I had to watch it all night and just happened to notice the red box pop up when the tornado warning was issued right over their location, and was able to call and tell them to get them and their kids downstairs in time for their area to get hit. People’s roofs were ripped off within a mile or two of their home and they would have had no idea they were even in danger if they’d just trusted this app:( makes me sad because it’s always worked for me and my family in the past and I trusted it too, but none of us (3-4 phones) got any alerts when it really mattered despite double and triple checking all our settings were correct.","title":"Alerts","userName":"nayala1"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6075154605","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-14T15:25:22Z","developerResponse":{"id":15950455,"body":"We had a temporary server outage with regard to the ability to add locations to the app. This problem started on the evening of June 11, 2020, and was resolved the next morning on June 12, 2020.

Storm Shield is good, but on the iPad I keep getting an error message when I try to add locations.

If you know where to look, the features I liked about previous versions are still there. So I up-rated my review to 4 stars. The problem is that finding the forecast stuff isn’t straightforward in this version. In this version there is a fairly large button with the options “Current” and “Future”. Click on Future and basically what you get is a “Pay Up” message. To get the old forecast features, click on the little, tiny “More” in the bottom right, up comes a screen with current data plus sunrise/sunset. There is nothing to indicate that scrolling down will get you the forecast for the week that you were looking for.  No slide bar shows until you actually start scrolling. \n\nOriginal review - Title: Last update turned a winner into a loser\n\nGreat app but it’s really not free. With the last update it will only show you what’s happening right now. I can open the door for that. To get any forecast data (i.e., what’s going to happen), you have to buy a subscription.

All the other apps that I have do the same thing they give it to you accept with them. This app is very in accurate and also very horrible. It doesn’t tell forecast for nothing.

Just have one flat fee of a few bucks to either upgrade to those features or raise the price of the initial cost of the app by a buck or two. I think the monthly charge to see future radar and lightning strikes is ridiculous. I would love to see future radar (could care less about lightning strikes), but I’m not paying .99 a month for it and I don’t think it’s fair to charge a monthly fee to see that. It doesn’t seem worth $12 a year, but I really would love to just have that feature if I could pay a couple dollars to add it if it’s that important to make a profit off of the future radar feature (lame). \nOtherwise I enjoy the app. Just think the extra subscription is ridiculous.","title":"Subscription features","userName":"kRashkin81107"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3786349523","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-02-18T21:22:42Z","developerResponse":{"id":7370485,"body":"Thanks so much for your kind words and for recommending Storm Shield!

In previous versions of the app, the alert polygons would disappear when you started the Radar animation.\n\n\nIMPROVED IMAGERY TO THESE EXISTING PAST WEATHER LAYERS:\n• Radar\n• Clouds\n• Clouds \u0026 Radar together\n• Temperatures Map\n• Water Temps Map\n• Wind Speeds Map\n• Road Weather Map\n\n\nNEW MAP LAYERS\n• The new map kit adds a new 'Snow Fall' map layer, which replaced the 'Snow Cover' map layer from version 4.10 and below. The 'Snow Cover' layer from the previous app version's map kit depicted the amount of snow on the ground at a given time from all previous accumulations (i.e. snow pack). Conversely, the new 'Snow Fall' layer in the v4.11's map kit update depicts the amount of snow that has fallen in the last 24 hours, which is a better representation of recent snowfall, but does not account for snowfall that occurred more than 24 hours ago.\n\n• The new map kit adds a new 'Current Conditions' map layer under the 'Severe Weather Overlays' menu, to help you better see current conditions across a wide area.\n\n• The new map kit adds a new 'Current Temperatures' map layer under the 'Severe Weather Overlays' menu, to help you better see current temperatures across a wide area.\n\n\nNEW APP LAUNCH PREFERENCE\n• We added a new feature in 'Advanced \u003e Show When App Starts' that lets you choose what location you want to see when you launch Storm Shield: choose to always show 'Your Current Location' (if you've allowed location permission) when you launch the app, or always show 'Your Last Viewed Location' when you launch the app.\n\n\nVIEW SEAMLESS PAST-TO-FUTURE RADAR IMAGERY\n• The new map kit lets you view Past-to-Future Weather imagery seamlessly, without having to switch weather layers (requires an optional in-app purchase to the Premium Weather monthly subscription).\n\n\nFOUR NEW FUTURE IMAGERY MAP LAYERS\n• The new map kit adds 4 brand new Future imagery map layers that did not exist in any prior version of the app (these require an optional in-app purchase to the Premium Weather monthly subscription):\n\n• Future Clouds: See predicted cloud imagery for the next few hours.\n• Future Clouds \u0026 Radar together: See predicted clouds and radar imagery together for the next few hours.\n• Future Water Temps Map: See predicted future water temperatures map.\n• Future Wind Speeds Map: See predicted future wind speeds map.\n\n• NOTE: If you already have a pre-existing active subscription for the optional Premium Weather in-app purchase, all six Future imagery layers will be enabled automatically when you update your app to this version 4.11 release.\n\n• If you do not have an active Premium Weather in-app purchase subscription, or your Premium Weather in-app purchase previously expired, then you will need to purchase the optional Premium Weather in-app subscription to unlock these six Future imagery map layers.\n\n\nIMPROVED IMAGERY TO THESE EXISTING FUTURE IMAGERY LAYERS:\n• Future Radar: See predicted radar imagery for the next few hours.\n• Future Temperature Map: See predicted future temperatures map.\n\n\nOTHER APP CHANGES INCLUDE:\n• We removed the 'Advanced \u003e Weather Layer Imagery Loops' user preference that was in the old v4.10 app, because the new map kit from our weather provider in this version 4.11 app release does not support this capability.\n\n• Additional under-the-hood maintenance items are included in this release.","releaseDate":"2020-04-01"},{"versionDisplay":"4.10","releaseNotes":"Version 4.10\n\nBUG FIXES:\n• We fixed a bug on iPad where the map didn't properly display across the entire screen when iPad was in Landscape View. As a result of this fix, we've expanded the Location Card view (at the bottom of the map screen) to be more helpful and show more hours when iPad is in Landscape view.\n\n• We fixed another bug where the Hurricane Tracks detail screen could not be closed if it displayed a lot of hurricane track data points.\n\n• We fixed a small bug where the app would crash when attempting to Share a map image to the device's Camera Roll.\n\n• We fixed a small bug that caused the app's Notifications permission box to not display correctly when the user wanted to enable Weather Alerts in the app, but the iOS device itself had notifications disabled (in iOS Settings).\n\n• Additional under-the-hood maintenance items are included in this release.","releaseDate":"2018-11-06"},{"versionDisplay":"4.9","releaseNotes":"Version 4.9\n\nAPP IMPROVEMENTS:\n\nTURN SEVERE WEATHER ALERTS ON OR OFF BY LOCATION\n• This was a popular user request! In Settings, tap Manage Locations, then swipe left on a location name to reveal this new option. Note: Storm Shield supports notifications for up to 25 total locations (for example: 1 Current Location plus 24 Saved Locations).\n\nVOICE PLAYBACK OF AN ALERT'S FULL DETAIL TEXT\n• In the app, when a user taps a location's active alert to read its full text, users can tap a new Play/Pause button at the top of the Alert Detail to have Siri read the complete alert text. This feature is also helpful with Accessibility needs for our visually impaired users.\n\nMORE STORM DETAIL FOR HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS\n• With the Hurricane Tracks overlay enabled, Storm Shield now displays this storm detail: storm name; type of storm (i.e. 'Tropical Depression'); direction, speed, and wind speed; past date and time stamps (i.e. '8 hours ago'); and forecasted date and time stamps (i.e. 'in 2 days').\n\nCUSTOMIZE WEATHER IMAGERY DISPLAY FOR SLOW CELLULAR CONNECTIONS\n• A new Advanced setting lets you set the number of looping imagery frames to display for weather layers (such as radar) if you are on a slow cellular connection. Using less frames will help looping layers like radar display faster, but you won't see as much imagery.\n\n\nACCESSIBILITY FIXES:\n• For our visually-impaired users: when inside the app and you tap an active alert to read its full detail, you can now tap the new Play/Pause button at the top of the Alert Detail screen. This gives Voice Over users more control over the voice read-back of an active alert's full detail text.\n\n• When the iOS Accessibility Voice Over ability was on, and there were multiple locations saved in Storm Shield, and those locations had multiple active alerts, a bug caused one location in the app to get its number of alerts confused with the number of active alerts for other locations in the app. This bug has now been squashed.\n\n• When the iOS Accessibility Voice Over ability was on, and Local Media Provider content appeared in the Location Card Detail screen, a bug caused the 'Live Stream' and 'Full Story' buttons to not be tappable. This bug has now been squashed.\n\n\nOTHER BUG FIXES:\n• We squashed an annoying bug that was causing severe weather notifications to stop working for some users, while these notifications continued to work fine for the majority of users. If your device was affected by this, updating your app and opening this version 4.9 should correct that issue.\n\nIf, after installing and opening this version 4.9 update, you feel you're still not getting weather alert notifications, please submit a Support ticket from within your Storm Shield App, which provides us with additional diagnostic data, and we'll look into it.\n\n• A bug was found in Storm Shield iOS version 4.8 (which was released on July 9, 2018), which caused in-app purchase subscriptions that expired to not actually become disabled correctly in the app for some users. The net result was, some users continued to get access to the premium features for free after the in-app purchase subscription expired. This bug has been corrected in Storm Shield iOS version 4.9.\n\n• A bug was found in Storm Shield, which caused the purchase of an individual in-app subscription feature to inadvertently also unlock the other in-app subscription purchase feature. As an example: if you purchased the individual 'Lightning' feature, you inadvertently also got the separate 'Future Radar' feature for free. This bug has been corrected in Storm Shield iOS version 4.9.\n\n• Additional bug fixes and performance improvements are included in this release.","releaseDate":"2018-09-04"},{"versionDisplay":"4.8","releaseNotes":"Version 4.8\n\nAPP IMPROVEMENTS:\n• NEW! LONG-TAP ON THE MAP:\nYou can now long-tap on the map to get current conditions and weather forecasts for any location in the United States. After dropping a temporary purple pin onto the map, tap the blue 'Info' button to view its current conditions and forecasts. You can also choose to save this location right from the long-tap results display, by tapping the '+' icon in the upper-right corner of the Location Details screen. Long-tap makes it quick and easy to check a location's weather and add a new location to your Saved Locations just by tapping the map.\n\n• 'FUTURE WEATHER' PAID SUBSCRIPTION RENAMED TO 'PREMIUM WEATHER'\nWe renamed the 'Future Weather' paid in-app subscription to 'Premium Weather' to eliminate some confusion caused by the old name. Some users mistakenly thought 'Future Weather' meant they had to pay for Daily and Hourly forecasts, which is not the case. Daily and Hourly forecasts come with your app download at no extra charge.\n\nAs a reminder, the 'Premium Weather' (formerly known as 'Future Weather') paid in-app subscription unlocks these 3 features that are NEW in version 4:\n\n1) Future Radar: See radar into the future (6 hrs on Wi-Fi, 2 hrs on cellular)\n2) Storm Tracks: See how fast storms are moving \u0026 where they're headed\n3) Future Temperature Map: See future temperatures map (12 hrs on Wi-Fi, 5 hrs on cellular)\n\nBUG FIXES:\n• Additional bug fixes and performance improvements are included in this release.","releaseDate":"2018-07-09"},{"versionDisplay":"4.7","releaseNotes":"Version 4.7\n\nAPP IMPROVEMENTS:\n• Widget: Storm Shield App now has a widget for the Today screen on your iOS device! This was a common user request, and we're excited this is now part of the app! Get quick access to active weather alerts, current conditions and a 5-hour forecast for the first location you have in your Storm Shield App. Be sure to enable your widget on your device's Today screen. Storm Shield's widget can also appear on your lock screen for super-quick access if you enabled it.\n\n• 3D Touch: The app's icon is now enabled with 3D Touch, an Apple technology that senses how deeply you press the display in iPhone 6S and later iPhone models. By 3D touching the app icon on your iPhone, you can get quick access to active weather alerts, current conditions and a 5-hour forecast for the first location you have in your Storm Shield App, right from the home screen of your iPhone.\n\n• A new Advanced feature allows you to select your preference to show on the Location Card at the bottom of the map either the 5-hour forecast Conditions or the 5-hour forecast Temperatures. This new preference also takes effect on Storm Shield's new Widget. To set your preference, on the Map screen tap Settings (the gear icon), then Advanced, and under 'Location Cards' select either 'Show Hourly Conditions' or 'Show Hourly Temperatures'. \n\n• Tapping a location pin on the map shows a bubble with a new info button that opens the Location Details screen. (You can still tap the 'More' button on the Location Card at the bottom of the screen to access the same location information.)\n\nBUG FIXES:\n• This includes a patch for the bug fix in version 4.6 that was supposed to clear up duplicate saved locations in the app. Version 4.5 cleared up duplicate current locations, but turns out it did not handle all cases for duplicate saved locations. This version 4.7 should now resolve that for saved locations too. If, after installing version 4.7, your device is still affected by this, please submit a Support ticket from within your Storm Shield App, which provides us with additional diagnostic data, and we’ll look into it.\n\n• Fixed a bug that caused an app crash if you had to delete and then quickly re-install the app (the app could crash if any app settings at the iOS system level were not cleared immediately when the app was deleted, due to some system level app settings that could remain cached for a few extra minutes).\n\n• Additional Accessibility and Voice Over improvements for our visually-impaired users are included in this release.","releaseDate":"2018-05-23"},{"versionDisplay":"4.6","releaseNotes":"Version 4.6\n\n• HOT FIX to ver4.5: Fixes an app crash on startup that only affected older 32-bit devices, such as iPhone 5. This bug got introduced in the version 4.5 release related to the new feature that lets you change the order of your saved locations. It turns out older 32-bit devices, such as iPhone 5, didn't like the new code. This patch should fix that so the app no longer crashes on startup for older 32-bit devices.\n\n• This also fixes a bug that caused the app to crash if you have zero locations saved in the app.\n\n\nVersion 4.5\n\nAPP IMPROVEMENTS:\n• Change the order of your saved locations!

In Settings, tap Manage Locations, then tap 'Edit' to move existing locations up or down the list (tap 'Done' to save the new list order). Note: Current Location (if you allowed it) will always be set to position #1.\n\n• The orange temperature displayed on the Location Card at the bottom of the map screen now shows the 'current conditions temperature' instead of the 'forecasted temperature for the current hour.' We made this change because some users were confused as to why the orange temperature on the Location Card (i.e. the 'forecasted temperature for the current hour') didn't match the orange temperature on the Location Details screen (i.e. 'current conditions temperature').\n\n• Accessibility and Voice Over improvements for our visually-impaired users are included in this release.\n\n• Select the text of an active alert's full details.
