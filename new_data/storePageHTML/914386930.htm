        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I own a 6 (old) my camera was not taking good selfies. I researched and found this app. Read the reviews and compared. I am amazed at how beautiful the pictures came out. My budget is tight but this was the best purchase. It doesn’t slow me down. I can even take video with filters. My favorite is the predicative filters feature. It helps me decide the best filter or I can choose from many others. My selfies are not grainy and I love, love, love this app. I even use it to fix other photos. I highly recommend this app. 5 Stars</p>

    Feature rich, but output resolution disappointing
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>After all the hype in the AppStore, I spent my $.99 and was pleasantly surprised to find such a feature rich app, both for taking photos, and editing images after the fact. While I take very few photos using an I-device, on my iPad and iPad Pro I edit “real” DSLR images usually in the 16-24mp range depending on which camera they come from.  While I really like the feature set of this app, I was really disappointed to find the output resolution being throttled by the limits of the devices graphics processor, i.e., a maximum of 4096 px on either side yielding about a 11.2 mp for a rectangular aspect image.  Downsampling a 24mp image to 11mp is a real disappointment from a printing perspective.  It makes little difference for social media, e-mailing and web apps, but it defeats the purpose of having hi-res images for printing large size prints.  Maybe in new devices, Apple has improved the on-board graphics engine, but since so many other excellent apps have worked there way around this hardware shortcoming, it seems like such a robust app as this deserves better.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I own an iPhone 11 and was excited to use this app. Unfortunately, as soon as I open the app, it crashes. Again and again. I can&#39;t even use this new app on my new phone. I saw the 5 star reviews and was all in. What disappointment...<br /><br />3 hours later, I long-tap the app icon which reveals camera modes to choose from. I tap one of the modes, and yes! I&#39;m in. It crashed multiple times in the beginning, but since I got into the app through the long-tap and it&#39;s still working, I will give it 4 stars for now because it works fast on my iPhone 11 my. I am excited to use the PIP function (I&#39;m usually the one behind the camera). I will be back to re-rate after this pandemic (or maybe during...) Be safe out there everyone.</p>

While I take very few photos using an I-device, on my iPad and iPad Pro I edit “real” DSLR images usually in the 16-24mp range depending on which camera they come from.  While I really like the feature set of this app, I was really disappointed to find the output resolution being throttled by the limits of the devices graphics processor, i.e., a maximum of 4096 px on either side yielding about a 11.2 mp for a rectangular aspect image.  Downsampling a 24mp image to 11mp is a real disappointment from a printing perspective.  It makes little difference for social media, e-mailing and web apps, but it defeats the purpose of having hi-res images for printing large size prints.  Maybe in new devices, Apple has improved the on-board graphics engine, but since so many other excellent apps have worked there way around this hardware shortcoming, it seems like such a robust app as this deserves better.","title":"Feature rich, but output resolution disappointing","userName":"Techno-nut"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5794812315","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-11T07:11:49Z","rating":4,"review":"I own an iPhone 11 and was excited to use this app. Unfortunately, as soon as I open the app, it crashes.

I wanted a good DSLR app that allows me to take photos of the night sky, and the app describes itself to have the parameters necessary for me to do this on my phone, but it doesn’t. It always takes choppy pictures that just look like a light. The app also crashes a lot, and I have an iPhone 8 with a ton of storage, so it shouldn’t be crashing. Overall, I am upset with this app, and I feel as though my money has been wasted for me to take pictures only with peak light sourcing.
