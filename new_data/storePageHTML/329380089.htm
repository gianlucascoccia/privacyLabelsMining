        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The app said the bus was 3 stops away when it was at my stop. My location services were on. The entire ride to work, the app was inaccurate by multiple stops. This is nice for a general idea, but it&#39;s tracking algorithm is clearly not accurate when it comes to how long busses take to get from one stop to the next/can&#39;t account for when busses don&#39;t stop. <br /><br />Fairly disappointing considering the app boasts real time tracking, which I took to mean their is a gps in the bus tracking it. This is not real time tracking. It&#39;s &quot;within 5 minutes tracking&quot;. Not good enough for commuting to work and minimizing time at a bus stop.</p>

    Best bus app I've seen

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app does sensible, useful things, and has a vastly better interface the other transit apps I&#39;ve seen. It has a developer that apparently cares about making it better, which is practically unheard of. It even has good iPad functionality, and takes advantage of the larger format! I&#39;m from San Diego; when I visited LA recently, I sorely missed this app.  Trust me, the alternatives are all much worse. Sure, it&#39;s sometimes a little off on the timing estimates between stops. It doesn&#39;t handle layovers well, assuming the bus will leave early because it&#39;s present before the time it&#39;s scheduled to leave. And when a bus stops at the same stop when going in two different directions, I wish it would separate them out into different listings. But if you want to find, with reasonable accuracy, when a bus will be somewhere, and even filter by routes or bookmark frequently used stops, this is a solid and functional app, and if your local transit company makes use of it, believe me, it&#39;s way better than anything they would&#39;ve come out with themselves. I use it often and am frequently pleased at how not-impossible it is to use, which is high praise for an app of this nature. I rarely encounter bugs, and updates actually bring useful improvements. It&#39;s a rare thing: a free app I&#39;d actually be willing to pay for.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I used to love this app to death and it saved me a lot of time and stress when I first started tracking my buses with it. However, with this latest update, I’ve found that all the buses I’ve taken tend to be running multiple minutes earlier or later than what the app says. The algorithm has gotten altogether inaccurate over the last year or so. This wouldn’t be as frustrating to me, except that with the latest update the dev team removed the in-app reporting system for issues with bus arrival. I don’t know about you, but I neither want to write an email every time I ride a bus because it was ten or more minutes off OBA’s schedule, nor do I want to continue using an app that’s inaccurate where there’s nothing being done to fix it. Sad to say I’ll be moving to a different transit app.</p>

It makes no sense.\n* Show more Recent Stops Quick Actions - The Today widget now appears when you force touch the app's icon, which means that including an option to view your bookmarks seems redundant.\n* Keep loading stop departures until we find one - We'll keep loading depatures on your stop until we find one, which means less tapping and more transit riding.\n* Prevent your phone from going to sleep when you have the Stop Controller visible - Your screen will no longer dim or turn off when you're looking at a stop.\n* View service alerts directly on the stop, instead of having to tap through to see them.\n\nVoiceOver Improvements:\n\n* Improves the accessibility label for the current temperature on the map\n* Make it possible to open stops on the map when VoiceOver is running\n* Adds a special 'nearby stops' button to the map when in voiceover mode\n\nCheers,\nAaron","releaseDate":"2019-01-08"},{"versionDisplay":"18.2.2","releaseNotes":"This is a small release that fixes the biggest causes of crashing bugs in OneBusAway.

(thank you Cathy!)\n* Fixed a bug that caused the app to crash when you accessed a recent stop via force touch.\n* Allows you to specify 1 minute alarm increments when the bus is 10 minutes or less away.\n\n# Today View extension for fast access to your favorite bookmarks\n\nAdd bookmarks to the new Today View bookmark group in order to access them from the Today View (or Lock Screen) widget, allowing you fast and easy access to the routes you use most. No need to unlock your phone in order to find out when the next bus will arrive!\n\n# Map Tab\n\nSome usability improvements have been made to the Map tab. Key among the improvements are new icons and a clearer way to switch between hybrid and standard map styles.\n\n# Bookmarks Tab\n\nAn improved UI for upcoming departures should reduce the amount of text wrapping. Plus general layout improvements, and you can manage your Today View bookmarks from this screen of the app.\n\n# Stops Page\n\n* Improved loading UI on Stop pages\n* After tapping 'Load More Departures,' a time range will appear.\n* Scheduled arrival times (where we don't have real-time data and are relying on the published schedule) are now colored dark gray.\n\n# Arrivals and Departures\n\n* Makes route overlay on map semi-transparent\n* Improve the 'continued trip' experience by ripping out an extraneous interstitial page\n* Removes unnecessary extra text the page title\n\n# General Bugs, Crashes, and Improvements\n\n* Hopefully fixes all of the timeout issues that have been reported - I know that there were some really irritating issues with the app reporting timeout errors. I spent my winter holiday replumbing the networking layer of the app to hopefully fix all of these once and for all. I'm a lot happier with the code, and I think you'll be a lot happier with the overall experience.\n* Fixes the top 10 crashing bugs reported by users - I love fixing crashing bugs! I've spent a ton of time poring over crash reports in order to understand how and where these bugs were coming from, and I've eliminated the vast majority.\n* Improves experience of connecting to 'captive portal' WiFi networks - Have you ever been in a bus tunnel connected to the WiFi network, and been unable to browse the web, read Facebook, or get departure times from OneBusAway? It's because you're connected to a 'captive portal,' where you need to agree to terms of service before you can load any data. OBA can now detect this problem and present you with more information about how to resolve the problem.\n* Fixes bugs around alarm deletion - There were a couple bugs that would, on occasion, prevent you from deleting alarms. These should now be fixed.\n\nAlso, a huge thank you to Edgar for your help on translating OneBusAway into Spanish, and thank you to Jeff for your help on bug fixes in the Today View widget.\n\nAs always,\nAaron\n\np.s.

If you find this feature annoying or incorrect, you can now turn it off from Settings under the Info tab.\n3. Adds walking directions to the '...' button on Stop pages. The feature is smart enough to prompt you to view walking directions in either Apple Maps or Google Maps, depending on what you have installed and what you prefer.\n4. Fixes the walk distance/time indicator when you're at the bus stop. (thank you Gal for your contribution!)\n5. Adds trip status, alarms, and bookmarking to arrival/departure details\n6.

It has a developer that apparently cares about making it better, which is practically unheard of. It even has good iPad functionality, and takes advantage of the larger format! I'm from San Diego; when I visited LA recently, I sorely missed this app.  Trust me, the alternatives are all much worse. Sure, it's sometimes a little off on the timing estimates between stops. It doesn't handle layovers well, assuming the bus will leave early because it's present before the time it's scheduled to leave. And when a bus stops at the same stop when going in two different directions, I wish it would separate them out into different listings. But if you want to find, with reasonable accuracy, when a bus will be somewhere, and even filter by routes or bookmark frequently used stops, this is a solid and functional app, and if your local transit company makes use of it, believe me, it's way better than anything they would've come out with themselves. I use it often and am frequently pleased at how not-impossible it is to use, which is high praise for an app of this nature. I rarely encounter bugs, and updates actually bring useful improvements.

This wouldn’t be as frustrating to me, except that with the latest update the dev team removed the in-app reporting system for issues with bus arrival. I don’t know about you, but I neither want to write an email every time I ride a bus because it was ten or more minutes off OBA’s schedule, nor do I want to continue using an app that’s inaccurate where there’s nothing being done to fix it.

I've been busy fixing bugs, and am excited to finally get these changes into your hands. Here's what's new:\n\n* Fixes an issue with VoiceOver where bookmarks' departure times weren't being read. Also, these times are now being read with the proper format of \"X minutes\" as opposed to the \"X meters\" craziness you would have heard before.\n* Fixes bug that prevented some users from creating alarms.\n* iPhone X compatibility for those of you who are lucky enough to get one next month.\n* Improved visual appearance for error messages.\n* Improved handling of feedback feature for folks who don't like using Mail.app.\n* Updated Spanish translation (thank you, Edgar!)\n* Fixes a rare crash on iPad.\n\n\u003c3,\nAaron","releaseDate":"2017-10-06"},{"versionDisplay":"17.9.0","releaseNotes":"Hi everyone - welcome to iOS 11 and OBA 17.9.0! I'm looking to get back to a more regular cadence of app releases, and we're going to start it off right with this month's small set of changes.\n\n1. Fixes a bug that made it really hard for VoiceOver users to use the Bookmarks tab of the app. \n2. Adds an option to disable the compass heading indicator on the map. If you find this feature annoying or incorrect, you can now turn it off from Settings under the Info tab.\n3. Adds walking directions to the '...' button on Stop pages. The feature is smart enough to prompt you to view walking directions in either Apple Maps or Google Maps, depending on what you have installed and what you prefer.\n4. Fixes the walk distance/time indicator when you're at the bus stop. (thank you Gal for your contribution!)\n5. Adds trip status, alarms, and bookmarking to arrival/departure details\n6. Fixes a handful of app issues on iOS 11.\n\nHappy autumn, and may all of your commutes be easy.\n\nBest,\nAaron","releaseDate":"2017-09-15"},{"versionDisplay":"17.8.0","releaseNotes":"Hey folks - I hope you're enjoying your summer. I sure have! This release makes several small bug fixes and user experience improvements. Before jumping into the exact changes, I wanted to thank Cathy for doing most of the work in this release! She made most of the bug fixes mentioned here, and added our new Chinese localization!\n\nGeneral:\n* Adds Chinese localization\n\nBookmark tab improvements:\n* Improve visual design of bookmark tab's navigation bar title\n* Fix issue where the cells' contextual actions sometimes disappeared\n* Show departures up to 60 minutes out from present.\n\nStops:\n* Show a 'zoom to location' button on the vehicle map page (thank you Serg!)\n\nAlarms:\n* Update info about alarms after they change.\n* Display estimated departure for vehicles represented by alarms instead of scheduled departure.\n\nAs always, thank you Edgar for maintaining our Spanish localization.\n\nAaron","releaseDate":"2017-08-31"},{"versionDisplay":"17.4.3","releaseNotes":"Third time's the charm, I hope. Sorry about the continued region issues, but hopefully this release will sort those problems out. Plus, you'll find a number of delightful UI niceties in this release. Here are the highlights:\n\n* Vehicles on the trip status map only 'pulse' when they have real-time data associated with them. Hopefully this'll make it a bit more clear when we're just showing data from the schedule.\n\nA huge thank you to new contributor Cathy who fixed a ton of bugs for this release! Here's what Cathy did:\n\n* Disables the 'Set Alarm' option when the bus has already departed.\n* Improve the visual consistency of the regional alerts UI.\n* Fix cases where your location on the map would end up on top of a stop's callout.\n* Make the map style shown on the map match the Stop page header.\n\nAnd, again, a huge \"thank you\" to Edgar for his continued effort in localizing OBA into Spanish.

I assumed that the data we were getting from the server was going to always make sense.
