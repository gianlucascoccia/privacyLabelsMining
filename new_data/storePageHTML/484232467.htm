        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>PLEASE LISTEN THIS TIME.  This is my serious request.  When I&#39;m watching a show on Showtime..like &quot;Shameless&quot; for instance, at times I may feel like I missed something that a particular character said.  When this happens, I want to quickly go back a short bit (like 10 seconds) to hear again what little bit I think I may have missed.  So I just want to go back a little to hear it again.  But I don&#39;t want to have to go back 30 seconds just to hear the bit that I missed just a few seconds ago.  And sometimes I may want to do it a couple of times.  In that case, I&#39;m having to go all the way back 30 seconds each time and wait until it finally gets to the part I want to hear again.  That&#39;s frustrating!  If I had trouble understanding what a character said, I may have to listen to it again three times (in some cases).  So it&#39;s both frustrating and time consuming when it goes back 30 seconds, when all I want is for it to go back just a little bit.  So please change the rewind icon to 10 seconds instead of 30!  PLEASE!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Just a heads up. This is one of the absolute worst “privacy policies” and “term of use” I have ever read in my life. Carefully read thru them. When it comes to every single thing you do online with your phone, they track it, store it and share it, once you agree to their service. Then it’s now open information to absolutely anyone Showtime decides to share it with, including BUT not limited to your internet browsing, purchases online and ALL online activity on your phone. This information can be shared with your contacts on Facebook, Google and any other companies Showtime has an agreement with at this time or on the future. They indicate you can adjust your privacy settings at EACH of any of their partners. However, you CANNOT adjust your privacy settings with them. And of course you will have no idea how many partners they are sharing your information with at all. <br /><br />Unbelievable, I love the Showtime content but they have lost me as an online customer and until they offer the ability to choose to share your information with their partners, absolutely no one in my house with use this App. So disappointing.<br />I would give 0 stars if it was possible for signing away any form of privacy just to view content online that you already can watch at home. Absolutely Crazy.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Wow from reading the other reviews I believe showtime is using this app to sell our information. Here is why. <br />Someone mentioned the apps permission and terms of service gives it access to a whole lot of personal information that it can use to make money that is unnecessary for it to need. 2. You MUST have the app to activate a smart tv. There is no other way. People mention the activation needs to be reactivated every week or so. This keeps the app on your phone. Giving showtime access to all your sensitive data a the time. Bravo showtime. Great money making idea!!! I’ll check with others to see what they think about this. <br /><br />Really inconvient you have to download an app to activate a device. Other providers have a simple webpage that does this. You want me to take up room on my phone that’s crazy. Also my stepmom doesn’t even know how to install an app. I’m sure a lot of people tried to activate their TVs and failed and quit out of frustration. What if your extremely unlucky and your phone is broken? Sorry no phone - no showtime.  Older people also sometimes have flip phones and no data. Whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired. Ok it’s great to have this as an option but follow from every other networks example and use a webpage. People are familiar with.</p>

Provider is committed to protecting the privacy of its users and has prepared this Privacy Policy to inform users concerning the protection of privacy on Provider's websites, mobile and connected TV applications, features, products and services that include an authorized link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, \"Services\").\n\nThis Privacy Policy describes, among other things, the types of information collected about you when you visit the Services; how your information may be used and when it may be disclosed; how you can control the use and disclosure of your information; and how your information is protected.\n\n1. Scope of Privacy Policy\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to information, including contact information, collected about you by our Services. Please review this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review our Terms of Use, which govern your use of the Services.\n\nPlease note that the Services are intended solely and exclusively for residents of the United States, its territories and possessions (\"U.S.\") while they are located in the U.S. Accordingly, this Privacy Policy is specifically directed only towards residents of the U.S. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S. and you use the Site contrary to our Terms of Use, you do so at your own risk and initiative, and are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and national laws. Please be aware that any information you submit to us will be transferred to and processed in the U.S and subject to U.S. law, which may not be equivalent to the laws in your country of residence. By using the Site and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this collection, transfer, storage and processing of information to and in the U.S., and waive any claims that may arise under your own local and national laws.\n\n2. Information Collected\n\nInformation you provide directly to Provider Services.\n\nYou are not required to provide information about yourself when you visit our Services. Our Services may ask you for different types of information when you register for certain services, access various content or features, or directly contact the Services including:\n* Contact information, such as name, email address, postal address, phone number, facsimile number, and mobile number;\n* User name, password, and password reminder questions and answers;\n* Authentication and sub-account information for Showtime Anytime;\n* Age and date of birth;\n* Other demographic information, such as gender, job information, and postal code;\n* Public information, including profile information, you provide to the Provider Services for publication, such as your user name, comments, likes, interests, status, pictures and the address of your website;\n* Information you provide if you complete a survey that we use for research purposes, or enter a sweepstakes, contest or other online promotion;\n* Communications preferences, such as which newsletters you would like to receive;\n* Search queries;\n* In limited circumstances, payment information, such as credit card number, where needed for payment, to complete a particular transaction, or to access a particular service;\n* Information posted in community discussions and other interactive online features, including so-called \"user generated content\" and \"feedback\" and postings to third-party social media sites through the Services (collectively, \"User Submissions\");\n* Information you provide if you report a problem with the Site or contact us for other reasons; and\n* Information collected about you offline (including via facsimile, mail, or in person for sweepstakes entrance forms).\n\nInformation we collect automatically on Provider Services.\n\nOur Services may collect certain information automatically, including:\n* Your browser type and operating system;\n* Your Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is the number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet and that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area;\n* Your Internet Service Provider (ISP);\n* Websites you visited immediately before and after visiting our Services;\n* Web pages and advertisements you view, links you click on within our Services and other clickstream data;\n* Unique identifiers, including device identification numbers that can identify the physical location of such devices in accordance with applicable law;\n* Information collected through cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and other similar technologies;\n* Information about your interactions with audio and video content, such as the type of content listened to and viewed, and information about your interactions with email messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded;\n* Your bandwidth speed and information about the software programs installed on your computer including registry key information; and\n* Standard server log information, including date/time information.\n\nSome Internet browsers include the ability to transmit \"Do Not Track\" signals.

(http://www.allaboutdnt.com/)\"\n\nInformation we obtain from other sources.\n\nWhere permitted by applicable law, we may collect information about you from other sources, including through interactive applications (e.g., mobile devices, third party services, and embedded audio and video players), from co-branded partners and websites (e.g., on our Facebook pages), and from commercially available sources (e.g., data aggregators and public databases). The following are examples of information we may collect from other sources:\n* Name, postal address, and telephone number;\n* Demographic data, such as age, gender, and income level;\n* If you access third party services (e.g., Facebook, Google+ or Twitter) through a Provider Service, or if you access a Provider Service through a third party service, your username and password for those services and other information available about or collected from you on those services, as described in our Video Services and Social Networking Policy;\n* Your interests and purchase behavior;\n* Publicly-observed data, such as activities on blogs, videos, and other online postings; and\n* Other navigation data, such as websites visited and advertisements viewed or clicked on.\n\nCombining information.\n\nPlease note that all of the information we collect about you may be combined, including to help us tailor our communications to you and to develop rich online content and services across our Services.\n\nInformation collected by third parties.\n\nThe Services may use services provided by third-party advertising and market research companies. When you visit the Services, these companies may use technologies such as cookies and pixel tags to collect information such as your IP address, video content that you have watched and what page you are visiting when you view a page, video, or email in which a tag is embedded.

If you would like more information on your choices regarding this practice and the use of this information, visit here (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and here (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).\n\nWhen you select a link from one of our Services to a third party service, any information that you disclose on the third party service will be governed by that service's privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy.\n\n3. Use of Information\n\nWe only use payment information, such as credit card numbers, as necessary for completing a particular transaction or fulfilling a service (e.g., paid subscriptions or awarding prizes to contest winners) or as otherwise required by law.\n\nWe generally use other information we collect about you to:\n* Fulfill your requests for products, services, and information, including to send you electronic newsletters, authorize a purchase, complete a transaction that you have requested, or serve you when you have questions or problems;\n* Enable you to participate in features and activities such as surveys, polls, sweepstakes, message boards, interviews and other research activities;\n* Provide you with electronic newsletters, information, special offers and promotional materials on behalf of our Services, companies within our corporate family, and third parties, in accordance with applicable law;\n* Operate our Services and analyze the use of our Services and information about visitors to our Services to understand and improve our service offerings and, in accordance with our sharing policies, discussed below, to produce or disclose anonymous or aggregated data and statistics that might help third parties develop their own products and service offerings;\n* Customize the content you see when you visit our Services;\n* Develop and provide advertising tailored to your interests;\n* Prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities and otherwise in accordance with Provider's Terms of Use; and\n* For any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent.\n\n4.

With your consent, we may share your contact information with third party marketing partners.\n* User Submissions. Publication of User Submissions is subject to our Terms of Use. Please remember that any information you disclose becomes public information and exercise caution when deciding to disclose your contact, financial, and other information in a User Submission.\n* Authorized service providers. We may share your contact information and other information about you with vendors that help us with specialized services, including customer support, payment processing, account management, email and text message deployment, business analytics, marketing, suppression list management and data processing. These vendors are allowed to use your information to help us provide our services and not for any other purpose. Also, authorized service providers may collect non-contact information about your visits to our Services with cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies that may be used to deliver advertisements or marketing tailored to your interests.\n* Sweepstakes, contests, or promotions. When you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the promotions, your information may be disclosed to our sponsors and third parties who help design, administer and implement the promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment and aggregated data analysis.

All terms applicable to the particular promotion will be made available to you at the time you enter the promotion.\n* Co-Branded Partners. Co-Branded Partners are third parties with whom a Service may jointly offer a service or feature. You can tell when you are accessing a service or feature offered by a Co-Branded Partner because the Co-Branded Partner's name will be featured prominently. You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a Co-Branded Partner.

Your California Privacy Rights\nThis Section 9 contains additional provisions that apply if you are a resident of the State of California.\n\n9.1 California Consumer Protection Act\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") provides consumers who are residents of the State of California with specific rights related to their personal information, subject to certain exceptions. It also requires us to disclose the information we collect, the purposes for which we collect it, and what we share and disclose.\n\n9.2 The Personal Information We Collect and Why\nYou have the right to know what personal information we collect and why. The information we collect and the purposes for which we use it are described in this Privacy Policy under \"Information Collected\" and \"Use of Information\" above.\n\n9.3 The Personal Information We Share or Disclose\nYou have the right to know what personal information we disclose or share with third parties.

You may make such requests up to twice a year.\n\n9.5 Right to Delete\nYou have the right to ask us to delete your personal information.

The CCPA refers to this as your right to say \"Do Not Sell\" my personal information.

When you make a request online, we will verify your identity by sending you an email and asking you to respond. When you call the toll-free number, you must leave a name and address or email address we can use to contact you.\nIf you ask what personal information we have received from you, and we cannot verify your identity, or if providing the information you have requested creates a security risk, we will give you a general description of the type of personal information we have about you.\nIf you ask us to delete your personal information, and we can't verify your identity and confirm that you made the request, we will not be able to honor it. Generally, though, if we can confirm your identity and your request, we will delete, de-identify, or aggregate your personal information so it can no longer be associated with you. There are some reasons that the law may require or permit us to keep your personal information, however.\n\n9.7.2 Opt-Out (Do Not Sell)\nIf you do not want us to disclose or transfer your personal information to a third party in exchange for something valuable, you may opt out by clicking Do Not Sell (https://ca.privacy.cbs/donotsell) or calling 1(888)-841-3343.

We will contact you with further instructions to process your request in accordance with the CCPA requirements. In general, you will need to provide proof that you are registered with the Attorney General, as required by law, and proof you have written authority to act for the consumer. You shall also provide the email address of the consumer you are representing so we can verify their identity or provide documentation that you have power of attorney for the consumer pursuant to Probate Code sections 4000-4465. We will not be able to honor requests without sufficient documentation that you are authorized to represent the consumer or that you are registered with the Attorney General.\n\n9.7.4 Requests made on behalf of a \"Household\"\nIf you would like to request personal information about your household, you must submit your request at http://privacy.cbs/managemyrights.

We will accept requests to exercise these rights only through this form with the proper subject line and complete and accurate information.\n\n9.12 Contacting Us\nYou may contact us with questions about Your California Privacy Rights at Privacy@cbs.com or\n\nShowtime Networks Inc.\n1633 Broadway\nNew York, NY 10019\nAttn: Legal Department, Privacy Inquiries\n\n10.

This information is limited to direct identifiers, such as your name, postal address, and email address.

Your California Privacy Rights\nThis Section 9 contains additional provisions that apply if you are a resident of the State of California.\n\n9.1 California Consumer Protection Act\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") provides consumers who are residents of the State of California with specific rights related to their personal information, subject to certain exceptions. It also requires us to disclose the information we collect, the purposes for which we collect it, and what we share and disclose.\n\n9.2 The Personal Information We Collect and Why\nYou have the right to know what personal information we collect and why. The information we collect and the purposes for which we use it are described in this Privacy Policy under \"Information Collected\" and \"Use of Information\" above.\n\n9.3 The Personal Information We Share or Disclose\nYou have the right to know what personal information we disclose or share with third parties.

You may make such requests up to twice a year.\n\n9.5 Right to Delete\nYou have the right to ask us to delete your personal information.

The CCPA refers to this as your right to say \"Do Not Sell\" my personal information.

When you make a request online, we will verify your identity by sending you an email and asking you to respond. When you call the toll-free number, you must leave a name and address or email address we can use to contact you.\nIf you ask what personal information we have received from you, and we cannot verify your identity, or if providing the information you have requested creates a security risk, we will give you a general description of the type of personal information we have about you.\nIf you ask us to delete your personal information, and we can't verify your identity and confirm that you made the request, we will not be able to honor it. Generally, though, if we can confirm your identity and your request, we will delete, de-identify, or aggregate your personal information so it can no longer be associated with you. There are some reasons that the law may require or permit us to keep your personal information, however.\n\n9.7.2 Opt-Out (Do Not Sell)\nIf you do not want us to disclose or transfer your personal information to a third party in exchange for something valuable, you may opt out by clicking Do Not Sell (https://ca.privacy.cbs/donotsell) or calling 1(888)-841-3343.

We will contact you with further instructions to process your request in accordance with the CCPA requirements. In general, you will need to provide proof that you are registered with the Attorney General, as required by law, and proof you have written authority to act for the consumer. You shall also provide the email address of the consumer you are representing so we can verify their identity or provide documentation that you have power of attorney for the consumer pursuant to Probate Code sections 4000-4465. We will not be able to honor requests without sufficient documentation that you are authorized to represent the consumer or that you are registered with the Attorney General.\n\n9.7.4 Requests made on behalf of a \"Household\"\nIf you would like to request personal information about your household, you must submit your request at http://privacy.cbs/managemyrights.

We will accept requests to exercise these rights only through this form with the proper subject line and complete and accurate information.\n\n9.12 Contacting Us\nYou may contact us with questions about Your California Privacy Rights at Privacy@cbs.com or\n\nShowtime Networks Inc.\n1633 Broadway\nNew York, NY 10019\nAttn: Legal Department, Privacy Inquiries\n\n10.

When I'm watching a show on Showtime..like \"Shameless\" for instance, at times I may feel like I missed something that a particular character said.  When this happens, I want to quickly go back a short bit (like 10 seconds) to hear again what little bit I think I may have missed.  So I just want to go back a little to hear it again.  But I don't want to have to go back 30 seconds just to hear the bit that I missed just a few seconds ago.  And sometimes I may want to do it a couple of times.  In that case, I'm having to go all the way back 30 seconds each time and wait until it finally gets to the part I want to hear again.  That's frustrating!  If I had trouble understanding what a character said, I may have to listen to it again three times (in some cases).  So it's both frustrating and time consuming when it goes back 30 seconds, when all I want is for it to go back just a little bit.  So please change the rewind icon to 10 seconds instead of 30!

Here is why. \nSomeone mentioned the apps permission and terms of service gives it access to a whole lot of personal information that it can use to make money that is unnecessary for it to need. 2. You MUST have the app to activate a smart tv. There is no other way. People mention the activation needs to be reactivated every week or so. This keeps the app on your phone. Giving showtime access to all your sensitive data a the time. Bravo showtime. Great money making idea!!! I’ll check with others to see what they think about this. \n\nReally inconvient you have to download an app to activate a device. Other providers have a simple webpage that does this. You want me to take up room on my phone that’s crazy. Also my stepmom doesn’t even know how to install an app. I’m sure a lot of people tried to activate their TVs and failed and quit out of frustration. What if your extremely unlucky and your phone is broken? Sorry no phone - no showtime.  Older people also sometimes have flip phones and no data. Whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired. Ok it’s great to have this as an option but follow from every other networks example and use a webpage.

I could be using the app on a Monday night, for example, and by Tuesday night, I’m forced to log in again. I don’t know why this is. My app is currently up to date, but it does this to me all the time. It also does it when I haven’t used the app for a week or so, which is still annoying, but I’m in the middle of a movie right now, and I was forced to get out of bed and re-activate my device...three times before it finally accepted it. \n\nOther than that, I really enjoy using Showtime Anytime. I do wish the closed captioning had an option to make the font bigger, though. I love the 10 second fast forward and rewind feature, which HBOMax recently got rid of, and I’m avoiding that app like the plague until it’s fixed. Please never get rid of that feature, because sometimes I miss a detail during my show/movie, and it’s wonderful to be able to quickly go back\n\nOverall, I feel like I’m getting a lot of bang for my buck since I pay so much a month for cable, Showtime included. Spectrum rarely has this much to offer when I look at Showtime on demand when I’m watching regular TV, so having an AppleTV opened my eyes to all the content I’ve been paying for, with no way to watch. \n\nKeep up the great work, Showtime.

You have to go back to the Home Screen (see next line item for the issues with the Home Screen) and/or re-search for the series you are watching. \n- lagging Home Screen (for example, if I finish an episode, I have to completely close out of the app and then go and search for the next episode instead of it appearing on the Home Screen or automatically starting.
