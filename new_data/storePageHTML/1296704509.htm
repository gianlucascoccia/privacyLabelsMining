        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>App is almost awful. It’s 2021 and still no PiP support almost every other service has this option in iOS. Not only that the app usually reloads every time if you leave and go back even for a split second. It just seems poorly coded for 2021. Just seems like it should be faster shouldn’t reload every time you enter the app and should have real iOS Picture in Picture support. I’ve been complaining about this for over a year and yet the only updates to this all are to conform to apples new App Store guidelines for iOS.  Cable tv is extremely expensive and for the money you should get more especially since the competition has everything I speak of. Fail.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hello, Jamez n DK. Thank you very much for your review. We are sorry to hear that the app did not meet your expectations. The Altice One app does have Picture in Picture support. When the video restarts instead of resuming where it left off, is that from a video on demand stream? Please connect with us through email so that we may investigate this issue closer. Your feedback is very important to us and will consider your suggestions in future releases. </p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This has got to be one of the most worthless apps around. On my iPad it keeps telling me I have the wrong app, but there are no others. On my AppleTV it keeps telling me I have a 403 error. Suddenlink is nearly impossible to get in touch with and my past experiences are they can’t solve the problem anyway. Ugh!!! Update: I spent over an hour on chat with Suddenlink. We went through a whole list of things such as deleting and reinstalling the app, opening and closing, etc. After over an hour my problem was “escalated”. I was told they would get in touch if they needed additional information. I asked if they would get in touch to tell me the problem fixed. I was given the same answer. I am tired of wasting my time and don’t understand why they just don’t make a decent app. There are plenty of good programmers out there. Apple - remove this from the app store until it is fixed. Maybe that will get their attention.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This Altice company is French, and is not Optimun anymore, they bought “Cablevision” and depend of the boxes you have. I have the “Altice” all in one that doesn’t need a Router. For the situation with the CV-19, they haven’t been doing the regular updates they usually do during the nights in order not to interrupt the viewers programs, because they have been working remotely.<br /><br />Also, I learn how to do myself because I understand is so frustrating to trying to watch your programs and cannot do it because you have not idea what to do.<br /><br />Here is my little help, If you have the “Altice” black box  and also the small one if you have a secondary tv’s, unplug the main box from the back of it, for about 2-3 minutes, and plugged back and let it rebutted by itself, you can do that with your tv on that will show you a dark screen for few seconds, and then you’ll see how starting the rebutting of the box, and  when finished the time will come out again, and turn on the box and you’ll see the program’s back.<br /><br />I hope my suggestions work, and if he doesn’t at first, try again.<br /><br />Good luck.</p>

This notice is designed to give you a general understanding of how Altice protects your privacy in connection with our residential and business cable television services (such as Optimum TV), high-speed Internet services (such as Optimum Online), voice services (such as Optimum Voice) and any other cable service or communication service we may provide to you using our cable system as such services are defined by applicable law, as well as Optimum.net (together \"Covered Services\").\r\nThis notice does not generally cover other Altice websites, such as Optimum.com, interactive television channels, or other products or services that may be accessed through Covered Services. These other services are governed by separate privacy notices, which we encourage you to review when using these other services to understand how your information is handled. This notice only covers Altice's Optimum services and does not cover Altice's Lightpath and Suddenlink service.\r\n\r\nIn this notice, \"we\" and \"Altice\" refer to CSC Holdings, LLC (formerly CSC Holdings, Inc.) and/or any affiliate of CSC Holdings, LLC that owns, operates, or provides Covered Services.\r\n \r\nA. Information We Collect and Receive, and How We Collect It\r\nIn connection with the initiation and ongoing provisioning of Covered Services, as well as with our ongoing efforts to improve the quality and value of the Covered Services, we may maintain certain information related to you that you provide to us or that we collect using the cable systems (\"Subscriber Information\"). Certain Subscriber Information may be personally identifiable (\"Personally Identifiable Information\"). Personally Identifiable Information does not include, among other things, any aggregate data or other data which does not identify a particular person or information which by itself does not identify a particular person, such as your zip code, gender, IP Address, MAC address or other equipment identifiers, or certain other unique numbers or codes. We may collect Personally Identifiable Information using the cable system in order to obtain information necessary to render our cable service or other services to our subscribers or to detect unauthorized reception of cable communications, as well as for other purposes described in this notice.\r\n\r\nWhen You Interact With Us: Subscriber Information may include information which you provide to us such as your name, service address, billing address, work address, email address, home telephone number, work telephone number, mobile phone number, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, credit card number and expiration date, bank account number, and other financial information. In addition, as part of our normal course of business, we generate and maintain billing and account information such as your billing history, the services to which you have subscribed, your payment history, your maintenance and repair history, the kind, location, configuration, device identifiers, MAC, and IP addresses of equipment (including TV sets, set-top boxes, CableCARDs, modems, telephones, IP enabled devices) connected to our facilities. For customer services purposes, we also may keep copies of correspondence concerning your account or records of complaints or inquiries that may be made about our service. In addition, we may sometimes collect responses to customer satisfaction surveys for analytics and research purposes. We may also collect information that helps us detect unauthorized use of our services.\r\n\r\nWhen You Use Our Services: We may also collect service-specific Subscriber Information depending on the Covered Services to which you subscribe. For example:\r\n•\tOptimum Voice. If you are a subscriber of a covered Altice voice service such as Optimum Voice (which is an interconnected Voice-over-Internet Protocol \"VoIP\" service), we may collect customer proprietary network information (\"CPNI\"). CPNI is information that relates to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of use of an interconnected VoIP service or telecommunications service subscribed to by any customer, and that is made available to the carrier by the customer solely by virtue of the provider-customer relationship; and information contained in the bills pertaining to interconnected VoIP service, telephone exchange service or telephone toll service received by a customer. CPNI does not include the \"subscriber list information\" we collect, which includes your name, address, and telephone number that has been published or accepted for publication in any directory format, as well as (for business listings) your primary advertising classifications. The disclosure and use of CPNI is subject to specialized restrictions as described in Section F below.\r\n•\tInternet Service, including Optimum Online and Optimum WiFi Hotspots. If you subscribe to a covered Altice high-speed Internet service such as Optimum Online, we may collect broadband data, including information regarding geolocation and/or service usage, including bandwidth used (including for specific third party website traffic and app usage), system and connection performance, browsers used, device type, device identifiers, dates and times of access, and internet resource requests/browsing history (such as a log of visited URLs). We may maintain records of Internet Protocol addresses and email accounts that we assign to you, as well as any violations or alleged violations of applicable terms and conditions of usage. Additional information about our privacy practices specific to our high-speed Internet service, including more detail regarding data collection, can be found in the Additional Privacy Information for High Speed Internet Service.\r\n•\tOptimum TV. If you are a digital cable television subscriber, we may also automatically collect information about your use of our systems, such as changing your television channel, reviewing listings in an electronic program guide, using your remote, interacting with your DVR, ordering or viewing on-demand programming, engaging in other interactive programming features, or when using the Optimum App (such as audio files when using voice-based search) or other similar IP enabled device applications. We collect this information for purposes and uses including billing, service optimization, troubleshooting and customer service, operations, programming, including VOD, pay-per-view, program and content recommendation features and functions, advertising targeting and optimization, data analytics, e-Bill, operation of certain Optimum Select services, and as otherwise described in the following section.\r\n \r\nInformation Provided to Us by Third Parties: Sometimes, we also obtain additional information from publicly available sources such as research consultants, data service providers, and marketing firms to supplement the information we collect from you. From time to time, we may combine this publicly available information with information that we collect from you. In addition, we may also obtain information from our business partners and/or their service providers or clients, to assist with data collection, reporting and ad response measurement, as well as to assist with delivering and analyzing the performance of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. The types of information that we may receive from third parties includes, but is not limited to demographic data (including, but not limited to gender or age range) and interest data (including, but not limited to demonstrated interest in or interaction with a particular product/website).\r\n\r\nWe participate in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op to better understand how you use our website and apps across the various devices you use, and to deliver services and advertising that are of an enhanced value and interest to you. Click here to learn more about how Adobe does this and to manage your choices relating to this linking of devices.\r\n\r\nInformation Collected on Our Websites: We collect data about visitors to our subscriber website, Optimum.net, using automated means such as cookies, clear GIFs, and passive automatic electronic collection, which are described in more detail in our Website Privacy Notice. We may work with third-party companies to engage in such collection.\r\nB. How We Use Subscriber Information\r\nWe use Subscriber Information, including Personally Identifiable Information, to conduct business activities such as account administration, service provisioning, operations, billings and collections, marketing, analytics, customer service, technical support, manage network performance, and for fraud prevention. These purposes may specifically include the use of Personally Identifiable Information to:\r\n•\thelp us provide high-quality, competitively-priced Covered Services in an efficient manner;\r\n•\tensure that you receive the services to which you have subscribed and execute requests that you make;\r\n•\tprovide you with programming, services and advertising that are of an enhanced value and interest to you;\r\n•\tfacilitate billing and collections functions and obligations (including any reporting to credit bureaus or collection agencies to obtain payment for our billed products and services);\r\n•\tprovide you with accurate and high quality customer service, including responding to subscriber inquiries and troubleshooting;\r\n•\tcomply with tax obligations, accounting rules, and contractual obligations to vendors;\r\n•\tensure that you receive information about products and services that may be of interest to you;\r\n•\tensure compliance with applicable laws and the terms, conditions, notices and policies governing the Covered Services;\r\n•\tprotect our rights, such as preventing fraud, service theft, and abusive practices; and\r\n•\timprove our facilities and the services that we provide over them.\r\n \r\nWe may use Subscriber Information to generate de-identified or aggregated information - that is, data from which Personally Identifiable Information has been removed. We may also employ automated processes to generate de-identified or aggregated information from any of our Covered Services. De-identified or aggregated information does not identify you in a personal way, and our collection, use, and disclosure of de-identified or aggregate information is not subject to any of the restrictions in this notice and its use and disclosure is subject to our discretion. For example, we may use de-identified or aggregated information for purposes such as measurement of viewership of programming and advertising, creation of tuning and viewing cohorts or segmentations, providing targeted content for our services or facilitating delivery of relevant third party advertising/promotional messages through our Covered Services and on third party websites and other platforms.\r\n\r\nWe may use certain Subscriber Information, including viewing activity and other use of the cable system (as described in Section A above), broadband data (also as described in Section A) and Personally Identifiable Information, for marketing or analytics purposes. Such use may include facilitating display ads for our products and services shown to you on other websites and web services across the Internet. When we do this, we may provide third party service providers with access to certain of your Personally Identifiable Information in order to place de-identified coded data into cookies on your browser (or employ similar technology), and to provide you with more relevant offers and updates through display media. \r\n\r\nIf you are a digital cable television or internet subscriber, we may use de-identified viewing activity or usage data that we have collected and/or IP address(es) we assign to subscribers, in combination with data we receive or license from third parties (such as data collected when you visit or log in to third party websites or engage in offline transactions), to deliver television and digital ads to audiences based on demographic information (e.g., gender or household size) and/or interest information (e.g., travel or sports) across different screens and platforms. We may also work with third party data and service providers who de-identify data we hold to facilitate this advertising and link it to the above third party data. You can opt out of certain marketing messages as described in the Access and Choice section below.\r\n\r\nOur use of certain Subscriber Information associated with voice service however, is limited as described in Section F below.\r\n\r\nIndividuals who may be authorized to have access to Personally Identifiable Information include our employees, agents, and affiliates within our family of affiliated businesses though we seek to limit access to individuals on a need to know basis. Sometimes, we may provide access to certain Personally Identifiable Information to select third parties to assist us in providing services or for other legitimate business purposes. For example, we may provide access to certain information to companies providing services to us, including installation and repair, billing, call center, sales and marketing, market research, fulfilment, mailings, data storage, data scrubbing, data analytics and processing, bill collection, auditing and accounting, credit reporting, and legal services. We may also provide access to third parties who assist us in providing targeted advertising and audience analysis services, opportunities and initiatives. We will provide access to CPNI (a term described in Section A above) for use in sales and marketing only to our agents and affiliates. The frequency of such access depends on our business needs.\r\n\r\nGeolocation Data: We use service address, device and/or access point location data for a variety of purposes, including to facilitate emergency services, provide our services, our and third-party location-based applications and services including, but not limited to, navigation, promotional offers, weather services and the like and deliver location-based or other advertising that may be of interest to you and/or for reporting and ad response measurement. Where we offer our own location-based applications, we provide you with notice and choice about whether specific location-tracking features available on your device are turned on.\r\n\r\nMany types of wireless applications and services use device location data, including applications provided by other companies and wireless device operating systems. When you are considering new third party applications or services, you should carefully review the location-based services' or application providers' privacy policies to learn how they collect and use your information.\r\nC. When We Disclose Subscriber Information\r\nExcept as set forth below, Altice will not disclose Personally Identifiable Information to third parties unless:\r\n•\tit is necessary for us to render our Covered Services or conduct a legitimate business activity related to our Covered Services;\r\n•\tor you provide appropriate consent in advance.\r\n \r\nIf you subscribe to a non-voice Covered Service, we may rely on a special provision of law that allows us to disclose mailing-list information about you to marketing organizations, programmers and other businesses. Mailing-list information includes your name, addresses, and the non-voice services to which you subscribe (for example, basic tier, HBO). IF YOU DO NOT WANT US TO DISCLOSE MAILING-LIST INFORMATION ABOUT YOU ON THE BASIS OF THAT PROVISION OF LAW, PLEASE CALL US AT 1-888-425-2089. Please note, your opt-out preferences may not take effect immediately and cannot be applied retroactively. After your opt-out takes effect, we will limit our disclosures of your mailing-list information to the other disclosures described in this notice, which are permitted by other provisions of law.\r\n\r\nIf you subscribe to a covered Altice voice service such as Optimum Voice, applicable regulations allow us to disclose subscriber list information. For example, we may give your name, address, and number to organizations who publish phone directories or who provide 411 services or similar public services. We may transmit your name and number so that the person you call can see such information on his or her Caller ID. Certain procedures allow you to block transmission of Caller ID information. You may contact us to obtain additional information about these procedures. We may also transmit your name, number, and registered location to a public safety answering point (\"PSAP\") when you dial 911 for emergency services. Disclosure of CPNI data is subject to additional specific limitations, as described in Section F below.\r\n\r\nWe may also provide your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties when you expressly consent to such disclosure, such as when you interact or make purchases from third party vendors who utilize Optimum technology or request information from third parties through certain interactive channels.\r\n\r\nWe may furnish certain de-identified information, on either an aggregate or non-aggregate basis, (which may include information about viewing habits, geolocation and system interaction) to third parties, such as advertisers and programmers, for purposes that may include but not be limited to providing you with more relevant programming, advertising and features, increasing the value of the Covered Services, providing you with information or offers about products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, or assisting third parties with media, programming and content planning and purchasing efforts. Likewise, if you are a digital cable subscriber, we may work with third party data and service providers who de-identify data about you so that we may facilitate advertising based on demographic or interest-based data collected from different platforms, whether offline or online (such as information collected when you visit or log in to a website).\r\n\r\nYou acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve and disclose your Subscriber Information, including your Personally Identifiable Information, your account information and content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:\r\n•\tcomply with legal process;\r\n•\tenforce our Terms of Service, Privacy Notice(s), or other contracts with you;\r\n•\trespond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties;\r\n•\trespond to your requests for customer service;\r\n•\trespond to inquiries from government agencies regarding customer-initiated complaints provided to such agencies;\r\n•\tor protect the rights, property or personal safety of Altice, its agents and affiliates, its users and the public.\r\n \r\nWe may also disclose information to law enforcement agencies in emergency circumstances, where the disclosure of such information is consistent with the types of emergency disclosures permitted or required by law.\r\nFinally, we also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all of your Subscriber Information, including your Personally Identifiable Information, to a successor company in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all, or components, of our business.\r\nD. We May Keep Information About You for Some Time\r\nWe generally keep some or all Subscriber Information for as long as necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was collected or as required by law. When information is no longer needed or required to be maintained, we destroy it in accordance with our internal policies.\r\n \r\nE. Access and Choice\r\nYou also have the right to inspect Personally Identifiable Information that Altice has collected and maintains in connection with the provision of Covered Services to you. If you would like access to such information, please notify us in writing at the local business office specified on your service bill. We will then contact you to set up an appointment during regular business hours. Please note, Altice reserves the right to charge you its reasonable costs in connection with retrieving Subscriber Information and providing you with access thereto. In order to obtain telephone CPNI, please see Section F below.\r\n\r\nSubscribers may choose not to receive promotional or marketing telephone calls or postal mailings regarding the Covered Services by contacting us at 1-888-425-2088 for placement on Altice's \"Do Not Call\" list or by contacting us at 1-888-425-2090 for placement on Altice's \"Do Not Mail\" list. Please note, any Subscriber requests after May 1, 2010 to be placed on the \"Do Not Mail\" list will only be effective for the 12-month period following such request. If Subscribers wish to continue to remain on the \"Do Not Mail\" list, Subscribers will need to make another request upon the expiration of the previous request. Please also note, \"Do Not Call\" and \"Do Not Mail\" requests may take up to thirty (30) days to become effective.\r\n\r\nIf you do not wish to receive display ads for our products and services shown to you on other websites and web services across the internet, you may opt out of most such advertising by going to the following websites, operated by industry trade and self-regulatory organizations: http://networkadvertising.org/choices (operated by the Network Advertising Initiative) or http://www.aboutads.info (operated by the Digital Advertising Alliance).\r\n\r\nWe also offer you a choice as to whether you wish to receive targeted third party advertising/promotional messages delivered to your set-top box, certain other IP-enabled device applications, or on third party websites. To exercise this choice, please visit http://optimum.net/privacy-preferences. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Altice provides Subscribers with the opportunity to restrict the use of program and content recommendations in association with certain Altice services, including our recommendations features and functions, by visiting http://optimum.net/privacy-preferences. \r\n\r\nPlease note, your opt-out preferences may not take effect immediately and do not retroactively apply to existing advertising/promotional messages or campaigns.\r\n \r\nF. Special Rules About Telephone-Related Information\r\nUnder federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of a category of telephone-related information known as \"customer proprietary network information\" or \"CPNI.\" Altice restricts access to your telephone CPNI. For example, call detail records, which contain information about the calls you make are available online. In order to access call detail records online, you must have an Optimum ID and password. All other telephone CPNI is restricted by requiring a password and/or by requiring that you provide certain non-public verification information over the phone to confirm your identity. A written request may also be used to obtain your telephone CPNI. You must send the written request to Optimum Voice at 6 Corporate Center Drive, Melville New York 11747, Attn. Shared Services - CDR. All requests will be verified.\r\nAltice also restricts the use of your telephone CPNI. Unless we have your appropriate consent, Altice does not share your telephone CPNI with non-affiliates for marketing purposes. We may, however, use telephone CPNI or share de-identified information to tailor your service and to market related Optimum Voice products and services to you.\r\n \r\nG. Our Collection and Use of Information is Subject to Legal Limitations\r\nThe Cable Act imposes limitations with respect to the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information by cable operators, unless you provide us consent to collect or disclose information in another fashion, such as by accepting this Privacy Notice as part of the sign-up process for our Covered Services. Generally speaking, cable operators may not use the cable system to collect personally identifiable information concerning subscribers without prior consent of the subscriber concerned except to obtain information necessary to render our cable service or other services to our subscribers or to detect unauthorized reception of cable communications. In addition, subject to certain specified exceptions, cable operators generally may not disclose personally identifiable information without consent of the subscriber concerned. Also, cable operators must take such actions as are necessary to prevent unauthorized access to such information by a person other than the subscriber or cable operator. If we violate your rights, you may be entitled to bring a civil action in a federal court, which may award actual, liquidated, and punitive damages, fees and costs, and other remedies that may be available. In addition, if anyone asks us to provide information about you, we may have to notify you, and you may have the right to appear in court.\r\n \r\nH. How We Protect Subscriber Information\r\nWe employ physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Subscriber Information. For example, we utilize secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect certain information you provide to us; employ verification measures to protect e-mail during delivery; maintain certain subscriber databases in restricted areas; and secure the content by use of firewalls and other security methods. We also limit access to databases containing subscribers' Personally Identifiable Information to specifically authorized employees and agents and other parties identified in the disclosure section above.\r\nDespite these measures, we do not guarantee the security of information stored in our database or that unauthorized parties will not intercept information you send or receive over the Internet. As a shared resource, the Internet subjects our services and you to the risk of unauthorized access to files and data, even when security measures are implemented. If you use Altice's high-speed Internet service such as Optimum Online, to send, receive or post personal or confidential information, you do so at your own risk.\r\n \r\nI. Questions About This Notice\r\nIf you have any questions about our privacy protections, notices and policies, please write to us at:\r\n\r\nAltice\r\nAttn. Shared Services Dept\r\n200 Jericho Quadrangle\r\nJericho, NY 11753\r\n\r\n J. Updates To This Notice\r\nWe will review this privacy notice periodically as we deem appropriate and when we change or update Covered Services. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the revised notice on our Optimum website or by written or electronic correspondence. Your use of the Covered Service(s) following the notice of a revised notice constitutes your acceptance of the revised privacy notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffective October 15, 2018\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUDDENLINK COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY POLICY\r\n\r\nSuddenlink is committed to protecting the privacy of our Customers and Website Users.

We use the Information we collect for legitimate business activities, including: to provide and improve our Services; to communicate with you; to generate De-identified Information, and for advertising, marketing and recommendations purposes.  \r\n\r\na. \tTo Provide and Improve Our Services. We use the Information we collect, including PII, to conduct business activities such as account administration, service provisioning, operations, billings and collections, marketing, analytics, customer service, technical support, network performance management, and fraud prevention. These purposes may specifically include:\r\n\r\n\testablishing your account; \r\n\tmeasuring credit and payment risk; \r\n\tfacilitating billing and collections functions and obligations (including any reporting to credit bureaus or collection agencies to obtain payment for our billed products and services); \r\n\tauthenticating access to your account; \r\n\taccount administration; \r\n\tservice delivery and optimization; \r\n\tmaintenance and operations, including management of the network and devices supporting our service and our systems; \r\n\ttechnical support; \r\n\thardware and software upgrades for devices and systems; \r\n\tunderstanding the use of the Service; \r\n\timproving our Website and Services and identifying and developing new features, products and services;\r\n\tproviding you with programming, services and advertising that are of enhanced value and interest to you;\r\n\tcustomer service, including processing and responding to your inquiries and troubleshooting; \r\n\tinternal analytics and reporting;\r\n\tprotecting our rights, personnel and property; \r\n\tenforcing our legal rights, including under the Residential Services Agreement or Commercial Services Agreement (as applicable); and\r\n\tcomplying with applicable law. \r\n\r\nb. \tTo Communicate With You. We use the Information we collect to deliver and personalize our communications with you. For example, we may use the PII you provide us to inform you of Service updates or the status of a service request or outages, as well as to invite you to participate in a survey, to collect amounts you owe, or in connection with other activities related to the Services or your account.\r\n\r\nc. \tTo Generate De-identified Information. We may use Customers’ PII to generate De-identified Information that cannot be reasonably linked to the Customer individually. Subject to Section 8 below, our collection, use, and disclosure of De-identified Information is subject to our discretion and is not subject to any of the restrictions in this Policy. For example, we may use De-identified Information for purposes such as measurement of viewership of programming and advertising, creation of tuning and viewing cohorts or segmentations, providing targeted content for our services or facilitating delivery of relevant third party advertising/promotional messages through our Services and on third party websites and other platforms. However, we do provide you with the choice to opt out of the use of your De-identified Information to facilitate Targeted Third Party Advertising (see Section 5.c below).\r\n\r\nd. \tTo Provide Advertising, Marketing and Recommendations. We use the Information we collect about Customers and their use of the Services and cable system to make program and content recommendations, to send promotional communications about the Services or other Altice product and service offerings, and for other First Party Advertising and Third Party Advertising purposes. These promotional communications and advertisements may be directed to you because you subscribe to the Services, because of the way you use the Services, or because you live in a certain geographic area, or may be based on demographic and interest information that we collect or obtain from other sources. For example, we may use Information to facilitate the display of First Party Advertising to you on other websites, mobile applications and devices. When we do this, we may provide service providers with access to certain PII in order to facilitate the creation of de-identified audiences (for example, based on IP address, cookie ID, device ID or other persistent identifiers) and the placement of Targeted First Party Advertising. If you are a Video or internet subscriber, we may also use these service providers to create similar audiences based in part on de-identified viewing or usage data and/or the IP address(es) we assign to facilitate the sending of Targeted Third Party Advertising that we think may be of interest to you. Our sharing of information to facilitate Targeted Third Party Advertising is described in Sections 4.b and 4.c below. You can opt out of certain marketing messages as outlined in Section 5 below. \r\n\r\ne. \tCPNI Data. Our use of VoIP Customers’ CPNI data is limited as described in Section 7.b below.\r\n\r\nf. \tGeolocation Data. We use service address, device and/or access point location data for a variety of purposes, including to facilitate emergency services, provide our services and our location-based applications and services. Where we offer our own location-based applications, we provide you with notice and choice about whether specific location-tracking features available on your device are turned on. Many types of wireless applications and services use device location data, including applications provided by other companies and wireless device operating systems. When you are considering new third party applications or services, you should carefully review the location-based services' or application providers' privacy policies to learn how they collect and use your information.\r\n\r\ng.\tRetention of Information. We generally keep some or all Customer and User Information for as long as necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was collected or other business, tax or legal purposes. When information is no longer needed or required to be maintained, we destroy or de-identify it in accordance with our internal policies. If you are a California resident (“CA Resident”) you have the right to request the deletion of the personal information we collect from you subject to certain exceptions as described in Section 8 below.\r\n\r\n4. \tWHEN AND WITH WHOM WE SHARE INFORMATION. \r\n\r\na.\tGeneral Sharing Policy. Except as set forth below, Suddenlink will not share or disclose Customers’ PII to a third party unless it is necessary for us to render our Services or conduct a legitimate business activity related to the Services we provide to you, or the Customer provides appropriate consent in advance.\r\n\r\nb. \tService Providers. We sometimes provide access to Information, including PII, to third party service providers to assist us in providing Services or for other legitimate business purposes, including those described in Section 3.a. For example, we may provide access to certain Information to companies providing services to us, including installation and repair, billing, call center, sales and marketing, market research, fulfilment, mailings, data storage, data scrubbing, data analytics and processing, bill collection, auditing and accounting, credit reporting, and legal services. We may also provide access to third party data service providers who assist us in facilitating or providing targeted advertising by generating De-identified Information based on your PII. These Service Providers are authorized to use your PII only as necessary to provide these services on our behalf. We may also disclose PII to credit reporting agencies.\r\n\r\nc. \tAltice Affiliated Businesses. We may share Information, including PII, with Altice affiliates that assist us in providing Services, such as Altice Technical Services, or that offer products and services under other brands, such as Altice Mobile, Cheddar and Optimum. We do this either to provide and improve our Services as described in Section 3.a above or to better enable those affiliates to provide their products and services to you. For example, if you are an existing or potential Altice Mobile customer we may share account information in order to confirm your eligibility for that service and/or make it easier to provide that service to you. We may also share your information with other Altice affiliates for First Party Marketing purposes, provided that any required consent (such as with respect to the use of CPNI data) is obtained. \r\n\r\nWe may also share Customer and Website User Information, including PII, with a successor company or other Altice entities in the event of a merger, acquisition or sale of all, or components of, our business. \r\n\r\nOur affiliate a4 works with third party advertisers to run cross-platform (tv, computer, tablet, mobile device) Targeted Advertising campaigns. We may share De-identified Information, including device IDs, IP addresses or other unique IDs, with a4 to facilitate the creation of audience segments to receive this Targeted Third Party Advertising and for other advertising and marketing purposes.\r\n\r\nd. \tAccount Owners and Users. We may disclose any information about a Customer’s account and use of the Services and their features to the primary account owner after appropriate authentication. The primary account owner may also authorize other users to access information on the account, and that may include data about you and your use of the Services.\r\n\r\ne.\tMailing List Information. If you subscribe to a non-voice Service offered over our cable system (e.g., Video or Internet), we may rely on a special provision of law that allows us to disclose mailing-list information about you to marketing organizations, programmers and other businesses. Mailing-list information includes your name, addresses, and the non-voice services to which you subscribe (for example, basic tier, HBO). You can opt-out of our disclosure of mailing list information as described in Section 5.d below.  \r\n\r\nf. \tCPNI and Subscriber List Information. If you subscribe to our VoIP service, applicable regulations allow us to disclose subscriber list information. For example, we may give your name, address, and number to organizations who publish phone directories or who provide 411 services or similar public services. We may transmit your name and number so that the person you call can see such information on his or her Caller ID. Certain procedures allow you to block transmission of Caller ID information. You may contact us to obtain additional information about these procedures. We may also transmit your name, number, and registered location to a public safety answering point (\"PSAP\") when you dial 911 for emergency services. Disclosure of CPNI data is subject to additional specific limitations, as described in Section 7.b below.\r\n\r\ng. \tAuthorized Parties With Your Consent. We may disclose PII about you to third parties with your consent. We may obtain your consent through a variety of channels, such as in writing, online, on your phone, when you agree to terms of service, in our stores, or implicitly, for example, when you purchase a product and ask that it be shipped to your home, thereby consenting to our disclosure of your name and address to a third party shipping company to complete delivery.\r\n\r\nh. \tThird Parties for Marketing Purposes. We do not and will not sell, license or rent Customers’ or Website Users’ PII to unaffiliated third parties without the required consent to do so. We may provide De-identified Information (which may include information about viewing habits, geolocation and system interaction) to third party advertisers, programmers audience measurement and research firms to provide more relevant programming, advertising and features, to improve the Services, to provide you with information or offers about products or services we believe may be of interest to you, or to assist third parties with media, programming and content planning, and purchasing efforts. We may also share De-identified Information or aggregate Information with third parties for other uses of their own provided they commit not to re-identify the information.  \r\n\r\ni. \tWhen Required by Law or to Protect Altice or Others. You acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve and disclose your Information, including your PII, your account information and content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:\r\n•\tcomply with legal process;\r\n•\tenforce our Terms of Service, Privacy Policies, or other contracts with you;\r\n•\trespond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties;\r\n•\trespond to your requests for customer service;\r\n•\trespond to inquiries from government agencies regarding customer-initiated complaints provided to such agencies; or\r\n•\tprotect the rights, property or personal safety of Altice, its agents and affiliates, its users and the public.\r\n\r\nWe may also disclose information to law enforcement agencies in emergency circumstances, where the disclosure of such information is consistent with the types of emergency disclosures permitted or required by law. We are required by law to report any evidence we may become aware of relating to violations of laws concerning child exploitation.\r\n\r\nIn some areas we provide home security services, including video surveillance services. We provide information to emergency responders for purposes of providing this service. As a part of these services, we may record and store video at your direction and for your use. Our employees and agents have access to recorded video, and they may view that video during installation, while troubleshooting, when performing maintenance, and/or during emergency situations (as determined by us in our reasonable discretion). \r\n\r\n5.\tCHOICES YOU HAVE TO LIMIT USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION.\r\n\r\na. \tMarketing Communications. We may send you marketing communications about Altice products or services. We allow you to limit or opt-out of some types of marketing communications. For example, you may choose not to receive promotional or marketing telephone calls or postal mailings regarding our Services by contacting us at customer.service@suddenlink.net or 888-822-5151 for placement on our “Do Not Call” list or “Do Not Mail” list. Please note, any requests to be placed on the \"Do Not Mail\" list will only be effective for the 12-month period following such request. If you wish to continue to remain on the “Do Not Mail” list, you will need to make another request upon the expiration of the previous request. Please also note, “Do Not Call” and “Do Not Mail” requests may take up to thirty (30) days to become effective.\r\n\r\nb.  \tInterest Based First Party Advertising. Some advertising that you see on the internet or in mobile applications on your devices are tailored to your interests and based on your activity online or in the mobile applications. If you do not wish to receive interest based ads for our products and services on other websites or mobile applications, you may opt out of most such advertising by going to the following websites operated by industry trade and self-regulatory organizations: http://networkadvertising.org/choices (operated by the Network Advertising Initiative) or http://www.aboutads.info (operated by the Digital Advertising Alliance).\r\n\r\nc.  \tTargeted Third Party Advertising. We offer you the ability to opt-out of receiving Targeted Third Party Advertising based on your Information or use of the Services as described in Section 3.d. To opt-out, utilizing the email address associated with your Suddenlink Internet account, please email privacyoptout@suddenlink.com with the subject line “OPT-OUT” and in the body of the email, please include the account holder’s name, account number, and billing address. \r\n\r\nd. \tMailing List Information. If you do not want us to disclose mailing list information on the basis of the provision of law described in Section 4.e above, please contact us at customer.service@suddenlink.net or 888-822-5151. After your opt-out takes effect, we will limit our disclosures of your mailing list information to the other disclosures described in this Privacy Policy, which are permitted by other provisions of law.\r\n\r\ne. \tAccess. You may check the accuracy of your personally identifiable information in your account by contacting a Customer Care representative at 888-822-5151. In most cases, the personally identifiable information contained in these records consists solely of billing and account information. You may also examine the records containing your personally identifiable information at your local Suddenlink office during business hours and at your own cost and upon reasonable prior notice to us. If you wish to examine these records, please contact the Suddenlink office noted on your billing statement. If your review reveals an error in our records, Suddenlink will correct it. You will need to provide proper identification and will only be permitted to examine records that contain Personally Identifiable Information about your account and no other account.\r\n\r\nPlease note, your opt-out preferences may not take effect immediately and do not apply retroactively.  \r\n\r\n6. \tHOW WE SECURE YOUR INFORMATION. We employ physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Customers’ Information. For example, we utilize secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect certain information you provide to us; employ verification measures to protect e-mail during delivery; maintain certain Customer databases in restricted areas; and secure the content by use of firewalls and other security methods. We also limit access to databases containing Customers' PII to specifically authorized employees and agents and other parties identified in Section 4 above. Despite these measures, we do not guarantee the security of information stored in our databases or that unauthorized parties will not intercept information you send or receive over the Internet. As a shared resource, the Internet subjects our services and you to the risk of unauthorized access to files and data, even when security measures are implemented. If you use the Suddenlink Internet service to send, receive or post personal or confidential information, you do so at your own risk. Since we cannot control websites or Internet services operated by third parties that you may visit through use of our Services, we recommend that you review the terms of service and privacy policies of those websites and services.\r\n\r\n7.  \tSPECIAL RULES AND RIGHTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW. \r\n\r\na.\tCable Act and PII. The Cable Act imposes limitations with respect to the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information by cable operators, unless you provide us consent to collect or disclose information in another fashion, such as by accepting this Privacy Policy as part of the sign-up process for our Services. Generally speaking, cable operators may not use the cable system to collect personally identifiable information concerning subscribers without their prior consent except to obtain information necessary to render our cable service or other services to our subscribers or to detect unauthorized reception of cable communications. In addition, subject to certain specified exceptions, cable operators generally may not disclose personally identifiable information without consent of the subscriber concerned. Also, cable operators must take such actions as are necessary to prevent unauthorized access to such information by a person other than the subscriber or cable operator. If we violate your rights, you may be entitled to bring a civil action in a federal court, which may award actual, liquidated, and punitive damages, fees and costs, and other remedies that may be available. In addition, if anyone asks us to provide information about you, we may have to notify you, and you may have the right to appear in court.\r\n\r\nb.\t  Communications Act and CPNI. Under federal law, you have a right as a VoIP Customer, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI data. We restrict access to your CPNI. For example, call detail records, which contain information about the calls you make are available online. In order to access call detail records online, you must have a Suddenlink ID and password. All other CPNI is restricted by requiring a password and/or by requiring that you provide certain non-public verification information over the phone to confirm your identity. A written request may also be used to obtain your CPNI. You must send the written request to Suddenlink at 200 Jericho Quadrangle, Jericho, NY 11753, Attn. Shared Services - CDR. All requests will be verified.\r\n\r\nAltice also restricts the use of your telephone CPNI. Unless we have your appropriate consent, Altice does not share your telephone CPNI with non-affiliates for marketing purposes. We may, however, use telephone CPNI or share de-identified information to tailor your service and to market related Optimum Voice products and services to you.\r\n\r\n8. \tYOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS. The California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100-1798.199, requires that “Businesses” (as defined in the CCPA) provide CA Residents with information regarding the personal information collected, disclosed and sold about them. The CCPA definition of personal information (“CA Personal Information”) is broader than the definition of PII in Section 1.i above and may include information we collect when you use the Services or visit the Website, such as IP addresses, cookie IDs, and device IDs, to the extent such information is reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to a particular consumer or household. We consider ourselves to be a Business with respect to the CA Personal Information we collect from Subscribers who are CA Residents when they provide it to us, use our Services, or visit our Website as described in Section 2 above. We also consider ourselves to be a Business with respect to certain licensed demographic data we collect from third parties (see Section 2.c) as well as information we collect from non-Customer Users of the Website (see Section 2.d). The CCPA provides CA Residents the right to know about the CA Personal Information collected, disclosed or sold about them by us as a Business, the right to request that we delete their CA Personal Information (subject to certain exceptions), and the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for exercising any of these privacy rights. \r\n\r\na. \tCollection of CA Personal Information. Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.140(o) contains a list of categories of CA Personal Information. The table below lists the categories of CA Personal Information we have collected about Customers or Website Users who are CA Residents in the preceding 12 months, the categories of sources of that information, the business or commercial purposes for which the information was collected, and the categories of third parties with whom it was shared.\r\n\r\nCategory of CA Personal Information \tInformation Collected and Categories of Sources\tBusiness or Commercial Purpose for Collection\tCategories of Third Parties With Whom CA Personal Information Was Shared\r\nIdentifiers \tInformation you provide, such as name, contact information and personal identifiers (see § 2.a)\r\n\r\nBilling and account information, such as email address, account number, account IDs (see § 2.b)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tProvide and improve Services (see § 3.a)\r\n\r\nCommunicate with you (see § 3.b)\r\n\r\nGenerate De-identified Information (see § 3.c)\r\n\r\nAdvertising and marketing (see § 3.d)\tService providers (see § 4.b)\r\n\r\nAltice affiliated businesses (see § 4.c)\r\n\r\nAccount owners/users (see § 4.d)\r\n\r\nFor Voice/Internet Customers, mailing list recipients (see § 4.e)\r\n\r\nFor voice Customers, subscriber list recipients and PSAPs (see § 4.f)\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies/others in response to legal process (court order, subpoena, etc.) (see § 4.i)\r\nCustomer Records (Personal Information Under Cal Civ.

The CCPA distinguishes between the disclosure of CA Personal Information for business or commercial purposes and the “sale” of CA Personal Information. We consider our sharing of CA Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy and summarized in the chart above to the disclosure of such information for business or commercial purposes. We do not sell Customers’ or Website Users’ CA Personal Information.\r\n\r\nc. \tRight to Know and Deletion Requests. CA Residents have the right to request that we disclose the categories and/or specific information of CA Personal Information we have collected about them, the categories of sources of that information, the business or commercial purposes for which the information was collected, and the categories of third parties with whom it was shared (“Right to Know Requests”). \r\nCA Residents also have the right to request that we delete the CA Personal Information that we have collected from them subject to certain exceptions, such as maintaining the information to continue to provide our services (“Deletion Requests”).\r\nWe will only be able to honor Right to Know and Deletion Requests for CA Residents whose identities we can verify, which is limited to current or former Customers. We have no reasonable way to verify the identity of a CA Resident Website User who is not a current or former Customer, as the CA Personal Information we collect about these Users as a Business is limited to the information automatically collected on the Website as described in Section 2.d.  \r\n\r\nCA Residents who are existing or former Customers, or their authorized agents (see Section 8.d below), may submit Right to Know and Deletion Requests by downloading, printing and completing the online form available here and emailing the completed form to us at CCPA@alticeusa.com, or may contact us at 1-806-418-8888. \r\n\r\nd. \tAuthorized Agents. CA Residents may use an authorized agent to submit a Right to Know or Deletion Request on their behalf provided that the CA Resident gives the authorized agent written permission to do so, the authorized agent submits verifiable proof of such written permission and their identity to us, and the CA Resident subsequently verifies to us that permission has been provided.  In the event a request is received by an authorized agent, we will follow up with both the agent and CA Resident seeking additional information to verify identities and ensure that a signed Authorized Agent permission form (available here) has been completed and submitted.  \r\n\r\ne. \tCCPA Questions.  If you are a CA Resident or authorized agent with questions regarding your rights under the CCPA you may contact us at CCPA@alticeusa.com or at the mailing address set forth in Section 10 below.\r\n\r\nf.\tShine the Light Law (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83). A separate California law requires that we provide CA Residents with notice and choice with respect to the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. If you request it, we will provide you with a notice of your right to prevent sharing of your personal information as well as a cost-free means of doing so. You may request such a notice by submitting a written request to customer.service@suddenlink.net specifying that you seek your “California Customer Choice Notice.” Please allow thirty days for a response.\r\n\r\n9. \tCHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. We may change this Policy at any time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the revised Policy on the website. We encourage you to periodically review the Policy to inform yourself of any changes. The revised Policy will be effective on the date it is posted unless the revised notice states otherwise. You understand and agree that, if you use the Mobile Service after the effective date of the updated Policy, Altice will consider your use as acceptance of the updated Policy. If we make material changes that will result in a new use, disclosure, or permission of access to PII previously collected, we will obtain your appropriate consent before implementing such change as required by applicable law.\r\n\r\n10. \tHOW TO CONTACT US.

This notice is designed to give you a general understanding of how Altice protects your privacy in connection with our residential and business cable television services (such as Optimum TV), high-speed Internet services (such as Optimum Online), voice services (such as Optimum Voice) and any other cable service or communication service we may provide to you using our cable system as such services are defined by applicable law, as well as Optimum.net (together \"Covered Services\").\r\nThis notice does not generally cover other Altice websites, such as Optimum.com, interactive television channels, or other products or services that may be accessed through Covered Services. These other services are governed by separate privacy notices, which we encourage you to review when using these other services to understand how your information is handled. This notice only covers Altice's Optimum services and does not cover Altice's Lightpath and Suddenlink service.\r\n\r\nIn this notice, \"we\" and \"Altice\" refer to CSC Holdings, LLC (formerly CSC Holdings, Inc.) and/or any affiliate of CSC Holdings, LLC that owns, operates, or provides Covered Services.\r\n \r\nA. Information We Collect and Receive, and How We Collect It\r\nIn connection with the initiation and ongoing provisioning of Covered Services, as well as with our ongoing efforts to improve the quality and value of the Covered Services, we may maintain certain information related to you that you provide to us or that we collect using the cable systems (\"Subscriber Information\"). Certain Subscriber Information may be personally identifiable (\"Personally Identifiable Information\"). Personally Identifiable Information does not include, among other things, any aggregate data or other data which does not identify a particular person or information which by itself does not identify a particular person, such as your zip code, gender, IP Address, MAC address or other equipment identifiers, or certain other unique numbers or codes. We may collect Personally Identifiable Information using the cable system in order to obtain information necessary to render our cable service or other services to our subscribers or to detect unauthorized reception of cable communications, as well as for other purposes described in this notice.\r\n\r\nWhen You Interact With Us: Subscriber Information may include information which you provide to us such as your name, service address, billing address, work address, email address, home telephone number, work telephone number, mobile phone number, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, credit card number and expiration date, bank account number, and other financial information. In addition, as part of our normal course of business, we generate and maintain billing and account information such as your billing history, the services to which you have subscribed, your payment history, your maintenance and repair history, the kind, location, configuration, device identifiers, MAC, and IP addresses of equipment (including TV sets, set-top boxes, CableCARDs, modems, telephones, IP enabled devices) connected to our facilities. For customer services purposes, we also may keep copies of correspondence concerning your account or records of complaints or inquiries that may be made about our service. In addition, we may sometimes collect responses to customer satisfaction surveys for analytics and research purposes. We may also collect information that helps us detect unauthorized use of our services.\r\n\r\nWhen You Use Our Services: We may also collect service-specific Subscriber Information depending on the Covered Services to which you subscribe. For example:\r\n•\tOptimum Voice. If you are a subscriber of a covered Altice voice service such as Optimum Voice (which is an interconnected Voice-over-Internet Protocol \"VoIP\" service), we may collect customer proprietary network information (\"CPNI\"). CPNI is information that relates to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of use of an interconnected VoIP service or telecommunications service subscribed to by any customer, and that is made available to the carrier by the customer solely by virtue of the provider-customer relationship; and information contained in the bills pertaining to interconnected VoIP service, telephone exchange service or telephone toll service received by a customer. CPNI does not include the \"subscriber list information\" we collect, which includes your name, address, and telephone number that has been published or accepted for publication in any directory format, as well as (for business listings) your primary advertising classifications. The disclosure and use of CPNI is subject to specialized restrictions as described in Section F below.\r\n•\tInternet Service, including Optimum Online and Optimum WiFi Hotspots. If you subscribe to a covered Altice high-speed Internet service such as Optimum Online, we may collect broadband data, including information regarding geolocation and/or service usage, including bandwidth used (including for specific third party website traffic and app usage), system and connection performance, browsers used, device type, device identifiers, dates and times of access, and internet resource requests/browsing history (such as a log of visited URLs). We may maintain records of Internet Protocol addresses and email accounts that we assign to you, as well as any violations or alleged violations of applicable terms and conditions of usage. Additional information about our privacy practices specific to our high-speed Internet service, including more detail regarding data collection, can be found in the Additional Privacy Information for High Speed Internet Service.\r\n•\tOptimum TV. If you are a digital cable television subscriber, we may also automatically collect information about your use of our systems, such as changing your television channel, reviewing listings in an electronic program guide, using your remote, interacting with your DVR, ordering or viewing on-demand programming, engaging in other interactive programming features, or when using the Optimum App (such as audio files when using voice-based search) or other similar IP enabled device applications. We collect this information for purposes and uses including billing, service optimization, troubleshooting and customer service, operations, programming, including VOD, pay-per-view, program and content recommendation features and functions, advertising targeting and optimization, data analytics, e-Bill, operation of certain Optimum Select services, and as otherwise described in the following section.\r\n \r\nInformation Provided to Us by Third Parties: Sometimes, we also obtain additional information from publicly available sources such as research consultants, data service providers, and marketing firms to supplement the information we collect from you. From time to time, we may combine this publicly available information with information that we collect from you. In addition, we may also obtain information from our business partners and/or their service providers or clients, to assist with data collection, reporting and ad response measurement, as well as to assist with delivering and analyzing the performance of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. The types of information that we may receive from third parties includes, but is not limited to demographic data (including, but not limited to gender or age range) and interest data (including, but not limited to demonstrated interest in or interaction with a particular product/website).\r\n\r\nWe participate in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op to better understand how you use our website and apps across the various devices you use, and to deliver services and advertising that are of an enhanced value and interest to you. Click here to learn more about how Adobe does this and to manage your choices relating to this linking of devices.\r\n\r\nInformation Collected on Our Websites: We collect data about visitors to our subscriber website, Optimum.net, using automated means such as cookies, clear GIFs, and passive automatic electronic collection, which are described in more detail in our Website Privacy Notice. We may work with third-party companies to engage in such collection.\r\nB. How We Use Subscriber Information\r\nWe use Subscriber Information, including Personally Identifiable Information, to conduct business activities such as account administration, service provisioning, operations, billings and collections, marketing, analytics, customer service, technical support, manage network performance, and for fraud prevention. These purposes may specifically include the use of Personally Identifiable Information to:\r\n•\thelp us provide high-quality, competitively-priced Covered Services in an efficient manner;\r\n•\tensure that you receive the services to which you have subscribed and execute requests that you make;\r\n•\tprovide you with programming, services and advertising that are of an enhanced value and interest to you;\r\n•\tfacilitate billing and collections functions and obligations (including any reporting to credit bureaus or collection agencies to obtain payment for our billed products and services);\r\n•\tprovide you with accurate and high quality customer service, including responding to subscriber inquiries and troubleshooting;\r\n•\tcomply with tax obligations, accounting rules, and contractual obligations to vendors;\r\n•\tensure that you receive information about products and services that may be of interest to you;\r\n•\tensure compliance with applicable laws and the terms, conditions, notices and policies governing the Covered Services;\r\n•\tprotect our rights, such as preventing fraud, service theft, and abusive practices; and\r\n•\timprove our facilities and the services that we provide over them.\r\n \r\nWe may use Subscriber Information to generate de-identified or aggregated information - that is, data from which Personally Identifiable Information has been removed. We may also employ automated processes to generate de-identified or aggregated information from any of our Covered Services. De-identified or aggregated information does not identify you in a personal way, and our collection, use, and disclosure of de-identified or aggregate information is not subject to any of the restrictions in this notice and its use and disclosure is subject to our discretion. For example, we may use de-identified or aggregated information for purposes such as measurement of viewership of programming and advertising, creation of tuning and viewing cohorts or segmentations, providing targeted content for our services or facilitating delivery of relevant third party advertising/promotional messages through our Covered Services and on third party websites and other platforms.\r\n\r\nWe may use certain Subscriber Information, including viewing activity and other use of the cable system (as described in Section A above), broadband data (also as described in Section A) and Personally Identifiable Information, for marketing or analytics purposes. Such use may include facilitating display ads for our products and services shown to you on other websites and web services across the Internet. When we do this, we may provide third party service providers with access to certain of your Personally Identifiable Information in order to place de-identified coded data into cookies on your browser (or employ similar technology), and to provide you with more relevant offers and updates through display media. \r\n\r\nIf you are a digital cable television or internet subscriber, we may use de-identified viewing activity or usage data that we have collected and/or IP address(es) we assign to subscribers, in combination with data we receive or license from third parties (such as data collected when you visit or log in to third party websites or engage in offline transactions), to deliver television and digital ads to audiences based on demographic information (e.g., gender or household size) and/or interest information (e.g., travel or sports) across different screens and platforms. We may also work with third party data and service providers who de-identify data we hold to facilitate this advertising and link it to the above third party data. You can opt out of certain marketing messages as described in the Access and Choice section below.\r\n\r\nOur use of certain Subscriber Information associated with voice service however, is limited as described in Section F below.\r\n\r\nIndividuals who may be authorized to have access to Personally Identifiable Information include our employees, agents, and affiliates within our family of affiliated businesses though we seek to limit access to individuals on a need to know basis. Sometimes, we may provide access to certain Personally Identifiable Information to select third parties to assist us in providing services or for other legitimate business purposes. For example, we may provide access to certain information to companies providing services to us, including installation and repair, billing, call center, sales and marketing, market research, fulfilment, mailings, data storage, data scrubbing, data analytics and processing, bill collection, auditing and accounting, credit reporting, and legal services. We may also provide access to third parties who assist us in providing targeted advertising and audience analysis services, opportunities and initiatives. We will provide access to CPNI (a term described in Section A above) for use in sales and marketing only to our agents and affiliates. The frequency of such access depends on our business needs.\r\n\r\nGeolocation Data: We use service address, device and/or access point location data for a variety of purposes, including to facilitate emergency services, provide our services, our and third-party location-based applications and services including, but not limited to, navigation, promotional offers, weather services and the like and deliver location-based or other advertising that may be of interest to you and/or for reporting and ad response measurement. Where we offer our own location-based applications, we provide you with notice and choice about whether specific location-tracking features available on your device are turned on.\r\n\r\nMany types of wireless applications and services use device location data, including applications provided by other companies and wireless device operating systems. When you are considering new third party applications or services, you should carefully review the location-based services' or application providers' privacy policies to learn how they collect and use your information.\r\nC. When We Disclose Subscriber Information\r\nExcept as set forth below, Altice will not disclose Personally Identifiable Information to third parties unless:\r\n•\tit is necessary for us to render our Covered Services or conduct a legitimate business activity related to our Covered Services;\r\n•\tor you provide appropriate consent in advance.\r\n \r\nIf you subscribe to a non-voice Covered Service, we may rely on a special provision of law that allows us to disclose mailing-list information about you to marketing organizations, programmers and other businesses. Mailing-list information includes your name, addresses, and the non-voice services to which you subscribe (for example, basic tier, HBO). IF YOU DO NOT WANT US TO DISCLOSE MAILING-LIST INFORMATION ABOUT YOU ON THE BASIS OF THAT PROVISION OF LAW, PLEASE CALL US AT 1-888-425-2089. Please note, your opt-out preferences may not take effect immediately and cannot be applied retroactively. After your opt-out takes effect, we will limit our disclosures of your mailing-list information to the other disclosures described in this notice, which are permitted by other provisions of law.\r\n\r\nIf you subscribe to a covered Altice voice service such as Optimum Voice, applicable regulations allow us to disclose subscriber list information. For example, we may give your name, address, and number to organizations who publish phone directories or who provide 411 services or similar public services. We may transmit your name and number so that the person you call can see such information on his or her Caller ID. Certain procedures allow you to block transmission of Caller ID information. You may contact us to obtain additional information about these procedures. We may also transmit your name, number, and registered location to a public safety answering point (\"PSAP\") when you dial 911 for emergency services. Disclosure of CPNI data is subject to additional specific limitations, as described in Section F below.\r\n\r\nWe may also provide your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties when you expressly consent to such disclosure, such as when you interact or make purchases from third party vendors who utilize Optimum technology or request information from third parties through certain interactive channels.\r\n\r\nWe may furnish certain de-identified information, on either an aggregate or non-aggregate basis, (which may include information about viewing habits, geolocation and system interaction) to third parties, such as advertisers and programmers, for purposes that may include but not be limited to providing you with more relevant programming, advertising and features, increasing the value of the Covered Services, providing you with information or offers about products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, or assisting third parties with media, programming and content planning and purchasing efforts. Likewise, if you are a digital cable subscriber, we may work with third party data and service providers who de-identify data about you so that we may facilitate advertising based on demographic or interest-based data collected from different platforms, whether offline or online (such as information collected when you visit or log in to a website).\r\n\r\nYou acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve and disclose your Subscriber Information, including your Personally Identifiable Information, your account information and content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:\r\n•\tcomply with legal process;\r\n•\tenforce our Terms of Service, Privacy Notice(s), or other contracts with you;\r\n•\trespond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties;\r\n•\trespond to your requests for customer service;\r\n•\trespond to inquiries from government agencies regarding customer-initiated complaints provided to such agencies;\r\n•\tor protect the rights, property or personal safety of Altice, its agents and affiliates, its users and the public.\r\n \r\nWe may also disclose information to law enforcement agencies in emergency circumstances, where the disclosure of such information is consistent with the types of emergency disclosures permitted or required by law.\r\nFinally, we also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all of your Subscriber Information, including your Personally Identifiable Information, to a successor company in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all, or components, of our business.\r\nD. We May Keep Information About You for Some Time\r\nWe generally keep some or all Subscriber Information for as long as necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was collected or as required by law. When information is no longer needed or required to be maintained, we destroy it in accordance with our internal policies.\r\n \r\nE. Access and Choice\r\nYou also have the right to inspect Personally Identifiable Information that Altice has collected and maintains in connection with the provision of Covered Services to you. If you would like access to such information, please notify us in writing at the local business office specified on your service bill. We will then contact you to set up an appointment during regular business hours. Please note, Altice reserves the right to charge you its reasonable costs in connection with retrieving Subscriber Information and providing you with access thereto. In order to obtain telephone CPNI, please see Section F below.\r\n\r\nSubscribers may choose not to receive promotional or marketing telephone calls or postal mailings regarding the Covered Services by contacting us at 1-888-425-2088 for placement on Altice's \"Do Not Call\" list or by contacting us at 1-888-425-2090 for placement on Altice's \"Do Not Mail\" list. Please note, any Subscriber requests after May 1, 2010 to be placed on the \"Do Not Mail\" list will only be effective for the 12-month period following such request. If Subscribers wish to continue to remain on the \"Do Not Mail\" list, Subscribers will need to make another request upon the expiration of the previous request. Please also note, \"Do Not Call\" and \"Do Not Mail\" requests may take up to thirty (30) days to become effective.\r\n\r\nIf you do not wish to receive display ads for our products and services shown to you on other websites and web services across the internet, you may opt out of most such advertising by going to the following websites, operated by industry trade and self-regulatory organizations: http://networkadvertising.org/choices (operated by the Network Advertising Initiative) or http://www.aboutads.info (operated by the Digital Advertising Alliance).\r\n\r\nWe also offer you a choice as to whether you wish to receive targeted third party advertising/promotional messages delivered to your set-top box, certain other IP-enabled device applications, or on third party websites. To exercise this choice, please visit http://optimum.net/privacy-preferences. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Altice provides Subscribers with the opportunity to restrict the use of program and content recommendations in association with certain Altice services, including our recommendations features and functions, by visiting http://optimum.net/privacy-preferences. \r\n\r\nPlease note, your opt-out preferences may not take effect immediately and do not retroactively apply to existing advertising/promotional messages or campaigns.\r\n \r\nF. Special Rules About Telephone-Related Information\r\nUnder federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of a category of telephone-related information known as \"customer proprietary network information\" or \"CPNI.\" Altice restricts access to your telephone CPNI. For example, call detail records, which contain information about the calls you make are available online. In order to access call detail records online, you must have an Optimum ID and password. All other telephone CPNI is restricted by requiring a password and/or by requiring that you provide certain non-public verification information over the phone to confirm your identity. A written request may also be used to obtain your telephone CPNI. You must send the written request to Optimum Voice at 6 Corporate Center Drive, Melville New York 11747, Attn. Shared Services - CDR. All requests will be verified.\r\nAltice also restricts the use of your telephone CPNI. Unless we have your appropriate consent, Altice does not share your telephone CPNI with non-affiliates for marketing purposes. We may, however, use telephone CPNI or share de-identified information to tailor your service and to market related Optimum Voice products and services to you.\r\n \r\nG. Our Collection and Use of Information is Subject to Legal Limitations\r\nThe Cable Act imposes limitations with respect to the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information by cable operators, unless you provide us consent to collect or disclose information in another fashion, such as by accepting this Privacy Notice as part of the sign-up process for our Covered Services. Generally speaking, cable operators may not use the cable system to collect personally identifiable information concerning subscribers without prior consent of the subscriber concerned except to obtain information necessary to render our cable service or other services to our subscribers or to detect unauthorized reception of cable communications. In addition, subject to certain specified exceptions, cable operators generally may not disclose personally identifiable information without consent of the subscriber concerned. Also, cable operators must take such actions as are necessary to prevent unauthorized access to such information by a person other than the subscriber or cable operator. If we violate your rights, you may be entitled to bring a civil action in a federal court, which may award actual, liquidated, and punitive damages, fees and costs, and other remedies that may be available. In addition, if anyone asks us to provide information about you, we may have to notify you, and you may have the right to appear in court.\r\n \r\nH. How We Protect Subscriber Information\r\nWe employ physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Subscriber Information. For example, we utilize secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect certain information you provide to us; employ verification measures to protect e-mail during delivery; maintain certain subscriber databases in restricted areas; and secure the content by use of firewalls and other security methods. We also limit access to databases containing subscribers' Personally Identifiable Information to specifically authorized employees and agents and other parties identified in the disclosure section above.\r\nDespite these measures, we do not guarantee the security of information stored in our database or that unauthorized parties will not intercept information you send or receive over the Internet. As a shared resource, the Internet subjects our services and you to the risk of unauthorized access to files and data, even when security measures are implemented. If you use Altice's high-speed Internet service such as Optimum Online, to send, receive or post personal or confidential information, you do so at your own risk.\r\n \r\nI. Questions About This Notice\r\nIf you have any questions about our privacy protections, notices and policies, please write to us at:\r\n\r\nAltice\r\nAttn. Shared Services Dept\r\n200 Jericho Quadrangle\r\nJericho, NY 11753\r\n\r\n J. Updates To This Notice\r\nWe will review this privacy notice periodically as we deem appropriate and when we change or update Covered Services. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the revised notice on our Optimum website or by written or electronic correspondence. Your use of the Covered Service(s) following the notice of a revised notice constitutes your acceptance of the revised privacy notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffective October 15, 2018\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUDDENLINK COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY POLICY\r\n\r\nSuddenlink is committed to protecting the privacy of our Customers and Website Users.

We use the Information we collect for legitimate business activities, including: to provide and improve our Services; to communicate with you; to generate De-identified Information, and for advertising, marketing and recommendations purposes.  \r\n\r\na. \tTo Provide and Improve Our Services. We use the Information we collect, including PII, to conduct business activities such as account administration, service provisioning, operations, billings and collections, marketing, analytics, customer service, technical support, network performance management, and fraud prevention.

We use the Information we collect to deliver and personalize our communications with you. For example, we may use the PII you provide us to inform you of Service updates or the status of a service request or outages, as well as to invite you to participate in a survey, to collect amounts you owe, or in connection with other activities related to the Services or your account.\r\n\r\nc. \tTo Generate De-identified Information. We may use Customers’ PII to generate De-identified Information that cannot be reasonably linked to the Customer individually. Subject to Section 8 below, our collection, use, and disclosure of De-identified Information is subject to our discretion and is not subject to any of the restrictions in this Policy. For example, we may use De-identified Information for purposes such as measurement of viewership of programming and advertising, creation of tuning and viewing cohorts or segmentations, providing targeted content for our services or facilitating delivery of relevant third party advertising/promotional messages through our Services and on third party websites and other platforms. However, we do provide you with the choice to opt out of the use of your De-identified Information to facilitate Targeted Third Party Advertising (see Section 5.c below).\r\n\r\nd. \tTo Provide Advertising, Marketing and Recommendations. We use the Information we collect about Customers and their use of the Services and cable system to make program and content recommendations, to send promotional communications about the Services or other Altice product and service offerings, and for other First Party Advertising and Third Party Advertising purposes. These promotional communications and advertisements may be directed to you because you subscribe to the Services, because of the way you use the Services, or because you live in a certain geographic area, or may be based on demographic and interest information that we collect or obtain from other sources. For example, we may use Information to facilitate the display of First Party Advertising to you on other websites, mobile applications and devices. When we do this, we may provide service providers with access to certain PII in order to facilitate the creation of de-identified audiences (for example, based on IP address, cookie ID, device ID or other persistent identifiers) and the placement of Targeted First Party Advertising. If you are a Video or internet subscriber, we may also use these service providers to create similar audiences based in part on de-identified viewing or usage data and/or the IP address(es) we assign to facilitate the sending of Targeted Third Party Advertising that we think may be of interest to you. Our sharing of information to facilitate Targeted Third Party Advertising is described in Sections 4.b and 4.c below. You can opt out of certain marketing messages as outlined in Section 5 below. \r\n\r\ne. \tCPNI Data. Our use of VoIP Customers’ CPNI data is limited as described in Section 7.b below.\r\n\r\nf. \tGeolocation Data. We use service address, device and/or access point location data for a variety of purposes, including to facilitate emergency services, provide our services and our location-based applications and services. Where we offer our own location-based applications, we provide you with notice and choice about whether specific location-tracking features available on your device are turned on. Many types of wireless applications and services use device location data, including applications provided by other companies and wireless device operating systems. When you are considering new third party applications or services, you should carefully review the location-based services' or application providers' privacy policies to learn how they collect and use your information.\r\n\r\ng.\tRetention of Information. We generally keep some or all Customer and User Information for as long as necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was collected or other business, tax or legal purposes. When information is no longer needed or required to be maintained, we destroy or de-identify it in accordance with our internal policies. If you are a California resident (“CA Resident”) you have the right to request the deletion of the personal information we collect from you subject to certain exceptions as described in Section 8 below.\r\n\r\n4. \tWHEN AND WITH WHOM WE SHARE INFORMATION. \r\n\r\na.\tGeneral Sharing Policy. Except as set forth below, Suddenlink will not share or disclose Customers’ PII to a third party unless it is necessary for us to render our Services or conduct a legitimate business activity related to the Services we provide to you, or the Customer provides appropriate consent in advance.\r\n\r\nb. \tService Providers. We sometimes provide access to Information, including PII, to third party service providers to assist us in providing Services or for other legitimate business purposes, including those described in Section 3.a. For example, we may provide access to certain Information to companies providing services to us, including installation and repair, billing, call center, sales and marketing, market research, fulfilment, mailings, data storage, data scrubbing, data analytics and processing, bill collection, auditing and accounting, credit reporting, and legal services. We may also provide access to third party data service providers who assist us in facilitating or providing targeted advertising by generating De-identified Information based on your PII. These Service Providers are authorized to use your PII only as necessary to provide these services on our behalf. We may also disclose PII to credit reporting agencies.\r\n\r\nc. \tAltice Affiliated Businesses. We may share Information, including PII, with Altice affiliates that assist us in providing Services, such as Altice Technical Services, or that offer products and services under other brands, such as Altice Mobile, Cheddar and Optimum. We do this either to provide and improve our Services as described in Section 3.a above or to better enable those affiliates to provide their products and services to you. For example, if you are an existing or potential Altice Mobile customer we may share account information in order to confirm your eligibility for that service and/or make it easier to provide that service to you. We may also share your information with other Altice affiliates for First Party Marketing purposes, provided that any required consent (such as with respect to the use of CPNI data) is obtained. \r\n\r\nWe may also share Customer and Website User Information, including PII, with a successor company or other Altice entities in the event of a merger, acquisition or sale of all, or components of, our business. \r\n\r\nOur affiliate a4 works with third party advertisers to run cross-platform (tv, computer, tablet, mobile device) Targeted Advertising campaigns. We may share De-identified Information, including device IDs, IP addresses or other unique IDs, with a4 to facilitate the creation of audience segments to receive this Targeted Third Party Advertising and for other advertising and marketing purposes.\r\n\r\nd. \tAccount Owners and Users. We may disclose any information about a Customer’s account and use of the Services and their features to the primary account owner after appropriate authentication. The primary account owner may also authorize other users to access information on the account, and that may include data about you and your use of the Services.\r\n\r\ne.\tMailing List Information. If you subscribe to a non-voice Service offered over our cable system (e.g., Video or Internet), we may rely on a special provision of law that allows us to disclose mailing-list information about you to marketing organizations, programmers and other businesses. Mailing-list information includes your name, addresses, and the non-voice services to which you subscribe (for example, basic tier, HBO). You can opt-out of our disclosure of mailing list information as described in Section 5.d below.  \r\n\r\nf. \tCPNI and Subscriber List Information. If you subscribe to our VoIP service, applicable regulations allow us to disclose subscriber list information. For example, we may give your name, address, and number to organizations who publish phone directories or who provide 411 services or similar public services. We may transmit your name and number so that the person you call can see such information on his or her Caller ID. Certain procedures allow you to block transmission of Caller ID information. You may contact us to obtain additional information about these procedures. We may also transmit your name, number, and registered location to a public safety answering point (\"PSAP\") when you dial 911 for emergency services. Disclosure of CPNI data is subject to additional specific limitations, as described in Section 7.b below.\r\n\r\ng. \tAuthorized Parties With Your Consent. We may disclose PII about you to third parties with your consent. We may obtain your consent through a variety of channels, such as in writing, online, on your phone, when you agree to terms of service, in our stores, or implicitly, for example, when you purchase a product and ask that it be shipped to your home, thereby consenting to our disclosure of your name and address to a third party shipping company to complete delivery.\r\n\r\nh. \tThird Parties for Marketing Purposes. We do not and will not sell, license or rent Customers’ or Website Users’ PII to unaffiliated third parties without the required consent to do so. We may provide De-identified Information (which may include information about viewing habits, geolocation and system interaction) to third party advertisers, programmers audience measurement and research firms to provide more relevant programming, advertising and features, to improve the Services, to provide you with information or offers about products or services we believe may be of interest to you, or to assist third parties with media, programming and content planning, and purchasing efforts. We may also share De-identified Information or aggregate Information with third parties for other uses of their own provided they commit not to re-identify the information.  \r\n\r\ni. \tWhen Required by Law or to Protect Altice or Others. You acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve and disclose your Information, including your PII, your account information and content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:\r\n•\tcomply with legal process;\r\n•\tenforce our Terms of Service, Privacy Policies, or other contracts with you;\r\n•\trespond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties;\r\n•\trespond to your requests for customer service;\r\n•\trespond to inquiries from government agencies regarding customer-initiated complaints provided to such agencies; or\r\n•\tprotect the rights, property or personal safety of Altice, its agents and affiliates, its users and the public.\r\n\r\nWe may also disclose information to law enforcement agencies in emergency circumstances, where the disclosure of such information is consistent with the types of emergency disclosures permitted or required by law. We are required by law to report any evidence we may become aware of relating to violations of laws concerning child exploitation.\r\n\r\nIn some areas we provide home security services, including video surveillance services. We provide information to emergency responders for purposes of providing this service. As a part of these services, we may record and store video at your direction and for your use. Our employees and agents have access to recorded video, and they may view that video during installation, while troubleshooting, when performing maintenance, and/or during emergency situations (as determined by us in our reasonable discretion). \r\n\r\n5.\tCHOICES YOU HAVE TO LIMIT USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION.\r\n\r\na. \tMarketing Communications. We may send you marketing communications about Altice products or services. We allow you to limit or opt-out of some types of marketing communications. For example, you may choose not to receive promotional or marketing telephone calls or postal mailings regarding our Services by contacting us at customer.service@suddenlink.net or 888-822-5151 for placement on our “Do Not Call” list or “Do Not Mail” list. Please note, any requests to be placed on the \"Do Not Mail\" list will only be effective for the 12-month period following such request. If you wish to continue to remain on the “Do Not Mail” list, you will need to make another request upon the expiration of the previous request. Please also note, “Do Not Call” and “Do Not Mail” requests may take up to thirty (30) days to become effective.\r\n\r\nb.  \tInterest Based First Party Advertising. Some advertising that you see on the internet or in mobile applications on your devices are tailored to your interests and based on your activity online or in the mobile applications. If you do not wish to receive interest based ads for our products and services on other websites or mobile applications, you may opt out of most such advertising by going to the following websites operated by industry trade and self-regulatory organizations: http://networkadvertising.org/choices (operated by the Network Advertising Initiative) or http://www.aboutads.info (operated by the Digital Advertising Alliance).\r\n\r\nc.  \tTargeted Third Party Advertising. We offer you the ability to opt-out of receiving Targeted Third Party Advertising based on your Information or use of the Services as described in Section 3.d. To opt-out, utilizing the email address associated with your Suddenlink Internet account, please email privacyoptout@suddenlink.com with the subject line “OPT-OUT” and in the body of the email, please include the account holder’s name, account number, and billing address. \r\n\r\nd. \tMailing List Information. If you do not want us to disclose mailing list information on the basis of the provision of law described in Section 4.e above, please contact us at customer.service@suddenlink.net or 888-822-5151. After your opt-out takes effect, we will limit our disclosures of your mailing list information to the other disclosures described in this Privacy Policy, which are permitted by other provisions of law.\r\n\r\ne. \tAccess. You may check the accuracy of your personally identifiable information in your account by contacting a Customer Care representative at 888-822-5151. In most cases, the personally identifiable information contained in these records consists solely of billing and account information. You may also examine the records containing your personally identifiable information at your local Suddenlink office during business hours and at your own cost and upon reasonable prior notice to us. If you wish to examine these records, please contact the Suddenlink office noted on your billing statement. If your review reveals an error in our records, Suddenlink will correct it. You will need to provide proper identification and will only be permitted to examine records that contain Personally Identifiable Information about your account and no other account.\r\n\r\nPlease note, your opt-out preferences may not take effect immediately and do not apply retroactively.  \r\n\r\n6. \tHOW WE SECURE YOUR INFORMATION. We employ physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Customers’ Information. For example, we utilize secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect certain information you provide to us; employ verification measures to protect e-mail during delivery; maintain certain Customer databases in restricted areas; and secure the content by use of firewalls and other security methods. We also limit access to databases containing Customers' PII to specifically authorized employees and agents and other parties identified in Section 4 above. Despite these measures, we do not guarantee the security of information stored in our databases or that unauthorized parties will not intercept information you send or receive over the Internet. As a shared resource, the Internet subjects our services and you to the risk of unauthorized access to files and data, even when security measures are implemented. If you use the Suddenlink Internet service to send, receive or post personal or confidential information, you do so at your own risk. Since we cannot control websites or Internet services operated by third parties that you may visit through use of our Services, we recommend that you review the terms of service and privacy policies of those websites and services.\r\n\r\n7.  \tSPECIAL RULES AND RIGHTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW. \r\n\r\na.\tCable Act and PII. The Cable Act imposes limitations with respect to the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information by cable operators, unless you provide us consent to collect or disclose information in another fashion, such as by accepting this Privacy Policy as part of the sign-up process for our Services. Generally speaking, cable operators may not use the cable system to collect personally identifiable information concerning subscribers without their prior consent except to obtain information necessary to render our cable service or other services to our subscribers or to detect unauthorized reception of cable communications. In addition, subject to certain specified exceptions, cable operators generally may not disclose personally identifiable information without consent of the subscriber concerned. Also, cable operators must take such actions as are necessary to prevent unauthorized access to such information by a person other than the subscriber or cable operator. If we violate your rights, you may be entitled to bring a civil action in a federal court, which may award actual, liquidated, and punitive damages, fees and costs, and other remedies that may be available. In addition, if anyone asks us to provide information about you, we may have to notify you, and you may have the right to appear in court.\r\n\r\nb.\t  Communications Act and CPNI. Under federal law, you have a right as a VoIP Customer, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI data. We restrict access to your CPNI. For example, call detail records, which contain information about the calls you make are available online. In order to access call detail records online, you must have a Suddenlink ID and password. All other CPNI is restricted by requiring a password and/or by requiring that you provide certain non-public verification information over the phone to confirm your identity. A written request may also be used to obtain your CPNI. You must send the written request to Suddenlink at 200 Jericho Quadrangle, Jericho, NY 11753, Attn. Shared Services - CDR. All requests will be verified.\r\n\r\nAltice also restricts the use of your telephone CPNI. Unless we have your appropriate consent, Altice does not share your telephone CPNI with non-affiliates for marketing purposes. We may, however, use telephone CPNI or share de-identified information to tailor your service and to market related Optimum Voice products and services to you.\r\n\r\n8. \tYOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS. The California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100-1798.199, requires that “Businesses” (as defined in the CCPA) provide CA Residents with information regarding the personal information collected, disclosed and sold about them. The CCPA definition of personal information (“CA Personal Information”) is broader than the definition of PII in Section 1.i above and may include information we collect when you use the Services or visit the Website, such as IP addresses, cookie IDs, and device IDs, to the extent such information is reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to a particular consumer or household. We consider ourselves to be a Business with respect to the CA Personal Information we collect from Subscribers who are CA Residents when they provide it to us, use our Services, or visit our Website as described in Section 2 above. We also consider ourselves to be a Business with respect to certain licensed demographic data we collect from third parties (see Section 2.c) as well as information we collect from non-Customer Users of the Website (see Section 2.d). The CCPA provides CA Residents the right to know about the CA Personal Information collected, disclosed or sold about them by us as a Business, the right to request that we delete their CA Personal Information (subject to certain exceptions), and the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for exercising any of these privacy rights. \r\n\r\na. \tCollection of CA Personal Information. Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.140(o) contains a list of categories of CA Personal Information. The table below lists the categories of CA Personal Information we have collected about Customers or Website Users who are CA Residents in the preceding 12 months, the categories of sources of that information, the business or commercial purposes for which the information was collected, and the categories of third parties with whom it was shared.\r\n\r\nCategory of CA Personal Information \tInformation Collected and Categories of Sources\tBusiness or Commercial Purpose for Collection\tCategories of Third Parties With Whom CA Personal Information Was Shared\r\nIdentifiers \tInformation you provide, such as name, contact information and personal identifiers (see § 2.a)\r\n\r\nBilling and account information, such as email address, account number, account IDs (see § 2.b)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \tProvide and improve Services (see § 3.a)\r\n\r\nCommunicate with you (see § 3.b)\r\n\r\nGenerate De-identified Information (see § 3.c)\r\n\r\nAdvertising and marketing (see § 3.d)\tService providers (see § 4.b)\r\n\r\nAltice affiliated businesses (see § 4.c)\r\n\r\nAccount owners/users (see § 4.d)\r\n\r\nFor Voice/Internet Customers, mailing list recipients (see § 4.e)\r\n\r\nFor voice Customers, subscriber list recipients and PSAPs (see § 4.f)\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies/others in response to legal process (court order, subpoena, etc.) (see § 4.i)\r\nCustomer Records (Personal Information Under Cal Civ.

The CCPA distinguishes between the disclosure of CA Personal Information for business or commercial purposes and the “sale” of CA Personal Information. We consider our sharing of CA Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy and summarized in the chart above to the disclosure of such information for business or commercial purposes. We do not sell Customers’ or Website Users’ CA Personal Information.\r\n\r\nc. \tRight to Know and Deletion Requests. CA Residents have the right to request that we disclose the categories and/or specific information of CA Personal Information we have collected about them, the categories of sources of that information, the business or commercial purposes for which the information was collected, and the categories of third parties with whom it was shared (“Right to Know Requests”). \r\nCA Residents also have the right to request that we delete the CA Personal Information that we have collected from them subject to certain exceptions, such as maintaining the information to continue to provide our services (“Deletion Requests”).\r\nWe will only be able to honor Right to Know and Deletion Requests for CA Residents whose identities we can verify, which is limited to current or former Customers. We have no reasonable way to verify the identity of a CA Resident Website User who is not a current or former Customer, as the CA Personal Information we collect about these Users as a Business is limited to the information automatically collected on the Website as described in Section 2.d.  \r\n\r\nCA Residents who are existing or former Customers, or their authorized agents (see Section 8.d below), may submit Right to Know and Deletion Requests by downloading, printing and completing the online form available here and emailing the completed form to us at CCPA@alticeusa.com, or may contact us at 1-806-418-8888. \r\n\r\nd. \tAuthorized Agents. CA Residents may use an authorized agent to submit a Right to Know or Deletion Request on their behalf provided that the CA Resident gives the authorized agent written permission to do so, the authorized agent submits verifiable proof of such written permission and their identity to us, and the CA Resident subsequently verifies to us that permission has been provided.  In the event a request is received by an authorized agent, we will follow up with both the agent and CA Resident seeking additional information to verify identities and ensure that a signed Authorized Agent permission form (available here) has been completed and submitted.  \r\n\r\ne. \tCCPA Questions.  If you are a CA Resident or authorized agent with questions regarding your rights under the CCPA you may contact us at CCPA@alticeusa.com or at the mailing address set forth in Section 10 below.\r\n\r\nf.\tShine the Light Law (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83). A separate California law requires that we provide CA Residents with notice and choice with respect to the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. If you request it, we will provide you with a notice of your right to prevent sharing of your personal information as well as a cost-free means of doing so. You may request such a notice by submitting a written request to customer.service@suddenlink.net specifying that you seek your “California Customer Choice Notice.” Please allow thirty days for a response.\r\n\r\n9. \tCHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. We may change this Policy at any time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the revised Policy on the website. We encourage you to periodically review the Policy to inform yourself of any changes. The revised Policy will be effective on the date it is posted unless the revised notice states otherwise. You understand and agree that, if you use the Mobile Service after the effective date of the updated Policy, Altice will consider your use as acceptance of the updated Policy. If we make material changes that will result in a new use, disclosure, or permission of access to PII previously collected, we will obtain your appropriate consent before implementing such change as required by applicable law.\r\n\r\n10. \tHOW TO CONTACT US.
