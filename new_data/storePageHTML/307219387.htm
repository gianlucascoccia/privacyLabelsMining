        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Thanks for making BrainWave the Top-Ranked Binaural App for 11 years! * Headphones/Earbuds are required for Binaural Tones to be Effective * Affordable One-time purchase with No Subscriptions or In-App Purchases * Combine Advanced Multi-stage Binaural Programs with 5 Background Audio Modes: Ambience, Other App, Ambience + Other App, iTunes, iTunes + Ambience * Includes UI for iPhone &amp; iPad * Supports Family Share &amp; iOS Dark Mode<br />* This update improves UI responsiveness on different devices<br />* Combine Brainwaves with Ambience and Another App by selecting background mode &#39;Ambience + Other App&#39; * To use Another App for the Background Audio choose &#39;Other App&#39;. <br />* Added the ability to play and pause audio using Lock Screen and Remote Controls only when using Brainwaves with the included Ambience. <br />* When using background modes that allow other audio apps or iTunes Music to be playing Lockscreen controls will only affect iTunes or the other app.<br />* If the audio stops when the app is backgrounded or the screen locks please restart the device with a full shutdown as this is the result of low RAM memory which causes iOS to suspend background audio.<br /><br />* How it Works *<br /><br />During the entrainment process, two different carrier tones are played into the left and right ears. The frequency difference between these tones matches the brainwave frequency of the target state of mind. The listener will hear these carrier tones as an audible tone, however, when processing these two different tones the human brain will perceive the small frequency difference between the tones as an inaudible periodic beat. When exposed to this beat the listener&#39;s brainwaves will begin to synchronize with the beat frequency. What allows the human brain to perceive this beat is our directional hearing system, located in the brain stem. The brain&#39;s directional hearing system calculates frequency shifts between sound entering the left and right ear to quickly locate the direction of a sound, but when that difference is rhythmic, as with binaural tones, the brain synchronizes with the pattern. This process is more effective in the presence of background noise or ambience, which allows humans to hear and locate even subtle sounds, like an animal moving nearby in a forest that is filled with noise.<br /><br />As an example, the human ear can&#39;t directly perceive the .5 - 2 Hz Delta-wave frequencies associated with deep sleep because it is well below the human hearing range, but if you wear headphones or earbuds with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 136 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 1 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat, in this case matching a low delta wave frequency associated with sleep. As you listen, your own brainwaves will begin to match that frequency.<br /><br />* Brainwave Frequencies *<br /><br />Gamma waves (30-44 Hz):<br />Associated with high-level information processing, multi-tasking, excitement, and high energy.<br /><br />High-Beta waves (18-29 Hz):<br />Associated with mental activities such as math, planning, and design.<br /><br />Mid-Beta waves (15-17 Hz):<br />Increased problem-solving ability, focus, and alertness.<br /><br />Low-Beta waves (12-14 Hz):<br />Relaxed, yet still mentally sharp<br /><br />High-Alpha waves (10-11 Hz):<br />Relaxed, centered, tranquil<br /><br />Low-Alpha waves (8-9 Hz):<br />Relaxed, almost meditative but still aware<br /><br />Theta waves (4-7 Hz):<br />Associated with deep meditation, creativity, intuition, and dream-like states. Theta waves also occur during REM sleep and the early stages of deep, slow-wave sleep.<br /><br />Delta waves (.5-3 Hz):<br />Deep, slow-wave sleep. Slow-wave sleep allows the brain to recover from daily activities. It is important for hormonal regulation, growth, memory retention, and physical renewal.<br /><br />Warning: Do not use BrainWave while driving or operating machinery.<br />Note: If your vehicle Auto-Plays connected devices use the Ambience+Other background mode, not Ambience-Only, to prevent Lockscreen access.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I&#39;ve had this app on my phone for sometime, with the intention of using it as an aid for parasympathetic body work.  I finally started using it yesterday.  I&#39;ve been listening to it now for a few hours (Deep Relaxation with Peace background), and so far I&#39;m impressed with how well it works.  <br /><br />I typically feel overwhelmed by the numerous things that need to be accomplished, which leaves me feeling anxious and rushed.  This particular combo has really helped me to slow down today and not feel so uptight, which sadly, is not easily accomplished.  I use other modalities to shift my body into parasympathetic mode, but I can&#39;t seem to stay there. This program seems to be helping dampen down triggers that cause my body to shift into sympathetic state inappropriately.<br /><br />I look forward to trying the other programs.  I hope the results are as impressive and useful.  Even if they aren&#39;t, the results I&#39;m experiencing today made downloading this app one of the best tools I&#39;ve acquired to step away from the perpetual, health destroying, running myself ragged mindset that our culture has ingrained in us.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This thing blows my mind! The first time I used it I was like &quot;No way!&quot; As I kept using it I discovered that it is literally the only way I am able to fall asleep nights when my mind is so full of thoughts and my anxiety is running rampant! I hate the way sleep aids make me feel like I&#39;ve been run over by a freight train. I recently switched from using &quot;Deep Sleep&quot; to &quot;Dreamy Sleep&quot; and had the craziest dreams! I normally can&#39;t remember my dreams and I was actually able to recall quite a bit of them. Unfortunately last night, I dreamt that I faked the death of my dog last year and I felt like it lasted the whole night so I think I&#39;ll be switching back to &quot;Deep Sleep&quot; :( Awesome product though. My *only* complaint is that I wish there were more ambiance options or the ability to use it with Pandora. You can use your own music but I don&#39;t have much personal music on my phone so I am limited to using the app&#39;s ambiance tracks and they get old after a while. Highly recommend!</p>

It is great to get to sleep when suffering with insomnia, pain relief for fibromyalgia or migraine, force a nap when you know you will need it but can’t stop thinking, jet lag wake or sleep, tinnitus, energy meditation (ahhmaaazzzing!!!), or just quiet your ADD when you need to focus. SO MANY USES!!<br /><br />I love the ambient noise that comes with the app- especially ocean waves. Love that you can use itunes, but usually don’t find it necessary. I also love the slick looking super-intuitive dashboard.<br /><br />The only improvement it is needs better control on fade in/fade out during programs and at the end of programs. I have the fade toggles set, and only use the app’s ambient sounds,  but they are not always working properly. The abrupt stop and start is especially jarring when you are attempting deep sleep- similar to vertigo feeling as you are just falling asleep and you jump suddenly, but without the physical jump- lol. Also integrated glossary within descriptions would be awesome, eg, why gamma for this particular program or beta for that one? What does it DO? Talk nerdy to me.</p>

the app is backgrounded or the screen locks please restart the device with a full shutdown as this is the result of low RAM memory which causes iOS to suspend background audio.\n\n* How it Works *\n\nDuring the entrainment process, two different carrier tones are played into the left and right ears. The frequency difference between these tones matches the brainwave frequency of the target state of mind. The listener will hear these carrier tones as an audible tone, however, when processing these two different tones the human brain will perceive the small frequency difference between the tones as an inaudible periodic beat. When exposed to this beat the listener's brainwaves will begin to synchronize with the beat frequency. What allows the human brain to perceive this beat is our directional hearing system, located in the brain stem. The brain's directional hearing system calculates frequency shifts between sound entering the left and right ear to quickly locate the direction of a sound, but when that difference is rhythmic, as with binaural tones, the brain synchronizes with the pattern. This process is more effective in the presence of background noise or ambience, which allows humans to hear and locate even subtle sounds, like an animal moving nearby in a forest that is filled with noise.\n\nAs an example, the human ear can't directly perceive the .5 - 2 Hz Delta-wave frequencies associated with deep sleep because it is well below the human hearing range, but if you wear headphones or earbuds with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 136 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 1 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat, in this case matching a low delta wave frequency associated with sleep. As you listen, your own brainwaves will begin to match that frequency.\n\n* Brainwave Frequencies *\n\nGamma waves (30-44 Hz):\nAssociated with high-level information processing, multi-tasking, excitement, and high energy.\n\nHigh-Beta waves (18-29 Hz):\nAssociated with mental activities such as math, planning, and design.\n\nMid-Beta waves (15-17 Hz):\nIncreased problem-solving ability, focus, and alertness.\n\nLow-Beta waves (12-14 Hz):\nRelaxed, yet still mentally sharp\n\nHigh-Alpha waves (10-11 Hz):\nRelaxed, centered, tranquil\n\nLow-Alpha waves (8-9 Hz):\nRelaxed, almost meditative but still aware\n\nTheta waves (4-7 Hz):\nAssociated with deep meditation, creativity, intuition, and dream-like states. Theta waves also occur during REM sleep and the early stages of deep, slow-wave sleep.\n\nDelta waves (.5-3 Hz):\nDeep, slow-wave sleep. Slow-wave sleep allows the brain to recover from daily activities. It is important for hormonal regulation, growth, memory retention, and physical renewal.\n\nWarning: Do not use BrainWave while driving or operating machinery.\nNote: If your vehicle Auto-Plays connected devices use the Ambience+Other background mode, not Ambience-Only, to prevent Lockscreen access.","releaseDate":"2021-05-28"},{"versionDisplay":"9.0","releaseNotes":"Thanks for making BrainWave the Top-Ranked Binaural App for 11 years! * This update improves the iTunes integration and Accessibility * Headphones/Earbuds are required for Binaural Tones to be Effective * Affordable One-time purchase with No Subscriptions or In-App Purchases * Combine Advanced Multi-stage Binaural Programs with 5 Background Audio Modes: Ambience, Other App, Ambience + Other App, iTunes, iTunes + Ambience * Includes UI for iPhone \u0026 iPad * Supports Family Share \u0026 iOS 13 Dark Mode\n* Combine Brainwaves with Ambience and Another App by selecting background mode 'Ambience + Other App' * To use Another App for the Background Audio choose 'Other App'. \n* Added the ability to play and pause audio using Lock Screen and Remote Controls only when using Brainwaves with the included Ambience. \n* When using background modes that allow other audio apps or iTunes Music to be playing Lockscreen controls will only affect iTunes or the other app.\n* If the audio stops when the app is backgrounded or the screen locks please restart the device with a full shutdown as this is the result of low RAM memory which causes iOS to suspend background audio.\n\n* How it Works *\n\nDuring the entrainment process, two different carrier tones are played into the left and right ears.

The listener will hear these carrier tones as an audible tone, however, when processing these two different tones the human brain will perceive the small frequency difference between the tones as an inaudible periodic beat. When exposed to this beat the listener's brainwaves will begin to synchronize with the beat frequency. What allows the human brain to perceive this beat is our directional hearing system, located in the brain stem. The brain's directional hearing system calculates frequency shifts between sound entering the left and right ear to quickly locate the direction of a sound, but when that difference is rhythmic, as with binaural tones, the brain synchronizes with the pattern. This process is more effective in the presence of background noise or ambient sounds, which allows humans to hear and locate even subtle sounds, like an animal moving nearby in a forest that is filled with noise. It is also what allows humans to perceive the beat frequency produced by tuning forks.\n\nAs an example, the human ear can't directly perceive the .5 - 2 Hz Delta-wave frequencies associated with deep sleep because it is well below the human hearing range, but if you wear headphones or earbuds with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 136 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 1 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat, in this case matching a low delta wave frequency associated with sleep. As you listen, your own brainwaves will begin to match that frequency.\n\n* Brainwave Frequencies *\nDifferent states of mind will display a dominant frequency, but all brainwaves are present in a mix at all times.\n\nGamma waves (30-44 Hz):\nAssociated with high-level information processing, multi-tasking, excitement, and high energy.\n\nHigh-Beta waves (18-29 Hz):\nAssociated with mental activities such as math, planning, and design.\n\nMid-Beta waves (15-17 Hz):\nIncreased problem-solving ability, focus, and alertness.\n\nLow-Beta waves (12-14 Hz):\nRelaxed, yet still mentally sharp\n\nHigh-Alpha waves (10-11 Hz):\nRelaxed, centered, tranquil\n\nLow-Alpha waves (8-9 Hz):\nRelaxed, almost meditative but still aware\n\nTheta waves (4-7 Hz):\nAssociated with deep meditation, creativity, intuition, and dream-like states. Theta waves also occur during REM sleep and the early stages of deep, slow-wave sleep.\n\nDelta waves (.5-3 Hz):\nDeep, slow-wave sleep. Slow-wave sleep allows the brain to recover from daily activities. It is important for hormonal regulation, growth, memory retention, and physical renewal.\n","releaseDate":"2019-10-04"},{"versionDisplay":"8.1.2","releaseNotes":"Thanks for making BrainWave the #1 Brainwave Entrainment app in the App Store! \n* Headphones or Earbuds must be worn for Binaural Tones to be Effective. * To combine Audio from Another App with Brainwaves and Ambience select Background Mode #5 on the Background Settings, 'Ambience + Other App'.  * To use another app for the background audio choose Background Mode #4, 'Other App'.\n* If the audio stops when the app is backgrounded or the screen locks please restart the device with a full shutdown as this is the result of low RAM memory which causes iOS to suspend background audio.\n* Added the ability to play and pause audio using Lock Screen and Remote Controls *only* when using Brainwaves with the included Ambience.

I finally started using it yesterday.  I've been listening to it now for a few hours (Deep Relaxation with Peace background), and so far I'm impressed with how well it works.  \n\nI typically feel overwhelmed by the numerous things that need to be accomplished, which leaves me feeling anxious and rushed.  This particular combo has really helped me to slow down today and not feel so uptight, which sadly, is not easily accomplished.  I use other modalities to shift my body into parasympathetic mode, but I can't seem to stay there. This program seems to be helping dampen down triggers that cause my body to shift into sympathetic state inappropriately.\n\nI look forward to trying the other programs.  I hope the results are as impressive and useful.  Even if they aren't, the results I'm experiencing today made downloading this app one of the best tools I've acquired to step away from the perpetual, health destroying, running myself ragged mindset that our culture has ingrained in us.","title":"I'll Be Using This App Often.","userName":"ddp1966"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1359655779","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2016-04-07T03:02:23Z","rating":5,"review":"This thing blows my mind!

I hate the way sleep aids make me feel like I've been run over by a freight train. I recently switched from using \"Deep Sleep\" to \"Dreamy Sleep\" and had the craziest dreams! I normally can't remember my dreams and I was actually able to recall quite a bit of them. Unfortunately last night, I dreamt that I faked the death of my dog last year and I felt like it lasted the whole night so I think I'll be switching back to \"Deep Sleep\" :( Awesome product though. My *only* complaint is that I wish there were more ambiance options or the ability to use it with Pandora.

I have the fade toggles set, and only use the app’s ambient sounds,  but they are not always working properly. The abrupt stop and start is especially jarring when you are attempting deep sleep- similar to vertigo feeling as you are just falling asleep and you jump suddenly, but without the physical jump- lol.

I also wanted to sleep better.   I purchased Brain Wave,  Mind Tuner, Perfect Sleep, Tranquil Mind, Brain Beats, MyCalmBeat, Perfect Sleep, Deep Sleep, and My Meditation.  I tried them all and, to some extent, they all work.\nHowever, Brain Wave, Tranquil Mind and Perfect Sleep are, by far, the best for me.  Banzai Labs has done a good job.  You can select any of a variety of binaural applications from Morning Coffee straight through 20 routines to Deep Sleep.  I tried Power Nap for 20 minutes and dozed off.  However, instead of being a little groggy or spaced when I awoke, I was alert and oriented. \nYou can also select a background ambient noise and the sound level.  Unlike all of the other programs, you can select how long you want it to run.\nI now meditate every morning and Brain Wave and Mind Tuner have been reliable and helpful.\n\nPerfect Sleep has been very effective.  I have been getting up twice or three times a night and sometimes it difficult to fall back to sleep.  Now I listen to Deep Sleep for 15 minutes, take it off when it's done and immediately fall asleep and stay asleep for at least 3-4 hours.  If I awaken, I easily go back to sleep. \n\nAlthough I like Deep Sleep, the hypnosis simply is not as effective for me as the binaural beats of Perfect Sleep.","title":"It works really well but it's not your guru or ambien","userName":"lucky bsharit"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1281263062","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2015-11-03T07:37:49Z","rating":5,"review":"Big warning: This app won't cure your neuralgia, nor will make your psychosis or psychosomatic illnesses go away.

How unfair is that? \n\nThis app has some beats that do their intended work quite well. Like the sleep/wake up beats.  I'm trying the lucid dreaming from one of their sister apps and I can tell you so far I haven't been able to have any lucid dreaming HOWEVER, I start dreaming even BEFIRE completely falling asleep.\n\nFor example, just yesterday I was falling asleep when my roommate entered my room to look for some shoes and I remember quite clearly seeing her standing next to my bed asking me about the shoes and at the SAME time, I was seeing a dream overlapping my reality.  Like two things happening at the same time in the same space.\nI don't know if this was the result of listening to the beats but I'm really looking forward to something similar happening cause there is nothing cooler than to be talking half asleep to somebody and at the same time seeing how and old carriage goes across that person like a ghost.","title":"GREAT APP .

The frequency difference between these tones matches the brainwave frequency of the target state of mind. The listener will hear these carrier tones as an audible tone, however, when processing these two different tones the human brain will perceive the small frequency difference between the tones as an inaudible periodic beat. When exposed to this beat the listener's brainwaves will begin to synchronize with the beat frequency. What allows the human brain to perceive this beat is our directional hearing system, located in the brain stem.

The second is a Theta Meditation program that stays within the basic theta range to quickly bring the user to a meditative state.\n* We've also added new Gentle Alarms\n* We made the decision in this update to return Brain Wave to a Portrait-Only App.  We know some people will miss the Landscape UI, but we did this to focus on the Brainwave Entrainment and Audio experience, and to prepare for new devices and screen sizes.  Maintaining and testing portrait and landscape layouts for iOS 5-8, HD\u0026SD, and 3 Aspect Ratios had become the single most time consuming part of our development and testing, and soon there will be even more.  90% of our dev and testing time was spent tilting iPads and iPhones of different sizes and different iOS versions, tweaking code that had nothing to do with brainwave entrainment--the reason I and others use this app everyday.  Once the new Aspect Ratio devices come out and we have time to test with them, then maybe Landscape will make a comeback on the iPad.","releaseDate":"2014-09-06"},{"versionDisplay":"6.1","releaseNotes":"* Supports iOS 5.0 and higher * Thanks for making Brain Wave the Top Selling Brainwave Entrainment app 4 years!  This update includes improvements to our last major update, which included a ton of new features, including the ability to use your iTunes Music as the background and Alarm Audio, support for running another audio app simultaneously, such as a web or ebook reader, and UI updates for iOS 7.\n\n6.1 now allows you to save and load a different iTunes playlist for each brainwave entrainment program.\n\n6.0 Features\n- Updated UI for iOS 7\n\n- Added the ability to create a playlist of your own iTunes library music and use it as the background.  The behavior of the app when iTunes music is used instead of the included ambience is slightly different so please review the help.  Notably, unlike our included ambience which can be played at a volume below the device volume, iTunes music can only be played at the device volume.  So when playing iTunes music the Ambience volume slider disappears.\n\n- Added the ability to toggle whether the Stop and Pause buttons should fade down the audio or stop it immediately.\n\n- Enabled the use of your own iTunes Music for the Alarm Audio.\n\n- Added a new Save Preferences feature that allows you to Save, Load, or Restore to Default, the preferences for each program.  This saves duration, alarm, background preferences, and even a separate playlist for each program.\n\n- Added a toggle to the Custom Duration Menu that allows you to set the custom duration by duration or time.\n\n- Improved Fade-Down/Fade-Up between stages.\n\n- Users with Hypnosis, Meditation and Affirmation audio in their iTunes library have asked in the past that they be able to combine that audio with our Binaural Tones and Ambience, so we've enabled that as well.
