        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>App is easy to use, really wish there was continuous play between episodes. My kid loves the shows and keeps them occupied when I need to do things but having to stop after every episode to play the next show is kind of annoying. But overall great app &amp; streaming service for the babes.</p>

There is an option for continuous play, once on a series page any series page you will find 2 icons beneath the upper image, one will play all episodes in shuffle and the other will play one after the other in order as on that screen.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />BabyTV Support Team  </p>

Fix the dang iPad video subscription - why should we have to buy a separate subscription for iPhone vs iPad? And when we send an email to find out WHY we are paying for a subscription and the app still asks us to BUY a subscription and does NOT allow my child to see the content we are already paying for?? Do we need to go to social media and start complaining there? Just fix it.</p>
