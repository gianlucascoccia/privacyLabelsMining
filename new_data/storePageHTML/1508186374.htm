        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I definitely love love this app and it’s amazing how all these good movies are here and it’s all completely free but there is one thing and only one thing that keeps on bothering me. No it is not the ads, I understand that those are necessary to gain some money but whenever an ad does come up once it is done the movie/show you are watching skips forward a bit and if you try to rewind it to see the part you missed, the app makes you watch the same ads again for a second time. This is quite annoying because there are some parts of the movie that get skipped but some times that part is important but you are not able to see it. I am not asking for you to take away the ads or change the thing that makes you watch ads for a second time, but all I am asking for is that you fix it so that after you watching an ad it goes back a couple seconds so that you don’t miss/forget anything or at least make it so that it takes you back to the second it stopped. Overall this app is amazing and I am loving it. 10 out of 10.</p>

    Terrible tvOS app

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>If I could avoid using peacock, I would, but there are too many good shows. However, it is still a painfully bad experience. On iOS/iPadOS there is no Picture in Picture support, which is very annoying, and sometimes the audio breaks and I have to exit the thing I’m watching and reopen it. That is annoying, but not too bad. tvOS is the real problem. It works terribly with the new Siri remote. Normally you can go back or forward ten seconds, but with the new Siri remote there is no way to do that. Clicking the forward and back buttons will bring up an orange symbol to go back or forward 10 seconds, but it won’t do anything, and it won’t go away until you tap somewhere else on the remote. If I had this problem in any other app, it would be slightly annoying, but I would just use the normal method of swiping (or rotating with the new circle gesture on the new Siri remote) to get where I need to go. Not only does peacock not support the new circle gesture, the swiping is terrible. This is probably the biggest problem with peacock. Tiny finger movements that would get me forward or back 4 seconds or so in the Apple TV app do nothing. But as soon as I start swiping my finger enough for peacock to react, it moves too fast for me to get even close to what I want. I can end up full minutes away from my target. This has been a problem with the old and new Siri remote, and it needs to be fixed.</p>

    Constant changes in quality and content

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I am a day 1 user, waited months for this app at first never had any issues in my Apple TV or iPhone but now it’s constant errors. Most recent is just solid black screen with an outline of the channel schedule instead of puss in boots error screen occasionally. They also took away the office channel quietly a couple of days ago. Changed the reality tv “in it to win it” channel (that had huge variety in programming) into deal or no deal for over a week non stop 24/7. Just rename the channel already after nearly 250 episodes straight it’s officially the deal or no deal channel! I assumed okay maybe after they play each episode in the series I will get to see something new, sadly they just stared over from episode 1 again. Same episodes of kitchen nightmares (season 1) have been playing non stop for 5 days when it’s KN evening time block and the profit season 1. This didn’t used to be the case! There would be a mix of several seasons. I was thinking about subscribing but these are pretty major and sudden changes that make no sense. They were also what I used the app for 99% of the time. Went from being my #1 app to deleting and resubscribing to CBS all access who instead of taking away content added over 200 season of different shows last week.</p>

No it is not the ads, I understand that those are necessary to gain some money but whenever an ad does come up once it is done the movie/show you are watching skips forward a bit and if you try to rewind it to see the part you missed, the app makes you watch the same ads again for a second time. This is quite annoying because there are some parts of the movie that get skipped but some times that part is important but you are not able to see it. I am not asking for you to take away the ads or change the thing that makes you watch ads for a second time, but all I am asking for is that you fix it so that after you watching an ad it goes back a couple seconds so that you don’t miss/forget anything or at least make it so that it takes you back to the second it stopped.

However, it is still a painfully bad experience. On iOS/iPadOS there is no Picture in Picture support, which is very annoying, and sometimes the audio breaks and I have to exit the thing I’m watching and reopen it. That is annoying, but not too bad. tvOS is the real problem. It works terribly with the new Siri remote. Normally you can go back or forward ten seconds, but with the new Siri remote there is no way to do that. Clicking the forward and back buttons will bring up an orange symbol to go back or forward 10 seconds, but it won’t do anything, and it won’t go away until you tap somewhere else on the remote. If I had this problem in any other app, it would be slightly annoying, but I would just use the normal method of swiping (or rotating with the new circle gesture on the new Siri remote) to get where I need to go. Not only does peacock not support the new circle gesture, the swiping is terrible. This is probably the biggest problem with peacock. Tiny finger movements that would get me forward or back 4 seconds or so in the Apple TV app do nothing. But as soon as I start swiping my finger enough for peacock to react, it moves too fast for me to get even close to what I want. I can end up full minutes away from my target. This has been a problem with the old and new Siri remote, and it needs to be fixed.","title":"Terrible tvOS app","userName":"HMK48718"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6330214664","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-08-17T14:55:29Z","rating":3,"review":"I am a day 1 user, waited months for this app at first never had any issues in my Apple TV or iPhone but now it’s constant errors.

Changed the reality tv “in it to win it” channel (that had huge variety in programming) into deal or no deal for over a week non stop 24/7. Just rename the channel already after nearly 250 episodes straight it’s officially the deal or no deal channel! I assumed okay maybe after they play each episode in the series I will get to see something new, sadly they just stared over from episode 1 again.

This is horrible. If you’re going to buy out the main streaming service to something that has a full blown culture behind the profession, then do your best to support it or otherwise give it to someone who has the gaul or even the slightest intention to do so. I’ll tell you one thing, my family can’t watch a cell phone together and it’s unreasonable to expect something so asinine. For such a selection of material to watch, I honestly can’t believe in 2021 this is an issue. Peacock “TV” - false. This is frankly pathetic and I won’t be renewing my subscription, hopefully someone who cares will do some justice to this completely ridiculous fumbling and vague handling of the term “TV” - television, as in NOT A PHONE.

For example: 1. there is no picture-in-picture support. 2. if my headphones come out accidentally, the content keeps going though the speakers rather than pausing. This is unlike nearly every other streaming app and is troublesome. If I wanted the streaming content broadcast loudly though my phone's speakers I would not have been using headphones. 3. If you tap the three dots in the corner when watching a TV series, it shows all the series' episodes. The problem is that the episodes are not categorised by season. Instead, all the episodes from the beginning of the series are shown. This is troublesome when there are hundreds of episodes. It would be much better if the episodes were categorised by season.

But there are just way too many steaming services now and paying for all of them to watch one or two shows is just ridiculous. So I’m not paying for this one. The free content on Peacock is abundant, but it’s mostly shows that no one wants to watch or that you can watch for free on the Hallmark Channel or wherever they now show Murder She Wrote. Not exactly cutting edge programming. If this was an excellent app, I might have been interested. But it is clunky to operate, not very intuitive, and slow. So. Slow. It can take 5+ minutes to search for, find, and start playing a show. All while I’m watching those little rainbow dots go in circles. And the app freezes and crashes a lot. Not usually during a show, but definitely a lot while navigating the app and searching. We have super fast internet (more than a gig in speed to our house) and have no problem getting Netflix or Prime to load fast. Even CBS All Access is faster. Personally, I hope we will soon see consolidation in this space so we can see our favorite shows without having to subscribe to a dozen different services. And as those apps compete against each other, Peacock will not be a winner. NBC, you gave it a try. Now I hope you will license your best shows to Netflix and let us watch while you earn royalties for doing nothing.","title":"Clunky, slow app. Not gonna pay just for the Office.","userName":"CTCVA"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6918520572","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-01-27T07:31:20Z","rating":3,"review":"Add Picture in Picture, audio descriptions \u0026 autoplay cancel. \nI really want to love this app. I even paid for the commercial free version, because I love NBC so much. The content is great. Unfortunately, this app is lacking in several accessibility features. Additionally, it needs different user profiles, so that I can have a watchlist that I don’t share with the rest of my family. It will not allow me to do picture in picture, which means my shows are interrupted each time I open a message to reply. I am very disappointed that there are not audio descriptions available for most shows. People with low vision or blindness, this limits access to some great television. Finally, I have tried to work out how to cancel autoplay as a default, but I can’t seem to do it. If I do not physically tap the screen before an episode ends, the app will automatically play the next episode. This is especially frustrating if I fall asleep watching a show, only to wake up with a whole season over. \n\nAgain, I really do want to love this app. Every other streaming service I have allows for picture in picture, as well as autoplay camel, and most have audio descriptions.

I would like to suggest maybe adding a feedback option in the app where users can provide feedback on the app, and possibly have a list of things to add for the feedback, like how Netflix does. Have an option to request NBC shows to be added onto peacock that is currently not on peacock, and if for some reason the shows cannot be added maybe provide a reason why it cannot be added. Also I would like to suggest having a profile of some sort for franchises to be added into one group for example the Chicago Franchise (Med, PD, Fire) Law and Order ( LO, SVU, CI, OC,) where users can click on the the group of shows and then it would open into selecting which one you want to watch. I would also like to request all the Law and Order Shows and movie to be added into peacock that are not on there right now, also the Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice.

But then the app loads, only to take a long time to switch to another screen, like when browse is selected or opening settings.  One would expect a better user interface and faster app coming out of an entertainment/tech company. Feels like the app isn’t a priority.  Would be nice if it allowed for multiple “users” like spouse and kids as we like different shows.   Lastly, they should re-think commercials. I’m not against commercials and like them if it means affordable subscriptions. But the commercials are too long. It’s not the good old days of network tv.  They should redesign how commercials work for the modern age. Right now I just look at my phone during commercials. So, my conclusion is that it’s an app to go to when there is a show you want to watch, ie: Yellowstone, but not an app you GO TO to find something to watch.  Good luck.

They decided to split up Premier League coverage between Peacock and NBCSN. So now you need two different subscriptions to watch games. To make it worse, you can’t stream from your iPad or iPhone to your television. It’s just completely baffling to me why they’re making it harder to watch these games. I remember being so pleased with NBCSN’s coverage of the premier league when they first started a few years ago. Now, I can’t wait for another network to pick up the deal. The constant division of all these apps you need just to watch your games/shows is exhausting for the consumer. I’m sure in a few years NBC will come out with yet another app requiring another monthly subscription. “Download Peacock 1 to watch the first half of this soccer game, and make sure to download Peacock 2 to watch the second half!!! Each one is only $7.99/month!!! Post match coverage will be on NBCSN Gold, so make sure you’re subscribed to that as well, which is on top of your subscription to NBC Sports!” Meanwhile NBC is wondering why people pirate everything online. I know I’m just a lowly consumer, but I think if you make it easier to watch what we want, that’s how you gain customer loyalty. NBC is doing the opposite of this. Thanks NBC.
