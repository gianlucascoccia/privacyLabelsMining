    Great podcatcher app, one big flaw
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love Pocket Casts. Sick of how buggy and confusing the proprietary Apple podcast app is, I switched to Pocket Casts over a year ago and haven’t looked back. The UI is much cleaner and easier to navigate. My one complaint is that the search feature is very basic and only searches for whole podcasts rather than podcast episodes. (So for example, let’s say I want to listen to a podcast episode about the infamous Dyatlov Pass incident; searching “Dyatlov Pass” wouldn’t yield episodes about Dyatlov Pass from various podcasts, it would only yield podcasts whose name happens to be similar to or contain the words “Dyatlov Pass”.) That’s a real shame because the one good thing about the proprietary Apple podcast app was that I liked using the search feature to search for some niche subject I was interested in, and I would discover new podcasts by listening to their episode about the thing I wanted to hear about. On Pocket Casts, I just have to just kind of browse their discover page and hope that I find some podcast that happens to have some episodes that interest me.</p>

    What I’ve been looking for... FINALLY!
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I honestly don’t understand some of the negative reviews. Some are overly harsh for such minor inconveniences. I don’t know if the gripes are legitimate or just people expecting absolute 100% perfection from an app, and a developer with a stellar, bug-free track record. <br /><br />I had been using the Apple Podcast app for years but finally ditched it because of syncing issues between multiple devices (no matter how I tweaked the settings). I then tried at least ten others before landing on Pocket Casts. The other podcast apps were usable and each had its pros and cons, but Pocket Casts is the only app yet that syncs the way I need it to. I can listen on my iPhone, then log into my Mac (web interface) and pick right up where I left off. I haven’t tried the Mac app yet. I’m perfectly content with the other web page for listening. I also like the listening stats on the app and how it shows how much time I’ve saved with skipping, speed, trimming and so on.<br /><br />The layout is great and looks sleek and natural on the iPhone. As one user mentioned in a review, having folders of some sort would be nice. This way all of my podcasts aren’t lumped together, but can be separated by Sports, Science, etc... Other than this, I’m really liking what I’m seeing so far. I subscribed for the year because I really don’t see anything else out there being better. I’ve looked again and again and haven’t found it until now. Thanks!</p>

    Best podcast app with a few quirks
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I want to just echo what most other reviewers are saying, in that Pocket Casts is the best podcast player out there.  The UI in my opinion should used as an example in exemplary design in UI/UX programs or schools.<br />I’ve tried others like Overcast or Google Podcasts, but I keep coming back to Pocket Casts. They’ve really put a ton of effort in refining their app over the years, often including entirely new features for free.  They’re also one of the few companies that includes a quality web player so you keep up with your podcasts while your on your computer. <br />As someone who relies on this app daily, it’s only natural that some issues might arise from time to time. One feature I use heavily is the ability to Cast podcast episodes to our Google Home or Nest speakers.  Most of the time it works fine, but lately it seems like there’s some communication or latency issues between the server and the app.  There is a long standing issue where if you finish a podcast episode while Chromecasting and your phone’s screen locked, then when you unlock your phone and go back to the app, the episode you just finished will still show it’s progress as being where it was prior to the screen being locked. <br />Overall, this app is a must have. None of the other podcast apps, including the overly praised Overcast, come close to matching the ease of use and simple pleasure of using Pocket Casts!</p>

If that sounds like you, check out the settings for that podcast.\n- Added a way to delete your account (be careful, there is no undo on this, but there are plenty of warnings along the way).\n- Voice over enhancement for episode rows: the app will now tell you which podcast they are associated with.\n- Added season and episode meta data to lock screen/bluetooth devices so you can more easily identify the episode you're listening to.\n","releaseDate":"2021-04-21"},{"versionDisplay":"7.17.2","releaseNotes":"I feel like our release number has been at home on lockdown and hasn't had a haircut in a while. 7.17.2 is quite the mouthful! Anyway, what's new you ask? I assume you're asking, I can't actually hear you FYI but why else would you be here?!\n\nChanges\"\n- Improved the speed selection button in CarPlay\n- Fixed an issue where the tab bar could shuffle over and tapping the blank space would crash the app\n- Learnt that it's spelt \"trigerred\" not \"triggered\". I put those two backwards just to trigger you. You're welcome.\n- Added a setting to open show notes links in your browser instead of in app\n- Fixed some issues with the watchOS app","releaseDate":"2021-03-23"},{"versionDisplay":"7.17.1","releaseNotes":"I kinda like these smaller \"fix some things\" type releases. In theory you get to fix a few things without introducing new issues. Always fun! Plus you get to write release notes, have I ever said how much I enjoy...ok...maybe that's a stretch but I do enjoy our one way interactions!\n- Added delete to the multi-select option for the Files section\n\n- Hopefully fixed an issue that could cause Pocket Casts Siri Suggestions not to have artwork\n\n- Fixed issues with our support email link not working for people who don't have the default Mail app configured\n\n- Various other small tweaks including issues with the timeline scrubber on iPad","releaseDate":"2021-02-18"},{"versionDisplay":"7.17","releaseNotes":"Welcome to 2021. The less we say about 2020 the better, so let's just talk ch-ch-chaaaanges shall we?\n- Two new high contrast themes for you to enjoy. Yes, we have gone a bit theme crazy of late, but these are handy for those of you that are a bit older like me and need more contrast in your life.\n- Turn and face the strange.\n- Some small bug fixes including one where the app was convinced the Red Velvet icon was paid. It's been a long year, easy mistake for it to make.\n- Our apologies for the complex joke in the previous update, it melted one too many brains. Here's a pretend dog photo to distract you: [cute_dog.jpg]. The imagination is a powerful thing friends, use it. And once you have, please send us a picture of the dog you imagined!

It's exactly as awesome as it sounds.\n- We made some earmazing enhancements to our Volume Boost algorithm. It's now eartasticly eargasmic.\n- Improved support for password filling and opening Pocket Casts share links.\n- Fixed quite a few bugs, including some weird ones where your tab bar could disappear, never to be seen again.\n","releaseDate":"2020-12-13"},{"versionDisplay":"7.15","releaseNotes":"Some people doubted we could get past version 7.9 without making the next one 8.0. I'm here to tell you, they were all wrong. We're at 7.15 and going strong. Maths is meaningless, numbers are virtual, the universe is finitely infinite.\n\nStuff that changed y'all (we heard y'all love that word, and you know what, it's kinda wholesome. I'm now on board with y'all, y'all):\n- There are many reasons why your listening might be interrupted for long time. An unannounced visit from an old friend. A 10-day silent meditation retreat. An unexpected holiday in maison gaol. So we now rewind a little bit when you unpause after a break, to help you remember where you were up to. You can turn this off in Settings \u003e General \u003e Intelligent Playback Resumption.\n- Speaking of long breaks, it’s probably been a while since you made a new filter. Well, we changed the steps. Now, when you create a filter, the first thing you do is actually create the filter. Once you’ve done that, give it a name, colour, and icon, and you’re on your way!\n- iOS 14 widget improvements based on your feedback. The small widget now matches the app icon and also won't take you to Discover as much.\n- Fixed an issue that could prevent custom playback effects from being saved correctly.\n- CarPlay icons tweak. These should now look correct on both light and dark CarPlay.\n- Fixed an issue with labels being cut off in Discover when the bold accessibility setting was used.\n- One person wrote us a really cool email about being able to tap to dismiss iPad episode cards. You can now tap the background to dismiss them.\n- Fixed an issue where the heading of a podcast page could be transparent and your words would scroll under it War Stars style.\n- Improved private feed support.\n- Fixed some Siri Shortcuts related issues\n","releaseDate":"2020-11-19"},{"versionDisplay":"7.14","releaseNotes":"One thing, to me, has stood out clearer than anything else in the decade or so we've been building this app. Y'all have opinions and preferences and love tweaking things. I've also realised I hate the word \"y'all\" but that literally only just happened, so let's put a pin in that and circle back, shall we? Version 7.14 brings you that sweet, sweet configuration and control you crave!\n\n- You can now choose how aggressive you want your silence trimming to be:\n  - Mild? That's how I like it.\n  - Medium? I guess I'll allow it, or...\n  - Mad Max? Yeah I get it, witness you all shiny and chrome blazing a trail through your podcasts in record time. On average that setting can easily shave 10% off how long it takes to listen to a podcast...but beware. No power like this can be free.\n\n- Fixed an issue that prevented some Siri Shortcuts from running properly","releaseDate":"2020-10-22"},{"versionDisplay":"7.13","releaseNotes":"Version 7.13, unlucky for some but perfect for Spooktober! Not that we really understand your obsession with that here down under, but more power to you our northern cousins! This release brings:\n\n- Brand new shiny iOS 14 widgets! Yes you've been asking for them and now they are here. Use the small one instead of the app icon. Put the medium one on that fancy new widget home page you're making or just SLAP THAT GIANT ONE on your main home screen like a Pocket Casts tattoo. Loud and proud!\n- Improved iOS 14 CarPlay including some great Now Playing changes like chapter support, a mark as played button and being able to open the podcast straight from the player.\n- Fixed some performance issues when opening the Up Next list with more than 200 episodes in it. We still don't know how you're going to get through 200+ episodes, but whatever floats Jeremy's boat.\n- Speaking of Jeremy: Added the ability to tap on the podcast/chapter artwork to zoom in on it. Just in time to have missed the 2020 Jeremy's.\n- Various other fixes and improvements including pulling down episode cards being a bit wonky in the last update.","releaseDate":"2020-10-18"},{"versionDisplay":"7.12","releaseNotes":"Version 7.12 expands on the multi-select support you all seem to love, with even more enhancements:\n- We heard from a lot of you that you wanted to be able to do the reverse of some of the new actions we gave you. So now you can perform actions like un-star, un-archive, mark as unplayed and removing downloads. That's right, it's opposite day!\n- Multi-select now works for episodes in your custom files section\n- You can now re-arrange multi-select actions for Up Next\n- Fixed some issues with multi-select ordering when adding to things like Up Next\n- Improved iOS 14 support. For all those asking, yes a widget is coming soon! We're almost done putting the final few touches on it.\n- Duration filtering in an Episode filter can now be set as low as 1 minute\n- Fixed the Up Next drag handle not being visible on iOS 12 and below\n- Fixed an issue where \"Remote Skips Chapters\" wouldn't work in some cases like CarPlay and the lock screen when turned on\n- Fixed some issues with text getting cut off on the Apple Watch\n- Fixed an issue with some podcasts not having their MP3 chapters recognised properly\n- Improved the CarPlay interface for you fancy iOS 14 people.\n- Lots of other small fixes that are too overnumerous to mention.

But you know what, for once we're going to go with something a little different and let you make the jokes. Tweet us your best ones!\n\nOh you probably also want to know what's new? Well, you see, Goldilocks was complaining to us about her commute, that her New Releases filter was filled with episodes that were always either too long, or too short! We couldn’t bear to listen to this story any longer, so we added the ability to filter by duration. In any Episode Filter, tap the “Duration” chip to start limiting by length.\n\nAnd while you’re there, add even more precision by sorting your filter so that the shortest (or longest), or newest (or oldest) episodes appear at the top (or bottom). It’s up (or down) to you!\n\nI know what you're thinking, it's this kind of innovative, transformative, downright punny thinking that is going to win us some awards.

You bet your sweet little bippy it does. I know you're all desperately waiting for our 7.11 release so you can make convenience store jokes, but in the meantime:\n- We've added multi-select to episode lists throughout the app. You can now long press on any episode to perform bulk actions like archiving or downloading and more! You can also use built in drag with two fingers gesture to start a multi-select operation if you're feeling extra-dextrous.\n- The above actions are re-orderable so you can keep your favourite 2 up front and handy at all times\n- You can also long press while in multi-select mode to be given the option of selecting all the episodes above or below the current one\n- Try it out and let us know what you think!\n- Why is each of the above it's own bullet point? I don't know, force of habit!\n- We've slightly tweaked the design of the podcast page to make common functions easier. You can now show and hide archived episodes with a single tap and this setting is now per podcast. We know a lot of you have asked for that, and it's here!\n- There's also a new setting under General where you can choose whether you'd like to see archived episodes by default, changing this will also give you the option of changing it for all your current podcasts\n- As always we've fixed and improved various other small things throughout the app\n- Bullet points are your friends, people!","releaseDate":"2020-07-30"},{"versionDisplay":"7.9.1","releaseNotes":"Thanks for all your feedback on the 7.9 release, today we have some smol changes to share:\n- Fixed a number of issues where when playing podcasts on your phone, the watch app might not load to the now playing page\n- Fixed an issue where the watch app might show the wrong dates in an episode list\n- Fixed an issue with the Radioactive theme interfering with iPad trackpad scrolling\n- Download page now shows download icons to match the rest of the watch app\n- Fixed an issue with the play/pause buttons being different sizes in the watch app\n- Various other small fixes and tweaks that are really hard to type into this little box while still making any sense","releaseDate":"2020-06-29"},{"versionDisplay":"7.9","releaseNotes":"Well well well, what have we here...a major feature update.\n\nHighlights:\n- We’ve added four new app icons, so you can get closer to that perfect match of icons and background on your home screen. Or maybe you just want one for every day of the week.\n- For Pocket Casts Plus subscribers, our watch app is now strong enough to stand on its own. That's right, download for offline playback, or just straight up stream episodes from your cellular/WiFi connected watch. I'm sure you'll all aspire to use this while \"jogging\", which if you're like me really means \"walking, not even that briskly, honestly\".\n- New theme: Radioactivity. Have you been pleading for a pipboy? Do you go ga-ga for a geiger counter? Craving a cathode ray? This theme's for you. Yes, we did go a bit OTT, but it's worth it. Pocket Casts Plus only because those are the most OTT people we know. Respect.\n- Added clear button to search on podcast grid/list and discover pages\n- Much improved Trim Silence algorithm.

It's all fun and games when you're at 7.1 and 7.2, but as you get to 7.8 you just know you're going to have to either do the weird 7.10 thing, or break your convention and go for 7.9.9.9.9.9.1 to avoid going to 8. This release gets us one closer to that, and also fixes a whole bunch of weird and wonderful bugs. Release numbers are just plain weird, let's be honest.\n\nOh and a shout out to our BMW owning friends. I'm going to be kind to you all and make 0 jokes about your car choice, except maybe by taking a slight dig at you with our new setting:\nGeneral -\u003e Legacy Bluetooth Support is something you'll want to turn on if you're having issues with the app pausing in your car. It's ok, \"legacy\" sounds like \"classy\" so same, same right?","releaseDate":"2020-02-06"},{"versionDisplay":"7.7","releaseNotes":"This release introduces some new discover section features, such as podcast collections. This is a little bit of a tease because you won't immediately get new ones but when you do we think you'll like them.\n\nWe also fixed some bugs you nice people reported to us and improved a few things here and there.","releaseDate":"2020-01-23"},{"versionDisplay":"7.6.1","releaseNotes":"Every great movie, needs a sequel. How else are you going to cash in on the amazing characters and storylines you've developed without bothering to make a brand new world from scratch? Welcome to our 7.6 sequel. We've named it 7.6.1 which we think you'll get a kick out of!\n\n- Accessibility fixes for various controls in the player\n- Fixed possible crash when long pressing in the Profile -\u003e Downloads Section\n- Fixed incorrect podcasts being queued sometimes in Profile -\u003e Downloads long press, Play all from here.\n- Fixed an issue that could cause your notification settings to not be saved to the server\n- Fixed a few bits of UI rotating when they weren't meant to. Cheeky little buggers!\n- Fixed a typo in the player tour. Fixed a typo in the player tour. Fixed a typo in the player tour. Get it?! These are not 3 separate fixes ;)\n- Fixed some other crashes and minor UI issues\n\nHappy new year by the way! I was going to make a whole bunch of jokes around vision and 20 20, maybe even some see you next decade material, but I've spared you all of that. You're welcome!","releaseDate":"2020-01-01"},{"versionDisplay":"7.6","releaseNotes":"We were tempted to call this version \"Stuff what youse allses did ask for\" but apparently that's not as good as \"7.6\". So this is version 7.6. With stuff what youses allses did ask for. I don't make the rules I just write the notes.\n\nFeatures include:\n- A brand new free theme, Indigo. To help you understand it, let's describe it like one would a fine wine: Rich blue elements are paired with off-white backgrounds, reducing eye fatigue and enhancing tactility.\n- Up Next is now more accessible, on its own page you can now access from the button on the mini player, the button on the player or by swiping up. There's new multi-select actions as well to help you manage it harder than you've ever managed it before.\n- The Now Playing screen has had a facelift based on all your feedback. You can now swipe right over to notes and there's a configurable toolbar so you can put your favourite actions right on the player page!\n- We've also done lots of small things, like adding sort by episode length to the podcast page.\n\nThere's the usual raft of bug fixes and performance improvements too, but we hope by now you're used to those being part of every release. Ok everyone, don't forget to like and subscribe, and I'll see you all...oh...this isn't my [name of streaming service redacted] channel? Maybe just leave us a nice review in the store if you feel so inclined? They make us all warm and fuzzy, and we all need warmth and fuzz from time to time, no?","releaseDate":"2019-12-20"},{"versionDisplay":"7.5.4","releaseNotes":"Fixes an issue where CarPlay would say that it can't connect to Pocket Casts. Thanks to everyone who helped us track this one down. I appreciate you all so much that I'd like to write you a poem. Alas, I suck at poetry and I'm also in a hurry, so please accept this joke in its stead:\n\nTwo girls walk into a bar. You'd think at least one of them would have seen it.\n\n....BADUM TSSSSS...\n\nAlso cheers to everyone who said they still read our release notes! It makes me so happy to know that I now have hundreds of extra people I can be nervous about letting down! Don't worry, the queue is long but the refreshments are amazing.","releaseDate":"2019-11-10"}],"hasPrivacyPolicyText":false,"supportedLocales":[{"name":"English","tag":"en-US"}],"customAttributes":{"default":{"default":{"customScreenshotsByType":{"ipadPro":[{"width":2048,"height":2732,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/8d/9d/02/8d9d020c-3553-75b5-e9f8-4dde29c11c5f/mzl.pehohijz.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"680203","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"863535"},{"width":2732,"height":2048,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/cc/33/76/cc3376e8-6c46-8bf0-c30d-77cf9f97d085/mzl.dgvgjoog.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f9f9f9","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"013609","textColor3":"313131","textColor4":"335d39"},{"width":2732,"height":2048,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/a6/86/97/a686971f-80d2-992b-0f6c-5af7cd101f67/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"0c0916","textColor1":"f4faf4","textColor2":"d1d1d1","textColor3":"c6cac8","textColor4":"a9a9ab"},{"width":2048,"height":2732,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/77/33/83/773383ed-f655-010f-74f5-a1986539ebdd/eb484f42-51d5-4fd9-8725-bdb4a3a9ca11_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029_-_2020-07-27_at_13.36.19.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"131c43","textColor1":"feffff","textColor2":"33ebec","textColor3":"ced1d9","textColor4":"2dc2ca"}],"ipadPro_2018":[{"width":2048,"height":2732,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/11/e2/05/11e205e3-c71e-7dd5-1ba6-c07cd3c4708f/mzl.rhtltejs.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"670c00","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"853d33"},{"width":2732,"height":2048,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/f0/df/6e/f0df6ee1-fa78-07e2-e628-bc981a011f49/mzl.adahuvoo.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"fdfdfd","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"013509","textColor3":"323232","textColor4":"335d39"},{"width":2732,"height":2048,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/47/c0/49/47c049fb-f84c-719b-286b-43c82b4b6290/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"0c0916","textColor1":"faf9fa","textColor2":"cecfcf","textColor3":"cac9cc","textColor4":"a7a7aa"},{"width":2048,"height":2732,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/da/33/58/da3358ee-7a0a-56e8-0dc0-a3129674c301/78d76d49-5898-4eea-87fa-abe8049830e4_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00284th_generation_U0029_-_2020-07-27_at_13.33.29.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"020226","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"39e9ec","textColor3":"ccccd3","textColor4":"2ebac4"}],"appleWatch_2018":[{"width":368,"height":448,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/03/5d/4c/035d4ccb-a182-a7de-8562-bc01ba645c9c/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f03d37","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"c0312c"},{"width":368,"height":448,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/69/f3/79/69f37909-755b-461d-c46a-e27271ff7b75/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f03d37","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"c0312c"},{"width":368,"height":448,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/83/f9/e1/83f9e186-6844-924e-8d7f-0f6176bf286a/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f03d37","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"c0312c"},{"width":368,"height":448,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/66/2b/8d/662b8d36-918f-2d09-464f-947e3e771eed/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f03d37","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"c0312c"},{"width":368,"height":448,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/bc/d4/0d/bcd40d51-8c45-8d94-ef7a-24e1a2a88f47/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f03d37","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"c0312c"},{"width":368,"height":448,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/66/0b/4d/660b4dbc-a00f-80ba-c5a0-02e1d4b0fef7/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"dcdcdc","textColor2":"f03d37","textColor3":"b0b0b0","textColor4":"c0312c"},{"width":368,"height":448,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/d4/d8/54/d4d8543c-9984-c763-278b-5c1c0da32457/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"dcdcdc","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"b0b0b0"},{"width":368,"height":448,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/95/0e/e7/950ee73d-4709-e72d-575d-368a62a99d09/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f53e38","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"c4322d"},{"width":368,"height":448,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/c7/f0/89/c7f089ee-1de5-e767-c3

Sick of how buggy and confusing the proprietary Apple podcast app is, I switched to Pocket Casts over a year ago and haven’t looked back. The UI is much cleaner and easier to navigate. My one complaint is that the search feature is very basic and only searches for whole podcasts rather than podcast episodes. (So for example, let’s say I want to listen to a podcast episode about the infamous Dyatlov Pass incident; searching “Dyatlov Pass” wouldn’t yield episodes about Dyatlov Pass from various podcasts, it would only yield podcasts whose name happens to be similar to or contain the words “Dyatlov Pass”.) That’s a real shame because the one good thing about the proprietary Apple podcast app was that I liked using the search feature to search for some niche subject I was interested in, and I would discover new podcasts by listening to their episode about the thing I wanted to hear about. On Pocket Casts, I just have to just kind of browse their discover page and hope that I find some podcast that happens to have some episodes that interest me.","title":"Great podcatcher app, one big flaw","userName":"Monica00000"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6711489957","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-12-03T03:12:09Z","rating":5,"review":"I honestly don’t understand some of the negative reviews. Some are overly harsh for such minor inconveniences. I don’t know if the gripes are legitimate or just people expecting absolute 100% perfection from an app, and a developer with a stellar, bug-free track record. \n\nI had been using the Apple Podcast app for years but finally ditched it because of syncing issues between multiple devices (no matter how I tweaked the settings). I then tried at least ten others before landing on Pocket Casts. The other podcast apps were usable and each had its pros and cons, but Pocket Casts is the only app yet that syncs the way I need it to. I can listen on my iPhone, then log into my Mac (web interface) and pick right up where I left off. I haven’t tried the Mac app yet. I’m perfectly content with the other web page for listening. I also like the listening stats on the app and how it shows how much time I’ve saved with skipping, speed, trimming and so on.\n\nThe layout is great and looks sleek and natural on the iPhone. As one user mentioned in a review, having folders of some sort would be nice. This way all of my podcasts aren’t lumped together, but can be separated by Sports, Science, etc... Other than this, I’m really liking what I’m seeing so far. I subscribed for the year because I really don’t see anything else out there being better.

The UI in my opinion should used as an example in exemplary design in UI/UX programs or schools.\nI’ve tried others like Overcast or Google Podcasts, but I keep coming back to Pocket Casts. They’ve really put a ton of effort in refining their app over the years, often including entirely new features for free.  They’re also one of the few companies that includes a quality web player so you keep up with your podcasts while your on your computer. \nAs someone who relies on this app daily, it’s only natural that some issues might arise from time to time. One feature I use heavily is the ability to Cast podcast episodes to our Google Home or Nest speakers.  Most of the time it works fine, but lately it seems like there’s some communication or latency issues between the server and the app.  There is a long standing issue where if you finish a podcast episode while Chromecasting and your phone’s screen locked, then when you unlock your phone and go back to the app, the episode you just finished will still show it’s progress as being where it was prior to the screen being locked. \nOverall, this app is a must have. None of the other podcast apps, including the overly praised Overcast, come close to matching the ease of use and simple pleasure of using Pocket Casts!","title":"Best podcast app with a few quirks","userName":"jjstratton"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7313074163","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-05-08T14:54:07Z","rating":5,"review":"I’ve been using Apple Podcasts for the past ten years and have seen its interface go from easy and straightforward to complicated and lacking of up front info. I started looking for another app and found Pocket Casts. Downloaded it and got it set up with the basics and it was like a breath of fresh air. All of my podcasts are right up front and easy to access. I especially like the info screens (Notes) for episodes that are easy to see and give the info I’m looking for. The ability to touch an episode and not have it start playing is another bonus as Apple always irritated me when I’m just trying to find out info about a cast and have to click on a tiny link under the title to go to the cast for info. The big and straightforward download and play arrows tell just what I need to know about the podcast I’m looking at. Once I learned how to use and set up the filters I was absolutely hooked. The included New Releases filter is great and I added one that shows me what I have downloaded so that I can basically use it as a playlist. BTW I haven’t had any issues with downloading and episodes of one cast I subscribe to that were never available on Apple are readily available through Pocket Casts. I could go on and on but, all in all, I’m loving Pocket Casts right now and have completely switched over to it from Apple Podcasts without any regrets.","title":"Great replacement for Apple Podcasts","userName":"DeejHames"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7504916620","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-06-25T16:18:17Z","rating":3,"review":"This is my favorite podcast app by far. The ability to add filters and the huge amount of control I have over what I play next is fantastic. And pocket casts actually shows the older episodes on my “up next” list on Apple CarPlay, something that Apple Podcasts refuses to do (for no good reason I can think of). \nHowever, I’ve been running into an error that makes it difficult to continue to use this app. Sometimes, when I’m listening to an episode, the player will jump back to a portion of the podcast I’ve already listened to. The problem is that when this happens, the timer/progress bar (scrubber? Idk tech names for UI elements) doesn’t update, and the podcast will stop playing when it reaches the end of the timer, rather than the end of the recording, which means I can’t listen to the end of the episode!!! The only way to fix it is to force close the app and then start playing the episode again, but it always starts playing at some random point so I have to spend time looking for where I got cut off. I mostly listen to podcasts while I work, which means my hands are busy, so I either have to stop what I’m doing to fix the app, or miss the end of my episode (and I listen to a lot of true crime—the end is the best part). This would easily be a 5 star app if I didn’t have to deal with this pretty significant inconvenience all the time.","title":"Favorite podcast app but…","userName":"StarlaThornhill"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5268481738","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-12-13T18:12:16Z","rating":5,"review":"I have been an Audible junkie for the past 5 years and just started listening to Podcasts about 6 months ago.

The interface is smooth, they have very playback effect available (speed control, trim the silence and volume boost), an easy to access notes section that gives you the option to jump to a certain section of the podcast if available, and a nice way to organize the podcasts you subscribe to (although Castbox give the greatest control). In addition, you can stream via Chromecast (not all apps provide this) and a really nice iPad app that syncs nicely with you iPhone app. This is really a great app!\n\nLook past the overall score of this app on the Apple store and give this app a look.

Since then, it’s been my go to for podcasts because it has a great interface and is easy to use. However, I don’t know why but I’ve been having so many problems with it lately. The main one is that podcasts won’t load. I don’t always have space on my phone to download my podcasts since I take a lot of photos and video on a day to day basis, meaning I stream a lot of my content. For some reason, I always have problems with podcasts from this app recently. It’ll load a couple of seconds, then it will refuse to play anything for a while, then all of a sudden it’ll start working again. It’s not like I’m losing internet connection, as it will even happen on WiFi. Sometimes it’ll even do it with downloaded podcasts. Then I have even more problems with CarPlay. If I plug my phone in to use pocket casts, sometimes it’ll just completely freeze everything on my phone until I unplug and restart my phone. It’s only with this app. \nThat all being said, I still enjoyed my time with this app and I loved its simplicity, which is why I’m sad to see it go now that I’m switching to another app that doesn’t give me these problems. I’ll come back eventually if these bugs get fixed.

It was a decent cross-platform app, with a couple weird quirks, but the best option for me. I opted into the beta and wasn’t as fond of it, but decided to give it some time for me to adjust and explore. Some basic, useful features were lacking or implemented strangely and the UI change was a huge step back, considerably less intuitive.\n\nUnfortunately, they didn’t really improve on any of these problems for the release despite feedback from users. I know it’s impossible to give every user what they want. Plus, so many users are too entitled and demanding. That doesn’t warrant not listening to them at all, or responding flippantly and condescendingly to feedback. Many of the developer responses have been deleted because it “doesn’t represent who they are” (except ... yes it does, because that’s literally how they’re representing themselves). I’m not surprised to see the drop in their ratings, which they reset recently in hopes of erasing the negative ones, I guess?\n\nThey already have the money of existing users, so maybe they don’t feel like it’s as important to respect them. But I know I will no longer be recommending Pocket Casts to anyone else. Fortunately, there are cross-platform alternatives I look forward to checking out instead, like Castbox.","title":"Bad update, unprofessional response","userName":"idontwantafrigginnickame"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4479508066","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-07-18T11:26:48Z","rating":3,"review":"There are many good things about PocketCast (Video Support, Playback Effects, background downloading, notifications, etc.). But there are three things that bother me. 1) If you listen on an iPad and and iPhone regularly your syncing will be messed up all the time. For instance, open iPad app and watch a video show. Then open on your phone later an audio show and stop. Perhaps that evening you open your iPad again to resume the video you were watching that morning. It will sync the iPad back to your iPhone the play position of your audio podcast from that morning, not where you left off on your iPhone later in the day. I’m constantly opening Pocket Casts on my phone to find that my listening position was reverted back 20-30 minutes earlier than I left off. 2) I think the playback screen has an unnecessary bar at the bottom with the tools. Remove that bar and just put the icons for playback effects and others without it. 3) The cover art for the podcast is not centered properly on the iPhone X, XS, and XS Max iPhone. That’s just poor design.

The ability to sort by Downloaded status brings the 5 you’ve pulled down from a list of 500 to the fore. It’s strange that you cannot now, by default, tell a downloaded episode from an undownloaded one, but there’s a setting to fix that.\n\nI also appreciate the new option to delay the deletion of a completed episode for 24 hours. Combined with a new End Of Episode setting for the sleep timer, this removes the stress of falling asleep to an episode you might run off the end of.\n\nFor my uses, the only downside, and a minor one at that, is reduced information density in the episode list. You can’t see as many on a screen anymore, and the new, omnipresent Search field (rarely useful) takes up additional vertical space, making a very small knothole indeed when combined with the miniplayer and bottom toolbar. I’d suggest making Search show only when pulling from the very top of the list, as is a convention in many other apps, or just let me scroll it off the page as the episode list scrolls.","title":"Differences from 6.x to 7.3","userName":"Pinball Lizard"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1477008002","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"Monthly subscription to Pocket Casts Plus"},"isMerchandisedEnabled":false,"isMerchandisedVisibleByDefault":false,"isSubscription":true,"name":"Plus Monthly","offerName":"com.pocketcasts.plus.monthly","releaseDate":"2009-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","subscriptionFamilyId":"20544759","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/plus-monthly/id414834813"},"relationships":{"offers":{"data":[{"id":"ember31198217","type":"offer"}]}}},{"id":"1477007983","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"Yearly subscription to Pocket Casts Plus"},"isMerchandisedEnabled":false,"isMerchandisedVisibleByDefault":false,"isSubscription":true,"name":"Plus Yearly","offerName":"com.pocketcasts.plus.yearly","releaseDate":"2009-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","subscriptionFamilyId":"20544759","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/plus-yearly/id414834813"},"relationships":{"offers":{"data":[{"id":"ember31198218","type":"offer"}]}}},{"id":"335703880","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"289429962","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1389130815","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1565481562","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1139958755","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"888422857","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1080840241","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1138892702","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1215095006","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1113752736","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"396069556","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"309601447","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"979274575","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1081530898","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"288087905","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"335703883","type":"media/developer","attributes":{"genreNames":[],"name":"Automattic","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/automattic/id335703883"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6009","type":"media/genre","attributes":{"name":"News","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/id6009","parentName":"App Store","parentId":"36"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6002","type":"media/genre","attributes":{"name":"Utilities","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/id6002","parentName":"App Store","parentId":"36"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"414834813-ios","type":"media/app-platform","attributes":{"bundleId":"au.com.shiftyjelly.podcasts","editorialArtwork":{"originalFlowcaseBrick":{"width":3200,"height":600,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features/v4/a5/cf/a8/a5cfa85b-230a-67a5-22b7-8921a7398b31/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"a30000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"fddedc","textColor3":"eccbcb","textColor4":"ebb1b0"},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features128/v4/59/b6/b8/59b6b8bd-8d51-a391-033c-9aff2c132d51/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"13161a","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f15344","textColor3":"cfd0d1","textColor4":"c4473c"},"brandLogo":{"width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features124/v4/9b/96/9e/9b969ea5-0e8e-7fd7-2e1a-7ea5ce8ddf32/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor4":"b7b7b7"}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Tune in to your favourite shows.","tagline":"Listen to your favourite shows"},"hasInAppPurchases":true,"hasMessagesExtension":false,"isAppleWatchSupported":true,"isGameCenterEnabled":false,"isHiddenFromSpringboard":false,"isSiriSupported":true,"releaseDate":"2011-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","requiresGameController":false,"subtitle":"Powerful podcast player","supportsGameController":false,"supportsPassbook":false,"copyright":"© Podcast Media LLC","description":{"standard":"Pocket Casts is the world's most powerful podcast platform, an app by listeners, for listeners.Our podcast player provides next-level listening, search and discovery tools.

I put those two backwards just to trigger you.

In theory you get to fix a few things without introducing new issues. Always fun! Plus you get to write release notes, have I ever said how much I enjoy...ok...maybe that's a stretch but I do enjoy our one way interactions!\n- Added delete to the multi-select option for the Files section\n\n- Hopefully fixed an issue that could cause Pocket Casts Siri Suggestions not to have artwork\n\n- Fixed issues with our support email link not working for people who don't have the default Mail app configured\n\n- Various other small tweaks including issues with the timeline scrubber on iPad","releaseDate":"2021-02-18"},{"versionDisplay":"7.17","releaseNotes":"Welcome to 2021. The less we say about 2020 the better, so let's just talk ch-ch-chaaaanges shall we?\n- Two new high contrast themes for you to enjoy. Yes, we have gone a bit theme crazy of late, but these are handy for those of you that are a bit older like me and need more contrast in your life.\n- Turn and face the strange.\n- Some small bug fixes including one where the app was convinced the Red Velvet icon was paid. It's been a long year, easy mistake for it to make.\n- Our apologies for the complex joke in the previous update, it melted one too many brains. Here's a pretend dog photo to distract you: [cute_dog.jpg]. The imagination is a powerful thing friends, use it. And once you have, please send us a picture of the dog you imagined! Cute dogs only...is what we would have said if all dogs weren't cute...but they are...so this is a waste of breath...\n","releaseDate":"2021-02-01"},{"versionDisplay":"7.16","releaseNotes":"What has 4 letters, sometimes 9 letters, but never has 5 letters.

It's now eartasticly eargasmic.\n- Improved support for password filling and opening Pocket Casts share links.\n- Fixed quite a few bugs, including some weird ones where your tab bar could disappear, never to be seen again.\n","releaseDate":"2020-12-13"},{"versionDisplay":"7.15","releaseNotes":"Some people doubted we could get past version 7.9 without making the next one 8.0. I'm here to tell you, they were all wrong. We're at 7.15 and going strong. Maths is meaningless, numbers are virtual, the universe is finitely infinite.\n\nStuff that changed y'all (we heard y'all love that word, and you know what, it's kinda wholesome. I'm now on board with y'all, y'all):\n- There are many reasons why your listening might be interrupted for long time. An unannounced visit from an old friend. A 10-day silent meditation retreat. An unexpected holiday in maison gaol. So we now rewind a little bit when you unpause after a break, to help you remember where you were up to. You can turn this off in Settings \u003e General \u003e Intelligent Playback Resumption.\n- Speaking of long breaks, it’s probably been a while since you made a new filter. Well, we changed the steps. Now, when you create a filter, the first thing you do is actually create the filter. Once you’ve done that, give it a name, colour, and icon, and you’re on your way!\n- iOS 14 widget improvements based on your feedback. The small widget now matches the app icon and also won't take you to Discover as much.\n- Fixed an issue that could prevent custom playback effects from being saved correctly.\n- CarPlay icons tweak. These should now look correct on both light and dark CarPlay.\n- Fixed an issue with labels being cut off in Discover when the bold accessibility setting was used.\n- One person wrote us a really cool email about being able to tap to dismiss iPad episode cards. You can now tap the background to dismiss them.\n- Fixed an issue where the heading of a podcast page could be transparent and your words would scroll under it War Stars style.\n- Improved private feed support.\n- Fixed some Siri Shortcuts related issues\n","releaseDate":"2020-11-19"},{"versionDisplay":"7.14","releaseNotes":"One thing, to me, has stood out clearer than anything else in the decade or so we've been building this app. Y'all have opinions and preferences and love tweaking things. I've also realised I hate the word \"y'all\" but that literally only just happened, so let's put a pin in that and circle back, shall we? Version 7.14 brings you that sweet, sweet configuration and control you crave!\n\n- You can now choose how aggressive you want your silence trimming to be:\n  - Mild? That's how I like it.\n  - Medium? I guess I'll allow it, or...\n  - Mad Max? Yeah I get it, witness you all shiny and chrome blazing a trail through your podcasts in record time. On average that setting can easily shave 10% off how long it takes to listen to a podcast...but beware.

Not that we really understand your obsession with that here down under, but more power to you our northern cousins! This release brings:\n\n- Brand new shiny iOS 14 widgets! Yes you've been asking for them and now they are here. Use the small one instead of the app icon. Put the medium one on that fancy new widget home page you're making or just SLAP THAT GIANT ONE on your main home screen like a Pocket Casts tattoo. Loud and proud!\n- Improved iOS 14 CarPlay including some great Now Playing changes like chapter support, a mark as played button and being able to open the podcast straight from the player.\n- Fixed some performance issues when opening the Up Next list with more than 200 episodes in it. We still don't know how you're going to get through 200+ episodes, but whatever floats Jeremy's boat.\n- Speaking of Jeremy: Added the ability to tap on the podcast/chapter artwork to zoom in on it. Just in time to have missed the 2020 Jeremy's.\n- Various other fixes and improvements including pulling down episode cards being a bit wonky in the last update.","releaseDate":"2020-10-18"},{"versionDisplay":"7.12","releaseNotes":"Version 7.12 expands on the multi-select support you all seem to love, with even more enhancements:\n- We heard from a lot of you that you wanted to be able to do the reverse of some of the new actions we gave you. So now you can perform actions like un-star, un-archive, mark as unplayed and removing downloads. That's right, it's opposite day!\n- Multi-select now works for episodes in your custom files section\n- You can now re-arrange multi-select actions for Up Next\n- Fixed some issues with multi-select ordering when adding to things like Up Next\n- Improved iOS 14 support. For all those asking, yes a widget is coming soon! We're almost done putting the final few touches on it.\n- Duration filtering in an Episode filter can now be set as low as 1 minute\n- Fixed the Up Next drag handle not being visible on iOS 12 and below\n- Fixed an issue where \"Remote Skips Chapters\" wouldn't work in some cases like CarPlay and the lock screen when turned on\n- Fixed some issues with text getting cut off on the Apple Watch\n- Fixed an issue with some podcasts not having their MP3 chapters recognised properly\n- Improved the CarPlay interface for you fancy iOS 14 people.\n- Lots of other small fixes that are too overnumerous to mention.

But you know what, for once we're going to go with something a little different and let you make the jokes. Tweet us your best ones!\n\nOh you probably also want to know what's new? Well, you see, Goldilocks was complaining to us about her commute, that her New Releases filter was filled with episodes that were always either too long, or too short! We couldn’t bear to listen to this story any longer, so we added the ability to filter by duration. In any Episode Filter, tap the “Duration” chip to start limiting by length.\n\nAnd while you’re there, add even more precision by sorting your filter so that the shortest (or longest), or newest (or oldest) episodes appear at the top (or bottom). It’s up (or down) to you!\n\nI know what you're thinking, it's this kind of innovative, transformative, downright punny thinking that is going to win us some awards.

You bet your sweet little bippy it does. I know you're all desperately waiting for our 7.11 release so you can make convenience store jokes, but in the meantime:\n- We've added multi-select to episode lists throughout the app. You can now long press on any episode to perform bulk actions like archiving or downloading and more! You can also use built in drag with two fingers gesture to start a multi-select operation if you're feeling extra-dextrous.\n- The above actions are re-orderable so you can keep your favourite 2 up front and handy at all times\n- You can also long press while in multi-select mode to be given the option of selecting all the episodes above or below the current one\n- Try it out and let us know what you think!\n- Why is each of the above it's own bullet point? I don't know, force of habit!\n- We've slightly tweaked the design of the podcast page to make common functions easier. You can now show and hide archived episodes with a single tap and this setting is now per podcast. We know a lot of you have asked for that, and it's here!\n- There's also a new setting under General where you can choose whether you'd like to see archived episodes by default, changing this will also give you the option of changing it for all your current podcasts\n- As always we've fixed and improved various other small things throughout the app\n- Bullet points are your friends, people!","releaseDate":"2020-07-30"},{"versionDisplay":"7.9.1","releaseNotes":"Thanks for all your feedback on the 7.9 release, today we have some smol changes to share:\n- Fixed a number of issues where when playing podcasts on your phone, the watch app might not load to the now playing page\n- Fixed an issue where the watch app might show the wrong dates in an episode list\n- Fixed an issue with the Radioactive theme interfering with iPad trackpad scrolling\n- Download page now shows download icons to match the rest of the watch app\n- Fixed an issue with the play/pause buttons being different sizes in the watch app\n- Various other small fixes and tweaks that are really hard to type into this little box while still making any sense","releaseDate":"2020-06-29"},{"versionDisplay":"7.9","releaseNotes":"Well well well, what have we here...a major feature update.\n\nHighlights:\n- We’ve added four new app icons, so you can get closer to that perfect match of icons and background on your home screen. Or maybe you just want one for every day of the week.\n- For Pocket Casts Plus subscribers, our watch app is now strong enough to stand on its own. That's right, download for offline playback, or just straight up stream episodes from your cellular/WiFi connected watch. I'm sure you'll all aspire to use this while \"jogging\", which if you're like me really means \"walking, not even that briskly, honestly\".\n- New theme: Radioactivity. Have you been pleading for a pipboy? Do you go ga-ga for a geiger counter? Craving a cathode ray? This theme's for you. Yes, we did go a bit OTT, but it's worth it. Pocket Casts Plus only because those are the most OTT people we know. Respect.\n- Added clear button to search on podcast grid/list and discover pages\n- Much improved Trim Silence algorithm.
