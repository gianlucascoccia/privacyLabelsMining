    Great features but unstable

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Although there are no selective editing brushes, Darkroom is probably the only editor with this many editing tools that allows you to batch edit on mobile. The only thing that’s missing is some stability. It always crashes on my 5th gen iPad mini. The only things I would improve is the stability of app itself, the grain feature, because the grain gets wayyy to gritty, and a noise reduction feature. Honestly I think noise reduction would be more important than a selective brush. I could use Darkoom for event photo editing, where I barely finding myself using the selective brush, but then that leaves out a trusty noise reduction feature so I feel like it really limits my options when it comes to picking a project to edit with this app. I would still rather stick to doing the majority of my editing with Lightroom. This app came very close to opening up my workflow but that one feature of noise reduction missing is a deal breaker for me.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>If I could add one advanced feature it would be spot-selected white balance, but I&#39;m content with the controls for the most part. If I could add one basic feature that really shouldn&#39;t be an issue, though, it&#39;d be to import screenshots. Why the hell are screenshots excluded? I have this near-perfect photo editor and can&#39;t edit 1/4 of my photos. I know screenshots aren&#39;t ideal for printing but they&#39;re good for testing crops and testing edits of photos, the latter I can&#39;t do without making copies of photos thanks to this app&#39;s strange limitation. Yes I can test edits on a single image but I would have to note and undo every edit to try the next. It just seems so much more inefficient than simply allowing screenshots to be edited.<br /><br />Edit: added one star. It&#39;s good that screenshots aren&#39;t completely excluded, but I still wish they appeared in albums like normal photos do. In an attempt to declutter, per developer&#39;s response, I feel like they&#39;ve actually created more clutter in making screenshots harder to navigate and cause needless frustration by making them disappear from albums they&#39;re in. If you want to declutter the normal camera roll, that&#39;s fine, but favorites and other albums should be left alone.</p>

Today's update is all about adopting the latest and greatest in macOS Monterey, to ensure Darkroom takes full advantage of its new home. \n\n# Shortcut support on Monterey\n\nWe're excited to roll out full support for Shortcuts on macOS. This is particularly exciting for us because of all the ways that shortcuts are integrated into Monterey. You can now edit your photos right from Finder, from the menu bar, or from context menus. The full power of Darkroom's editing engine is exposed, including cropping, filters, frames, and more. This works for photos anywhere on your file system, not only those in iCloud Photo Library!\n\n# RAW Smart Album on Monterey \u0026 iOS 15\n\nThis has been one of our most requested features. Our library sidebar and album selector now lists a RAW Smart Album that conveniently collects all of your RAW and RAW+JPEG photos in one place.\n\n# Clarity is available on Monterey\n\nFinally! Clarity arrives to the Mac with Monterey! Clarity was on iPhones and iPads exclusively due to technical constraints, but we're thrilled to see it on macOS. This provides editing parity across all the platforms we support!\n\n# Keyboard Navigation\n\nFor many people on the Mac and iPad, using our keyboard shortcuts allows them to quickly navigate through Darkroom. With Monterey Apple made available more tools for us to deepen Darkrooms support for keyboard navigation.\n\nPlease read our announcement on our blog for a full list of new keyboard commands and changes.\n\n# Zoom Improvement\n\nOn Monterey, you'll notice a new slider to handle zooming in and out in the toolbar. This part of a larger effort to continuously refine and improve all the important little details that make your editing experience shine and keep you in the flow. Zooming in Darkroom is now a much more fluid and efficient experience.\n\n# Under the Hood improvements\n\nLots of effort was spent in this update cycle on cleaning up parts of the codebase that have not been touched in a long time. This will result in lots of small bugs being fixed, small performance improvements everywhere that will result in a smoother editing experience, and a lot of little refinements that help us stay at the top of the iOS, iPadOS, and macOS photo editing game.\n\nThank you to all our subscribers who help support our ability to not just cram new features into every release, but also take the time to improve what already exists.","releaseDate":"2021-10-25"},{"versionDisplay":"5.6.2","releaseNotes":"- Fixed Portrait Photo showing rendering glitches.\n- Fixed an issue causing the crash while exporting with Copy Hashtags option included.","releaseDate":"2021-10-07"},{"versionDisplay":"5.6.1","releaseNotes":"This one is a bit smaller than our normal releases, but that's just because we're so busy working on some really exciting changes coming soon. Mainly house-keeping stuff in this update. Stay tuned!\n\n- Fix the crash preventing you from opening app Settings.\n- Improve performance of panning around image while zoomed in.\n- Show accurate time estimates when exporting videos.\n- Fix our top two crashes.\n- Fix performance regression affecting editing responsiveness.","releaseDate":"2021-10-01"},{"versionDisplay":"5.6","releaseNotes":"For this release, we made our way through the list of rough edges in the Darkroom experience. Lots and lots of bug fixes here!\n\n### Image Loading\n\n- We rebuilt our image loading and generation infrastructure to provide faster image delivery, more accurate results, and improve reliability.\n- When editing a photo, we now pause library work that might interrupt your interaction with the sliders.\n- All image views in the app now share the same image provider, ensuring they’re all up to date, share resources, and are fast/reliable.\n- Fixes issues where images got stuck loading forever.\n- Fixes issues that caused thumbnails to be blurry in the grid after editing.\n- Fixes rendering glitches when backgrounding the app quickly while editing.\n- Fixes a bug where cropped and/or framed images would stretch if you open the Crop Tool.\n- We use a lot less memory in our caching layer, ensuring sliders stay responsive and stable.\n\n### RAW + JPG Photos\n\n- Added a new setting to define what version you want to load by default. This allows us to skip asking you every time if you want to change the default when switching.\n- Fixed an issue that could cause the RAW photos to appear too small, and JPEGs to show visual glitches when switching between the two.\n- Fixed an issue that could cause RAW photos to display their dark regions too brightly.\n\n### Crop \u0026 Transform\n\n- Improved crop aspect ratio option by making the selection of the “As Shot” and “Free” options sticky across edit sessions.\n- Fixed an issue that caused crop corner controls to not properly settle on the edges if moving quickly past an edge.\n- Fixed an issue that caused crop controls to not respond if your drag gesture was slow to start moving.\n- Fixed a rare issue that could cause the crop controls to disappear!\n- Fixed a lot of alignment and visual layout issues with the Transform tool.\n- When cropping, we now disable the gesture to dismiss the tools, which could get in your way of cropping.\n\n### Photos App Extension\n\n- Improved memory use in our Photos Extension, making it more stable\n- The Clarity slider is still using too much memory and causing the photo extension to crash, so we decided to removed it from the Photos Extension until we can address its memory use.\n\n### Exporting\n\n- When you are exporting, we now pause all other image processing to speed up the export, and provide it as much memory as possible.\n- We now re-use a lot more memory between editing and export, reducing the memory load of the app, and ensuring exporting jobs always have the memory it needs to finish their job.\n- Improved HDR video export by ensuring it now exports to SDR with the correct colors. When we support end-to-end HDR editing \u0026 exporting, we will re-enable HDR exports.\n- Fix a bug where exporting 4K videos with a frame would crash\n- On iPhone, during export, the interface no longer adjusts to device rotation, which helps reduce memory usage and improves stability and reliability of exports.\n\n### **UI Improvements**\n\n- If the app interface is fully hidden (by tapping on the image to view it full-screen), we now allow you to swipe to dismiss to go back to the library.\n- Fixed some layout issues with the batch toolbar, particularly on iPad.\n- Fixed our in-app announcement message not auto dismiss if you tapped to read the announcement post.\n- Improved the Flag \u0026 Reject bar when swiping to reveal it when also have the edit tools open, now this won’t force the edit tools to collapse, but the Flag \u0026 Reject bar will auto collapse after using them. This way you have a quick way to flag or reject.\n- When picking a photo to add to an album on Mac, double-clicking on a photo will now add it to that album.\n- Fixed side swipe quick start of multi selection showing in the photo picker.\n\nThere are lots of other issues addressed, but we couldn't fit them here ;( So please head over to the website for the full list.","releaseDate":"2021-08-11"},{"versionDisplay":"5.5","releaseNotes":"We've rebuilt the Grain slider from the ground up to reduce memory usage, improve speed and aesthetic as well as make it look closer to film grain.\n\n- The image will now appear to be made up of grain rather than the grain being applied over the top as an overlay. This is particularly evident in bright areas.\n- Adding grain to videos no longer affects the playback frame rate.\n- Fixed a memory related crash when exporting large images with grain.\n- Fixed grain in the Photos extension being too big.\n- Eliminated artifacts and repetitive patterns within the grain.\n- Improved grain for video by making it smaller.\n\n### Crop \u0026 Transform\n\n- Fixed unresponsive perspective transform sliders on iPad when using a trackpad.\n- Fixed the crop center handle from disappearing when zooming in.\n- Improved crop using aspect ratio crop by now always fitting width/height from the center.\n- Fixed the transform on a depth map preview of a portrait depth photo not being applied.\n- Fixed crop history entries being overwritten when reverting a photo and selecting old edits.\n- Fixed unnecessary history entries created when entering the crop tool showing.\n- Fixed the wrong crop cursor size showing for some corners on macOS.\n\n### Memory\n\n- Fixed a memory issue that caused tools to use more memory than needed.\n- Fixed a memory related crash which could occur when exporting portrait photos.\n- Fixed a memory related crash which could occur when exporting multiple videos.\n- Fixed a memory related crash which could occur when exporting RAW photos.\n- Fixed a memory related crash which could occur merging albums.\n- Improved the image cache for portrait photos.\n\n### Bonus\n\n- Improved the loading indicators when viewing a photo to now make an explicit difference between loading data locally from storage, and downloading data from iCloud.\n- Improved the interaction with the home indicator when the tools are open while editing.\n- Improved export by ensuring a saved copy is always added to the same album as the original.\n- Added a prompt to replace edits if existing local edits are different from remote edits.\n- Fixed an issue that could cause filter thumbnails not to load.\n- Fixed an issue which could show an incorrect rejected count.\n- Fixed an issue where the app would get stuck in Limited Photo Library Access state on macOS.\n- Fixed some the Limited Photo Library Access controls overlapping with the home button.\n- Fixed the frame background color not animating when switching colors.\n- Improved the toolbar Flag \u0026 Reject arrow and Transform tap target being too close.\n- Improved the feedback option to contact us to work more reliably.","releaseDate":"2021-07-13"},{"versionDisplay":"5.4.2","releaseNotes":"New in this release:\n- Fixed an issue causing an app to freeze when applying a Filter to a Video or opening certain Portrait Photos","releaseDate":"2021-07-02"},{"versionDisplay":"5.4.1","releaseNotes":"New in this release:\n- Fixed an issue causing a crash or being stuck when exporting a photo with Grain added","releaseDate":"2021-06-29"},{"versionDisplay":"5.4","releaseNotes":"New: Expanded Editing \u0026 Management Siri Shortcuts\n\nOur new Edit With Darkroom Shortcut allows you to use our editing and exporting capabilities right within a Shortcut workflow.

If you review a photo/video that is not in your iCloud Photo Library, the action will import it automatically.\n\nThis update also fixes a lot of small issues that impacted the responsiveness and performance of editing RAW images in Darkroom. \n\nPlease provide any feedback on missing features you'd like to see us add, and details about how this integrates into your workflows.\n\nThank you for testing Darkroom!","releaseDate":"2021-06-21"},{"versionDisplay":"5.3.3","releaseNotes":"New in this release:\n- Fixed a problem that was causing the app to crash when exporting with  white colored frame\n- Fixed a problem causing Clarity to crash because of an internal error","releaseDate":"2021-06-07"},{"versionDisplay":"5.3.2","releaseNotes":"New in this release:\n- Fixed top crashes related to exporting photos, editing Portrait photos\n- Improved stability of the  Photo Extension, especially when adding Frames\n- Fixed a bug causing video playback to slow down\n- Fixed a problem causing video export to stop (AVEncoderBitDepthHintKey related) \n- Fixed a problem causing crashes when exporting with very large watermark images\n- Other minor improvements","releaseDate":"2021-06-05"},{"versionDisplay":"5.3.1","releaseNotes":"We're excited to flesh out our editing suite with one of our most requested features ever: Clarity!

Decrease Clarity.\nWant more to enhance the drama or texture in a photo? Increase Clarity.\n\nWe iterated for a long time to give you a simple slider that incorporates a lot of refinement and complexity. As you start dragging, the effect is subtle. As you continue dragging to the edges, the effect gets stronger. This gives you the ability to either make fine adjustments for portraits, or go beyond for dramatic landscapes using one single \u0026 smart tool.\n\nAlongside the new Clarity slider, this update also includes other bug fixes and further performance improvements:\n\n- Improved (Pro)RAW highlights and shadows detail recovery, especially when HDR data is present.\n- Improved overall portrait depth editing handling:\n    - Improved blur and depth editing performance greatly.\n    - Adjusting the depth mask now also previews the blur adjustments in realtime.\n    - Fixed render glitches that could sometimes occur on portrait photos.\n    - Fixed a potential memory related crash when exporting portrait photos.\n- Improved memory usage during export.\n- Improved handling for 16-bit TIFF exports.\n- Fixed an issue where we could load the wrong size RAW if it had a cropped JPG attached.\n- Fixed a crash that could happen when adding a photo to an album when editing a photo.\n- Fixed a crash that could happen when renaming an album.\n- Fixed some strings in the Export dialog not being properly translated.\n- Fixed active edits in Crop/Transform tool not being exported when in the tool.\n- Fixed on iPad/Mac ESC keyboard shortcut dismissing photo when in the transform tool.\n- Fixed batch actions showing for Shared Albums where the can’t be used.\n- Added Mac Sidebar width restoring when opening a window.\n- Added on iPad a new default for Photostrip to always open when viewing a photo.\n- Added 3 new and fun Darkroom+  App Icon variants: Panda, 80's, and Swirl.\n\n***Note:** due to an Apple macOS bug Clarity is not available on macOS 11.3 and 11.4, but is on earlier versions. We hope to resolve the issue with Apple as soon as we can.*","releaseDate":"2021-05-15"},{"versionDisplay":"5.3","releaseNotes":"We're excited to flesh out our editing suite with one of our most requested features ever: Clarity!

This gives you the ability to either make fine adjustments for portraits, or go beyond for dramatic landscapes using one single \u0026 smart tool.\n\nAlongside the new Clarity slider, this update also includes other bug fixes and further performance improvements:\n\n- Improved (Pro)RAW highlights and shadows detail recovery, especially when HDR data is present.\n- Improved overall portrait depth editing handling:\n    - Improved blur and depth editing performance greatly.\n    - Adjusting the depth mask now also previews the blur adjustments in realtime.\n    - Fixed render glitches that could sometimes occur on portrait photos.\n    - Fixed a potential memory related crash when exporting portrait photos.\n- Improved memory usage during export.\n- Improved handling for 16-bit TIFF exports.\n- Fixed an issue where we could load the wrong size RAW if it had a cropped JPG attached.\n- Fixed a crash that could happen when adding a photo to an album when editing a photo.\n- Fixed a crash that could happen when renaming an album.\n- Fixed some strings in the Export dialog not being properly translated.\n- Fixed active edits in Crop/Transform tool not being exported when in the tool.\n- Fixed on iPad/Mac ESC keyboard shortcut dismissing photo when in the transform tool.\n- Fixed batch actions showing for Shared Albums where the can’t be used.\n- Added Mac Sidebar width restoring when opening a window.\n- Added on iPad a new default for Photostrip to always open when viewing a photo.\n- Added 3 new and fun Darkroom+  App Icon variants: Panda, 80's, and Swirl.\n\n***Note:** due to an Apple macOS bug Clarity is not available on macOS 11.3 and 11.4, but is on earlier versions. We hope to resolve the issue with Apple as soon as we can.*","releaseDate":"2021-05-13"},{"versionDisplay":"5.2.3","releaseNotes":"- We're re-introducing the Screenshot filter as a Setting!

Getting to the right photo and knowing which one to edit however, can feel like work.\nToday we're taking a big step forward to making all this fun \u0026 super fast with a new workflow to cull and review your photos: Flag your highlights, and Reject the bad ones.\nWhen you make one of those choices, we'll automatically advance you to the next photo so you can get in a ~flow state~ and zoom through your latest batch of imports in no time.\n\n# How to use the new Review Features\nOn the iPhone, swipe right on the editing toolbar, and you can start flagging and rejecting. As you tap, Darkroom will automatically advance you to the next photo.\nOn the iPad \u0026 Mac, you'll see new icons to Flag and Reject alongside the existing Favorite and Delete options. Keyboard shortcuts will help you also quickly categorize a photo and move to the next one.\n\n# Batch processing gets a lot of love too\nBatch actions are becoming more powerful and more useful, so we \nadded a new gesture to let you start selecting photos much more efficiently. Now, you can just horizontally swipe on any image to start selecting.\nThe visual design also gets a refresh, keeping it in line with the iPad \u0026 Mac, and because we had to fit two new actions, we decided to make the Actions bar scrollable, so everything can breath a little.\n\n# Finding your Flags and Rejects in Other Apps\nWhen you use our Flagging and Rejecting features for the first time, Darkroom will create a new \"Darkroom\" Folder in your system photo library, and inside it create 3 new albums: Exported, Rejected, and Flagged.\nAs you perform Review actions inside Darkroom, these actions are reflected automatically in those Albums, allowing you to find recently flagged photos anywhere on your phone.\nIf you have iCloud Photo Library, these albums will be synced to all your devices, so Review actions are automatically synced to all your devices!\nBecause Rejected photos are typically your least favorite photos, we've also made it easy to quickly delete them all, either at the end of you editing session, or in the Album picker.\n\n# Making Hyper-Fast Review Possible\nYou'll notice a lot of speed and responsiveness improvements in this app. This  is due to a big infrastructure undertaking that dramatically reduced the amount of data downloaded, memory created, and spinners shown when you navigate through your photo library in the editing interface.\nStarting with today's update, if the editing tools are not visible, we skip the heavy work of downloading and initializing the full-quality image, and instead show you a Smart Preview of the photo. This allows you to navigate through your photo library in Darkroom at the same speed as the native Photos app. In fact, the editing interface much more responsive in general.","releaseDate":"2021-03-29"},{"versionDisplay":"5.1.5","releaseNotes":"This update fixes the following issues:\n- Fixed a crash when Photo Library is not available on Mac\n- Fixed sharing to Instagram using native share sheet and Instagram share extension\n- Fixed Crop Tool controls and their responsiveness.\n- Fixed a typo in the Export Sheet.\n- Made sure Histogram is shown when swiping to open the workspace.","releaseDate":"2021-02-12"},{"versionDisplay":"5.1.2","releaseNotes":"# This update fixes the following issues:\n\n- Fixes a crash-on-launch affecting devices using iOS 12\n- Fixes a layout bug causing the photo grid to break its layout in some cases\n- Fixes a bug causing edit retrieval to fail for some kinds of edits\n- Fixes a crash that occurred when dismissing a photo or video in some cases\n- By default, the Photo Strip is now centered, rather than being scrolled to the bottom.","releaseDate":"2020-12-20"},{"versionDisplay":"5.1.1","releaseNotes":"This update adds support for ProRAW photos on iOS 14.3.

This is particularly exciting for us because of all the ways that shortcuts are integrated into Monterey. You can now edit your photos right from Finder, from the menu bar, or from context menus. The full power of Darkroom's editing engine is exposed, including cropping, filters, frames, and more.

Clarity arrives to the Mac with Monterey! Clarity was on iPhones and iPads exclusively due to technical constraints, but we're thrilled to see it on macOS. This provides editing parity across all the platforms we support!\n\n# Keyboard Navigation\n\nFor many people on the Mac and iPad, using our keyboard shortcuts allows them to quickly navigate through Darkroom. With Monterey Apple made available more tools for us to deepen Darkrooms support for keyboard navigation.\n\nPlease read our announcement on our blog for a full list of new keyboard commands and changes.\n\n# Zoom Improvement\n\nOn Monterey, you'll notice a new slider to handle zooming in and out in the toolbar. This part of a larger effort to continuously refine and improve all the important little details that make your editing experience shine and keep you in the flow. Zooming in Darkroom is now a much more fluid and efficient experience.\n\n# Under the Hood improvements\n\nLots of effort was spent in this update cycle on cleaning up parts of the codebase that have not been touched in a long time. This will result in lots of small bugs being fixed, small performance improvements everywhere that will result in a smoother editing experience, and a lot of little refinements that help us stay at the top of the iOS, iPadOS, and macOS photo editing game.\n\nThank you to all our subscribers who help support our ability to not just cram new features into every release, but also take the time to improve what already exists.","releaseDate":"2021-10-25"},{"versionDisplay":"5.6.2","releaseNotes":"- Fixed Portrait Photo showing rendering glitches.\n- Fixed an issue causing the crash while exporting with Copy Hashtags option included.","releaseDate":"2021-10-07"},{"versionDisplay":"5.6.1","releaseNotes":"This one is a bit smaller than our normal releases, but that's just because we're so busy working on some really exciting changes coming soon.

Lots and lots of bug fixes here!\n\n### Image Loading\n\n- We rebuilt our image loading and generation infrastructure to provide faster image delivery, more accurate results, and improve reliability.\n- When editing a photo, we now pause library work that might interrupt your interaction with the sliders.\n- All image views in the app now share the same image provider, ensuring they’re all up to date, share resources, and are fast/reliable.\n- Fixes issues where images got stuck loading forever.\n- Fixes issues that caused thumbnails to be blurry in the grid after editing.\n- Fixes rendering glitches when backgrounding the app quickly while editing.\n- Fixes a bug where cropped and/or framed images would stretch if you open the Crop Tool.\n- We use a lot less memory in our caching layer, ensuring sliders stay responsive and stable.\n\n### RAW + JPG Photos\n\n- Added a new setting to define what version you want to load by default. This allows us to skip asking you every time if you want to change the default when switching.\n- Fixed an issue that could cause the RAW photos to appear too small, and JPEGs to show visual glitches when switching between the two.\n- Fixed an issue that could cause RAW photos to display their dark regions too brightly.\n\n### Crop \u0026 Transform\n\n- Improved crop aspect ratio option by making the selection of the “As Shot” and “Free” options sticky across edit sessions.\n- Fixed an issue that caused crop corner controls to not properly settle on the edges if moving quickly past an edge.\n- Fixed an issue that caused crop controls to not respond if your drag gesture was slow to start moving.\n- Fixed a rare issue that could cause the crop controls to disappear!\n- Fixed a lot of alignment and visual layout issues with the Transform tool.\n- When cropping, we now disable the gesture to dismiss the tools, which could get in your way of cropping.\n\n### Photos App Extension\n\n- Improved memory use in our Photos Extension, making it more stable\n- The Clarity slider is still using too much memory and causing the photo extension to crash, so we decided to removed it from the Photos Extension until we can address its memory use.\n\n### Exporting\n\n- When you are exporting, we now pause all other image processing to speed up the export, and provide it as much memory as possible.\n- We now re-use a lot more memory between editing and export, reducing the memory load of the app, and ensuring exporting jobs always have the memory it needs to finish their job.\n- Improved HDR video export by ensuring it now exports to SDR with the correct colors. When we support end-to-end HDR editing \u0026 exporting, we will re-enable HDR exports.\n- Fix a bug where exporting 4K videos with a frame would crash\n- On iPhone, during export, the interface no longer adjusts to device rotation, which helps reduce memory usage and improves stability and reliability of exports.\n\n### **UI Improvements**\n\n- If the app interface is fully hidden (by tapping on the image to view it full-screen), we now allow you to swipe to dismiss to go back to the library.\n- Fixed some layout issues with the batch toolbar, particularly on iPad.\n- Fixed our in-app announcement message not auto dismiss if you tapped to read the announcement post.\n- Improved the Flag \u0026 Reject bar when swiping to reveal it when also have the edit tools open, now this won’t force the edit tools to collapse, but the Flag \u0026 Reject bar will auto collapse after using them. This way you have a quick way to flag or reject.\n- When picking a photo to add to an album on Mac, double-clicking on a photo will now add it to that album.\n- Fixed side swipe quick start of multi selection showing in the photo picker.\n\nThere are lots of other issues addressed, but we couldn't fit them here ;( So please head over to the website for the full list.","releaseDate":"2021-08-11"},{"versionDisplay":"5.5","releaseNotes":"We've rebuilt the Grain slider from the ground up to reduce memory usage, improve speed and aesthetic as well as make it look closer to film grain.\n\n- The image will now appear to be made up of grain rather than the grain being applied over the top as an overlay. This is particularly evident in bright areas.\n- Adding grain to videos no longer affects the playback frame rate.\n- Fixed a memory related crash when exporting large images with grain.\n- Fixed grain in the Photos extension being too big.\n- Eliminated artifacts and repetitive patterns within the grain.\n- Improved grain for video by making it smaller.\n\n### Crop \u0026 Transform\n\n- Fixed unresponsive perspective transform sliders on iPad when using a trackpad.\n- Fixed the crop center handle from disappearing when zooming in.\n- Improved crop using aspect ratio crop by now always fitting width/height from the center.\n- Fixed the transform on a depth map preview of a portrait depth photo not being applied.\n- Fixed crop history entries being overwritten when reverting a photo and selecting old edits.\n- Fixed unnecessary history entries created when entering the crop tool showing.\n- Fixed the wrong crop cursor size showing for some corners on macOS.\n\n### Memory\n\n- Fixed a memory issue that caused tools to use more memory than needed.\n- Fixed a memory related crash which could occur when exporting portrait photos.\n- Fixed a memory related crash which could occur when exporting multiple videos.\n- Fixed a memory related crash which could occur when exporting RAW photos.\n- Fixed a memory related crash which could occur merging albums.\n- Improved the image cache for portrait photos.\n\n### Bonus\n\n- Improved the loading indicators when viewing a photo to now make an explicit difference between loading data locally from storage, and downloading data from iCloud.\n- Improved the interaction with the home indicator when the tools are open while editing.\n- Improved export by ensuring a saved copy is always added to the same album as the original.\n- Added a prompt to replace edits if existing local edits are different from remote edits.\n- Fixed an issue that could cause filter thumbnails not to load.\n- Fixed an issue which could show an incorrect rejected count.\n- Fixed an issue where the app would get stuck in Limited Photo Library Access state on macOS.\n- Fixed some the Limited Photo Library Access controls overlapping with the home button.\n- Fixed the frame background color not animating when switching colors.\n- Improved the toolbar Flag \u0026 Reject arrow and Transform tap target being too close.\n- Improved the feedback option to contact us to work more reliably.","releaseDate":"2021-07-13"},{"versionDisplay":"5.4.2","releaseNotes":"New in this release:\n- Fixed an issue causing an app to freeze when applying a Filter to a Video or opening certain Portrait Photos","releaseDate":"2021-07-02"},{"versionDisplay":"5.4.1","releaseNotes":"New in this release:\n- Fixed an issue causing a crash or being stuck when exporting a photo with Grain added","releaseDate":"2021-06-29"},{"versionDisplay":"5.4","releaseNotes":"New: Expanded Editing \u0026 Management Siri Shortcuts\n\nOur new Edit With Darkroom Shortcut allows you to use our editing and exporting capabilities right within a Shortcut workflow.

Getting to the right photo and knowing which one to edit however, can feel like work.\nToday we're taking a big step forward to making all this fun \u0026 super fast with a new workflow to cull and review your photos: Flag your highlights, and Reject the bad ones.\nWhen you make one of those choices, we'll automatically advance you to the next photo so you can get in a ~flow state~ and zoom through your latest batch of imports in no time.\n\n# How to use the new Review Features\nOn the iPhone, swipe right on the editing toolbar, and you can start flagging and rejecting. As you tap, Darkroom will automatically advance you to the next photo.\nOn the iPad \u0026 Mac, you'll see new icons to Flag and Reject alongside the existing Favorite and Delete options. Keyboard shortcuts will help you also quickly categorize a photo and move to the next one.\n\n# Batch processing gets a lot of love too\nBatch actions are becoming more powerful and more useful, so we \nadded a new gesture to let you start selecting photos much more efficiently. Now, you can just horizontally swipe on any image to start selecting.\nThe visual design also gets a refresh, keeping it in line with the iPad \u0026 Mac, and because we had to fit two new actions, we decided to make the Actions bar scrollable, so everything can breath a little.\n\n# Finding your Flags and Rejects in Other Apps\nWhen you use our Flagging and Rejecting features for the first time, Darkroom will create a new \"Darkroom\" Folder in your system photo library, and inside it create 3 new albums: Exported, Rejected, and Flagged.\nAs you perform Review actions inside Darkroom, these actions are reflected automatically in those Albums, allowing you to find recently flagged photos anywhere on your phone.\nIf you have iCloud Photo Library, these albums will be synced to all your devices, so Review actions are automatically synced to all your devices!\nBecause Rejected photos are typically your least favorite photos, we've also made it easy to quickly delete them all, either at the end of you editing session, or in the Album picker.\n\n# Making Hyper-Fast Review Possible\nYou'll notice a lot of speed and responsiveness improvements in this app. This  is due to a big infrastructure undertaking that dramatically reduced the amount of data downloaded, memory created, and spinners shown when you navigate through your photo library in the editing interface.\nStarting with today's update, if the editing tools are not visible, we skip the heavy work of downloading and initializing the full-quality image, and instead show you a Smart Preview of the photo. This allows you to navigate through your photo library in Darkroom at the same speed as the native Photos app. In fact, the editing interface much more responsive in general.","releaseDate":"2021-03-29"},{"versionDisplay":"5.1.5","releaseNotes":"This update fixes the following issues:\n- Fixed a crash when Photo Library is not available on Mac\n- Fixed sharing to Instagram using native share sheet and Instagram share extension\n- Fixed Crop Tool controls and their responsiveness.\n- Fixed a typo in the Export Sheet.\n- Made sure Histogram is shown when swiping to open the workspace.","releaseDate":"2021-02-12"},{"versionDisplay":"5.1.3","releaseNotes":"# This update fixes the following issues:\n\n- Fixes a crash-on-launch affecting devices using iOS 12\n- Fixes a layout bug causing the photo grid to break its layout in some cases\n- Fixes a bug causing edit retrieval to fail for some kinds of edits\n- Fixes a crash that occurred when dismissing a photo or video in some cases\n- By default, the Photo Strip is now centered, rather than being scrolled to the bottom.","releaseDate":"2020-12-20"},{"versionDisplay":"5.1.1","releaseNotes":"This update adds support for ProRAW photos on iOS 14.3.

The only thing that’s missing is some stability. It always crashes on my 5th gen iPad mini. The only things I would improve is the stability of app itself, the grain feature, because the grain gets wayyy to gritty, and a noise reduction feature. Honestly I think noise reduction would be more important than a selective brush. I could use Darkoom for event photo editing, where I barely finding myself using the selective brush, but then that leaves out a trusty noise reduction feature so I feel like it really limits my options when it comes to picking a project to edit with this app. I would still rather stick to doing the majority of my editing with Lightroom. This app came very close to opening up my workflow but that one feature of noise reduction missing is a deal breaker for me.","title":"Great features but unstable","userName":"CERDABOI"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4774523612","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-09-14T08:10:56Z","developerResponse":{"id":10668694,"body":"Screenshots are there, we just hide theme to declutter.

If I could add one basic feature that really shouldn't be an issue, though, it'd be to import screenshots. Why the hell are screenshots excluded? I have this near-perfect photo editor and can't edit 1/4 of my photos. I know screenshots aren't ideal for printing but they're good for testing crops and testing edits of photos, the latter I can't do without making copies of photos thanks to this app's strange limitation. Yes I can test edits on a single image but I would have to note and undo every edit to try the next. It just seems so much more inefficient than simply allowing screenshots to be edited.\n\nEdit: added one star. It's good that screenshots aren't completely excluded, but I still wish they appeared in albums like normal photos do. In an attempt to declutter, per developer's response, I feel like they've actually created more clutter in making screenshots harder to navigate and cause needless frustration by making them disappear from albums they're in. If you want to declutter the normal camera roll, that's fine, but favorites and other albums should be left alone.","title":"Screenshots are pictures too","userName":"Brandon_219"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5998106619","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-05-26T23:35:32Z","developerResponse":{"id":15852044,"body":"Thank you for your kind words.

Recently, I’ve opened the app up and come across a message detailing their new subscription model. Ok, I understand. The next decade in app development will bring about mind blowing features and it’s important to have the ability to finance that. With that said, I was given two options: continue using the app with no additional cost, or subscribe for a reduced rate. Although I chose the free option, I am impressed and happy that the developers have chosen to allow the end user an option like this instead of forcing a subscription. I’m much more willing to support developers like this in the future. And if I used the app more often than I do, I likely would have gone the subscription route.

They give you enough free options to keep your interest and let you test the paid features before you decide to purchase. No annoying ads is a plus. It’s not easy to commit these days as you don’t know how things will turn out but it’s one of the few apps that I haven’t deleted after running into something unbearable.  \n\nI really like some of the film like filters. I hope there will be more refinement in that area based on some professional coloring techniques to get a really pro look to photos and videos. It can be a challenge to get good color in your still and moving images. This app’s filters don’t feel cheap. \n\nOnly thing that bugs me now is you can edit a slow motion video.  It becomes normal speed. I don’t know if can be slowed back down after exported but it’s difficult to work on something meant to be viewed slowly while it’s moving rapidly.  \n\nOtherwise I’d say keep up the good work! It’s beautiful app full of functional features and booming with more potential.  \n\nFor now the only other apps in my personal use that compete with this app are the photoshop apps, even though they can also do layers. For video so far I still rely on my desktop software even though I believe mobile edit is the future.

But for a quick edit with some nice filters curves perspective cropping and sending previews to clients or even personal use this works well.  What I really like is I don’t have to save as a edited image and duplicate files since all edits are non destructive and can easily revert to originals.  \n\nMy suggestion for the developers would be people like me would love more functionality that more closely resembles what I can do on Lightroom or photoshop.  I know that means more cost but off top of my head I would really like things like \n1) stitching images for panoramas\n2) focus stacking\n3) spot removal (brush tool)\n4) masks (for local edits)\n5) hdr \n6) more filters esp for B\u0026W.  I would pay for these.  Carbon has some good ones.\n7) Gaussian blurs\n8) gradients\n9) selective coloring (making eyes whiter, teeth whiter etc)\n\nI realize this may be a sophisticated set of functions for a mobile app but hopefully in future it is available.","title":"Very useful even for Pros","userName":"Besdayz"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3559259299","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-12-22T12:16:55Z","developerResponse":{"id":6514193,"body":"Sorry for the inconvenience.

It is tightly integrated with halide and other camera apps, and the amount of control available in the app is amazing. I also love that you can super easily switch between raw and other versions of your pics. So the reason I just can’t love this app is because for me it is unusable. I am using halide to shoot raw photos and when I edit them in darkroom as soon as I zoom in close on a raw photo and try to pan the view, the app crashes. This happened every time with any raw photo weather it was shot on halide or another iPhone app, or shot on my Sony a6300 and imported through photos app. I have tried deleting the app and rebooting then reinstalling but it just does the same thing with raw photos.

Apple, how can you continually highlight this app when you see some of the responses by the developers? You continually suggest you aren’t a pro app, only a team of two etc. That’s fine, then I would suggest making the price less, or even free, until it’s fully ready and it might help you build a loyal following. Most would consider that price point to have a fully polished app ready to work in every way. Just don’t be offended when people who really care make suggestions.

Today's update is all about adopting the latest and greatest in macOS Monterey, to ensure Darkroom takes full advantage of its new home. \n\n# Shortcut support on Monterey\n\nWe're excited to roll out full support for Shortcuts on macOS. This is particularly exciting for us because of all the ways that shortcuts are integrated into Monterey. You can now edit your photos right from Finder, from the menu bar, or from context menus. The full power of Darkroom's editing engine is exposed, including cropping, filters, frames, and more. This works for photos anywhere on your file system, not only those in iCloud Photo Library!\n\n# RAW Smart Album on Monterey \u0026 iOS 15\n\nThis has been one of our most requested features. Our library sidebar and album selector now lists a RAW Smart Album that conveniently collects all of your RAW and RAW+JPEG photos in one place.\n\n# Clarity is available on Monterey\n\nFinally! Clarity arrives to the Mac with Monterey! Clarity was on iPhones and iPads exclusively due to technical constraints, but we're thrilled to see it on macOS. This provides editing parity across all the platforms we support!\n\n# Keyboard Navigation\n\nFor many people on the Mac and iPad, using our keyboard shortcuts allows them to quickly navigate through Darkroom. With Monterey Apple made available more tools for us to deepen Darkrooms support for keyboard navigation.\n\nPlease read our announcement on our blog for a full list of new keyboard commands and changes.\n\n# Zoom Improvement\n\nOn Monterey, you'll notice a new slider to handle zooming in and out in the toolbar. This part of a larger effort to continuously refine and improve all the important little details that make your editing experience shine and keep you in the flow. Zooming in Darkroom is now a much more fluid and efficient experience.\n\n# Under the Hood improvements\n\nLots of effort was spent in this update cycle on cleaning up parts of the codebase that have not been touched in a long time. This will result in lots of small bugs being fixed, small performance improvements everywhere that will result in a smoother editing experience, and a lot of little refinements that help us stay at the top of the iOS, iPadOS, and macOS photo editing game.\n\nThank you to all our subscribers who help support our ability to not just cram new features into every release, but also take the time to improve what already exists.","releaseDate":"2021-10-25"},{"versionDisplay":"5.6.2","releaseNotes":"- Fixed Portrait Photo showing rendering glitches.\n- Fixed an issue causing the crash while exporting with Copy Hashtags option included.","releaseDate":"2021-10-07"},{"versionDisplay":"5.6.1","releaseNotes":"This one is a bit smaller than our normal releases, but that's just because we're so busy working on some really exciting changes coming soon.

Lots and lots of bug fixes here!\n\n### Image Loading\n\n- We rebuilt our image loading and generation infrastructure to provide faster image delivery, more accurate results, and improve reliability.\n- When editing a photo, we now pause library work that might interrupt your interaction with the sliders.\n- All image views in the app now share the same image provider, ensuring they’re all up to date, share resources, and are fast/reliable.\n- Fixes issues where images got stuck loading forever.\n- Fixes issues that caused thumbnails to be blurry in the grid after editing.\n- Fixes rendering glitches when backgrounding the app quickly while editing.\n- Fixes a bug where cropped and/or framed images would stretch if you open the Crop Tool.\n- We use a lot less memory in our caching layer, ensuring sliders stay responsive and stable.\n\n### RAW + JPG Photos\n\n- Added a new setting to define what version you want to load by default. This allows us to skip asking you every time if you want to change the default when switching.\n- Fixed an issue that could cause the RAW photos to appear too small, and JPEGs to show visual glitches when switching between the two.\n- Fixed an issue that could cause RAW photos to display their dark regions too brightly.\n\n### Crop \u0026 Transform\n\n- Improved crop aspect ratio option by making the selection of the “As Shot” and “Free” options sticky across edit sessions.\n- Fixed an issue that caused crop corner controls to not properly settle on the edges if moving quickly past an edge.\n- Fixed an issue that caused crop controls to not respond if your drag gesture was slow to start moving.\n- Fixed a rare issue that could cause the crop controls to disappear!\n- Fixed a lot of alignment and visual layout issues with the Transform tool.\n- When cropping, we now disable the gesture to dismiss the tools, which could get in your way of cropping.\n\n### Photos App Extension\n\n- Improved memory use in our Photos Extension, making it more stable\n- The Clarity slider is still using too much memory and causing the photo extension to crash, so we decided to removed it from the Photos Extension until we can address its memory use.\n\n### Exporting\n\n- When you are exporting, we now pause all other image processing to speed up the export, and provide it as much memory as possible.\n- We now re-use a lot more memory between editing and export, reducing the memory load of the app, and ensuring exporting jobs always have the memory it needs to finish their job.\n- Improved HDR video export by ensuring it now exports to SDR with the correct colors. When we support end-to-end HDR editing \u0026 exporting, we will re-enable HDR exports.\n- Fix a bug where exporting 4K videos with a frame would crash\n- On iPhone, during export, the interface no longer adjusts to device rotation, which helps reduce memory usage and improves stability and reliability of exports.\n\n### **UI Improvements**\n\n- If the app interface is fully hidden (by tapping on the image to view it full-screen), we now allow you to swipe to dismiss to go back to the library.\n- Fixed some layout issues with the batch toolbar, particularly on iPad.\n- Fixed our in-app announcement message not auto dismiss if you tapped to read the announcement post.\n- Improved the Flag \u0026 Reject bar when swiping to reveal it when also have the edit tools open, now this won’t force the edit tools to collapse, but the Flag \u0026 Reject bar will auto collapse after using them. This way you have a quick way to flag or reject.\n- When picking a photo to add to an album on Mac, double-clicking on a photo will now add it to that album.\n- Fixed side swipe quick start of multi selection showing in the photo picker.\n\nThere are lots of other issues addressed, but we couldn't fit them here ;( So please head over to the website for the full list.","releaseDate":"2021-08-11"},{"versionDisplay":"5.5","releaseNotes":"We've rebuilt the Grain slider from the ground up to reduce memory usage, improve speed and aesthetic as well as make it look closer to film grain.\n\n- The image will now appear to be made up of grain rather than the grain being applied over the top as an overlay. This is particularly evident in bright areas.\n- Adding grain to videos no longer affects the playback frame rate.\n- Fixed a memory related crash when exporting large images with grain.\n- Fixed grain in the Photos extension being too big.\n- Eliminated artifacts and repetitive patterns within the grain.\n- Improved grain for video by making it smaller.\n\n### Crop \u0026 Transform\n\n- Fixed unresponsive perspective transform sliders on iPad when using a trackpad.\n- Fixed the crop center handle from disappearing when zooming in.\n- Improved crop using aspect ratio crop by now always fitting width/height from the center.\n- Fixed the transform on a depth map preview of a portrait depth photo not being applied.\n- Fixed crop history entries being overwritten when reverting a photo and selecting old edits.\n- Fixed unnecessary history entries created when entering the crop tool showing.\n- Fixed the wrong crop cursor size showing for some corners on macOS.\n\n### Memory\n\n- Fixed a memory issue that caused tools to use more memory than needed.\n- Fixed a memory related crash which could occur when exporting portrait photos.\n- Fixed a memory related crash which could occur when exporting multiple videos.\n- Fixed a memory related crash which could occur when exporting RAW photos.\n- Fixed a memory related crash which could occur merging albums.\n- Improved the image cache for portrait photos.\n\n### Bonus\n\n- Improved the loading indicators when viewing a photo to now make an explicit difference between loading data locally from storage, and downloading data from iCloud.\n- Improved the interaction with the home indicator when the tools are open while editing.\n- Improved export by ensuring a saved copy is always added to the same album as the original.\n- Added a prompt to replace edits if existing local edits are different from remote edits.\n- Fixed an issue that could cause filter thumbnails not to load.\n- Fixed an issue which could show an incorrect rejected count.\n- Fixed an issue where the app would get stuck in Limited Photo Library Access state on macOS.\n- Fixed some the Limited Photo Library Access controls overlapping with the home button.\n- Fixed the frame background color not animating when switching colors.\n- Improved the toolbar Flag \u0026 Reject arrow and Transform tap target being too close.\n- Improved the feedback option to contact us to work more reliably.","releaseDate":"2021-07-13"},{"versionDisplay":"5.4.2","releaseNotes":"New in this release:\n- Fixed an issue causing an app to freeze when applying a Filter to a Video or opening certain Portrait Photos","releaseDate":"2021-07-02"},{"versionDisplay":"5.4.1","releaseNotes":"New in this release:\n- Fixed an issue causing a crash or being stuck when exporting a photo with Grain added","releaseDate":"2021-06-29"},{"versionDisplay":"5.4","releaseNotes":"New: Expanded Editing \u0026 Management Siri Shortcuts\n\nOur new Edit With Darkroom Shortcut allows you to use our editing and exporting capabilities right within a Shortcut workflow.

Now, you can just horizontally swipe on any image to start selecting.\nThe visual design also gets a refresh, keeping it in line with the iPad \u0026 Mac, and because we had to fit two new actions, we decided to make the Actions bar scrollable, so everything can breath a little.\n\n# Finding your Flags and Rejects in Other Apps\nWhen you use our Flagging and Rejecting features for the first time, Darkroom will create a new \"Darkroom\" Folder in your system photo library, and inside it create 3 new albums: Exported, Rejected, and Flagged.\nAs you perform Review actions inside Darkroom, these actions are reflected automatically in those Albums, allowing you to find recently flagged photos anywhere on your phone.\nIf you have iCloud Photo Library, these albums will be synced to all your devices, so Review actions are automatically synced to all your devices!\nBecause Rejected photos are typically your least favorite photos, we've also made it easy to quickly delete them all, either at the end of you editing session, or in the Album picker.\n\n# Making Hyper-Fast Review Possible\nYou'll notice a lot of speed and responsiveness improvements in this app. This  is due to a big infrastructure undertaking that dramatically reduced the amount of data downloaded, memory created, and spinners shown when you navigate through your photo library in the editing interface.\nStarting with today's update, if the editing tools are not visible, we skip the heavy work of downloading and initializing the full-quality image, and instead show you a Smart Preview of the photo. This allows you to navigate through your photo library in Darkroom at the same speed as the native Photos app. In fact, the editing interface much more responsive in general.","releaseDate":"2021-03-29"},{"versionDisplay":"5.1.5","releaseNotes":"This update fixes the following issues:\n- Fixed a crash when Photo Library is not available on Mac\n- Fixed sharing to Instagram using native share sheet and Instagram share extension\n- Fixed Crop Tool controls and their responsiveness.\n- Fixed a typo in the Export Sheet.\n- Made sure Histogram is shown when swiping to open the workspace.","releaseDate":"2021-02-12"},{"versionDisplay":"5.1.2","releaseNotes":"# This update fixes the following issues:\n\n- Fixes a crash-on-launch affecting devices using iOS 12\n- Fixes a layout bug causing the photo grid to break its layout in some cases\n- Fixes a bug causing edit retrieval to fail for some kinds of edits\n- Fixes a crash that occurred when dismissing a photo or video in some cases\n- By default, the Photo Strip is now centered, rather than being scrolled to the bottom.","releaseDate":"2020-12-20"},{"versionDisplay":"5.1.1","releaseNotes":"This update adds support for ProRAW photos on iOS 14.3.

Today's update is all about adopting the latest and greatest in macOS Monterey, to ensure Darkroom takes full advantage of its new home. \n\n# Shortcut support on Monterey\n\nWe're excited to roll out full support for Shortcuts on macOS. This is particularly exciting for us because of all the ways that shortcuts are integrated into Monterey. You can now edit your photos right from Finder, from the menu bar, or from context menus. The full power of Darkroom's editing engine is exposed, including cropping, filters, frames, and more. This works for photos anywhere on your file system, not only those in iCloud Photo Library!\n\n# RAW Smart Album on Monterey \u0026 iOS 15\n\nThis has been one of our most requested features. Our library sidebar and album selector now lists a RAW Smart Album that conveniently collects all of your RAW and RAW+JPEG photos in one place.\n\n# Clarity is available on Monterey\n\nFinally! Clarity arrives to the Mac with Monterey! Clarity was on iPhones and iPads exclusively due to technical constraints, but we're thrilled to see it on macOS. This provides editing parity across all the platforms we support!\n\n# Keyboard Navigation\n\nFor many people on the Mac and iPad, using our keyboard shortcuts allows them to quickly navigate through Darkroom. With Monterey Apple made available more tools for us to deepen Darkrooms support for keyboard navigation.\n\nPlease read our announcement on our blog for a full list of new keyboard commands and changes.\n\n# Zoom Improvement\n\nOn Monterey, you'll notice a new slider to handle zooming in and out in the toolbar. This part of a larger effort to continuously refine and improve all the important little details that make your editing experience shine and keep you in the flow. Zooming in Darkroom is now a much more fluid and efficient experience.\n\n# Under the Hood improvements\n\nLots of effort was spent in this update cycle on cleaning up parts of the codebase that have not been touched in a long time. This will result in lots of small bugs being fixed, small performance improvements everywhere that will result in a smoother editing experience, and a lot of little refinements that help us stay at the top of the iOS, iPadOS, and macOS photo editing game.\n\nThank you to all our subscribers who help support our ability to not just cram new features into every release, but also take the time to improve what already exists.","releaseDate":"2021-10-25"},{"versionDisplay":"5.6.2","releaseNotes":"- Fixed Portrait Photo showing rendering glitches.\n- Fixed an issue causing the crash while exporting with Copy Hashtags option included.","releaseDate":"2021-10-07"},{"versionDisplay":"5.6.1","releaseNotes":"This one is a bit smaller than our normal releases, but that's just because we're so busy working on some really exciting changes coming soon. Mainly house-keeping stuff in this update to make sure it works well on iPhone 13 devices and iOS 15. Stay tuned!\n\n- Fix navigation bar appearance on iPhone 13 devices.\n- Improve performance of panning around image while zoomed in.\n- Show accurate time estimates when exporting videos.\n- Fix our top two crashes.\n- Fix performance regression affecting editing responsiveness.\n- Disable HEIF exports on devices running iOS 14.4 up until iOS 15.0 which contained a bug causing diagonal lines to appear when exporting.

Lots and lots of bug fixes here!\n\n### Image Loading\n\n- We rebuilt our image loading and generation infrastructure to provide faster image delivery, more accurate results, and improve reliability.\n- When editing a photo, we now pause library work that might interrupt your interaction with the sliders.\n- All image views in the app now share the same image provider, ensuring they’re all up to date, share resources, and are fast/reliable.\n- Fixes issues where images got stuck loading forever.\n- Fixes issues that caused thumbnails to be blurry in the grid after editing.\n- Fixes rendering glitches when backgrounding the app quickly while editing.\n- Fixes a bug where cropped and/or framed images would stretch if you open the Crop Tool.\n- We use a lot less memory in our caching layer, ensuring sliders stay responsive and stable.\n\n### RAW + JPG Photos\n\n- Added a new setting to define what version you want to load by default. This allows us to skip asking you every time if you want to change the default when switching.\n- Fixed an issue that could cause the RAW photos to appear too small, and JPEGs to show visual glitches when switching between the two.\n- Fixed an issue that could cause RAW photos to display their dark regions too brightly.\n\n### Crop \u0026 Transform\n\n- Improved crop aspect ratio option by making the selection of the “As Shot” and “Free” options sticky across edit sessions.\n- Fixed an issue that caused crop corner controls to not properly settle on the edges if moving quickly past an edge.\n- Fixed an issue that caused crop controls to not respond if your drag gesture was slow to start moving.\n- Fixed a rare issue that could cause the crop controls to disappear!\n- Fixed a lot of alignment and visual layout issues with the Transform tool.\n- When cropping, we now disable the gesture to dismiss the tools, which could get in your way of cropping.\n\n### Photos App Extension\n\n- Improved memory use in our Photos Extension, making it more stable\n- The Clarity slider is still using too much memory and causing the photo extension to crash, so we decided to removed it from the Photos Extension until we can address its memory use.\n\n### Exporting\n\n- When you are exporting, we now pause all other image processing to speed up the export, and provide it as much memory as possible.\n- We now re-use a lot more memory between editing and export, reducing the memory load of the app, and ensuring exporting jobs always have the memory it needs to finish their job.\n- Improved HDR video export by ensuring it now exports to SDR with the correct colors. When we support end-to-end HDR editing \u0026 exporting, we will re-enable HDR exports.\n- Fix a bug where exporting 4K videos with a frame would crash\n- On iPhone, during export, the interface no longer adjusts to device rotation, which helps reduce memory usage and improves stability and reliability of exports.\n\n### **UI Improvements**\n\n- If the app interface is fully hidden (by tapping on the image to view it full-screen), we now allow you to swipe to dismiss to go back to the library.\n- Fixed some layout issues with the batch toolbar, particularly on iPad.\n- Fixed our in-app announcement message not auto dismiss if you tapped to read the announcement post.\n- Improved the Flag \u0026 Reject bar when swiping to reveal it when also have the edit tools open, now this won’t force the edit tools to collapse, but the Flag \u0026 Reject bar will auto collapse after using them. This way you have a quick way to flag or reject.\n- When picking a photo to add to an album on Mac, double-clicking on a photo will now add it to that album.\n- Fixed side swipe quick start of multi selection showing in the photo picker.\n\nThere are lots of other issues addressed, but we couldn't fit them here ;( So please head over to the website for the full list.","releaseDate":"2021-08-11"},{"versionDisplay":"5.5","releaseNotes":"We've rebuilt the Grain slider from the ground up to reduce memory usage, improve speed and aesthetic as well as make it look closer to film grain.\n\n- The image will now appear to be made up of grain rather than the grain being applied over the top as an overlay.

This gives you the ability to either make fine adjustments for portraits, or go beyond for dramatic landscapes using one single \u0026 smart tool.\n\nAlongside the new Clarity slider, this update also includes other bug fixes and further performance improvements:\n\n- Improved (Pro)RAW highlights and shadows detail recovery, especially when HDR data is present.\n- Improved overall portrait depth editing handling:\n    - Improved blur and depth editing performance greatly.\n    - Adjusting the depth mask now also previews the blur adjustments in realtime.\n    - Fixed render glitches that could sometimes occur on portrait photos.\n    - Fixed a potential memory related crash when exporting portrait photos.\n- Improved memory usage during export.\n- Improved handling for 16-bit TIFF exports.\n- Fixed an issue where we could load the wrong size RAW if it had a cropped JPG attached.\n- Fixed a crash that could happen when adding a photo to an album when editing a photo.\n- Fixed a crash that could happen when renaming an album.\n- Fixed some strings in the Export dialog not being properly translated.\n- Fixed active edits in Crop/Transform tool not being exported when in the tool.\n- Fixed on iPad/Mac ESC keyboard shortcut dismissing photo when in the transform tool.\n- Fixed batch actions showing for Shared Albums where the can’t be used.\n- Added Mac Sidebar width restoring when opening a window.\n- Added on iPad a new default for Photostrip to always open when viewing a photo.\n- Added 3 new and fun Darkroom+  App Icon variants: Panda, 80's, and Swirl.","releaseDate":"2021-05-13"},{"versionDisplay":"5.2.3","releaseNotes":"- We're re-introducing the Screenshot filter as a Setting!

Getting to the right photo and knowing which one to edit however, can feel like work.\nToday we're taking a big step forward to making all this fun \u0026 super fast with a new workflow to cull and review your photos: Flag your highlights, and Reject the bad ones.\nWhen you make one of those choices, we'll automatically advance you to the next photo so you can get in a ~flow state~ and zoom through your latest batch of imports in no time.\n\n# How to use the new Review Features\nOn the iPhone, swipe right on the editing toolbar, and you can start flagging and rejecting. As you tap, Darkroom will automatically advance you to the next photo.\nOn the iPad \u0026 Mac, you'll see new icons to Flag and Reject alongside the existing Favorite and Delete options. Keyboard shortcuts will help you also quickly categorize a photo and move to the next one.\n\n# Batch processing gets a lot of love too\nBatch actions are becoming more powerful and more useful, so we \nadded a new gesture to let you start selecting photos much more efficiently. Now, you can just horizontally swipe on any image to start selecting.\nThe visual design also gets a refresh, keeping it in line with the iPad \u0026 Mac, and because we had to fit two new actions, we decided to make the Actions bar scrollable, so everything can breath a little.\n\n# Finding your Flags and Rejects in Other Apps\nWhen you use our Flagging and Rejecting features for the first time, Darkroom will create a new \"Darkroom\" Folder in your system photo library, and inside it create 3 new albums: Exported, Rejected, and Flagged.\nAs you perform Review actions inside Darkroom, these actions are reflected automatically in those Albums, allowing you to find recently flagged photos anywhere on your phone.\nIf you have iCloud Photo Library, these albums will be synced to all your devices, so Review actions are automatically synced to all your devices!\nBecause Rejected photos are typically your least favorite photos, we've also made it easy to quickly delete them all, either at the end of you editing session, or in the Album picker.\n\n# Making Hyper-Fast Review Possible\nYou'll notice a lot of speed and responsiveness improvements in this app. This  is due to a big infrastructure undertaking that dramatically reduced the amount of data downloaded, memory created, and spinners shown when you navigate through your photo library in the editing interface.\nStarting with today's update, if the editing tools are not visible, we skip the heavy work of downloading and initializing the full-quality image, and instead show you a Smart Preview of the photo. This allows you to navigate through your photo library in Darkroom at the same speed as the native Photos app. In fact, the editing interface much more responsive in general.","releaseDate":"2021-03-29"},{"versionDisplay":"5.1.5","releaseNotes":"This update fixes the following issues:\n- Fixed a crash when Photo Library is not available on Mac\n- Fixed sharing to Instagram using native share sheet and Instagram share extension\n- Fixed Crop Tool controls and their responsiveness.\n- Fixed a typo in the Export Sheet.\n- Made sure Histogram is shown when swiping to open the workspace.","releaseDate":"2021-02-12"},{"versionDisplay":"5.1.3","releaseNotes":"# This update fixes the following issues:\n\n- Fixes a crash-on-launch affecting devices using iOS 12\n- Fixes a layout bug causing the photo grid to break its layout in some cases\n- Fixes a bug causing edit retrieval to fail for some kinds of edits\n- Fixes a crash that occurred when dismissing a photo or video in some cases\n- By default, the Photo Strip is now centered, rather than being scrolled to the bottom.","releaseDate":"2020-12-20"},{"versionDisplay":"5.1.1","releaseNotes":"This update adds support for ProRAW photos on iOS 14.3.
