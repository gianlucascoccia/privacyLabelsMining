        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This update has a few more iOS 13 goodies plus some fixes!<br /><br />NEW: If you’re on iOS or iPadOS 13, there are new context menus in Locations View and Week View. Tap and hold on a location or a day for a detailed preview of the forecast. (This is similar to the 3D Touch peek &amp; pop previews in iOS 12 and lower, but they also work on iPad now too. If you have a 3D Touch device on iOS 12 or lower, you can still peek &amp; pop.)<br /><br />FIX: Some things (like the current location icon in Siri Shortcuts) weren’t set to the correct color when the app is set to follow the iOS 13 system dark mode appearance, but now they are.<br /><br />FIX: On iPadOS 13, the widget no longer shows too many squished cells.<br /><br />FIX: The current pressure indicator (the trend arrow looking three hours ahead) in Today View is back, and it will now appear in Siri Shortcuts too when the current pressure is shown.<br /><br />NEW: iOS 13’s new inset grouped table view style is now used throughout settings and settings submenus as well as in the views to edit the locations list and locations.<br /><br />—————<br /><br />As always, thank you for using Partly Sunny!

    New Favorite Weather App!
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Partly Sunny is now my favorite weather app! The app design is sleek, easy to use and super intuitive. It features loads of customizable options that I can use depending on what my current needs are. Prior to this I was using another weather app almost exclusively, but after stumbling across Partly Sunny, I have changed my mind! One weekend while my family was visiting, we were supposed to do some outdoor sight seeing. The forecast on my previous weather app called for gloom and rain all weekend. Partly Sunny, however, gave a much more optimistic outlook. So we decided to take our chances and go with what PS forecasted. I’m very grateful we did because what PS predicted was far more accurate and we ended up being able to do everything outside that we wanted to do. Since then, I’ve never gone back to the old app. It seems that other apps show a more generalized “safe” prediction while PS isn’t afraid to report a more detailed and precise forecasts. Well worth the switch!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been using Partly Sunny since the beginning and it’s the first weather app that has combined a design I really like with thoughtful UX design and detailed data if I want it. I love the graphs and the happy little icons and being able to use the “feels like” temperature at a glance.<br /><br />I signed up for the yearly subscription so I can see yesterday’s weather and it’s been really helpful when I’m getting dressed in the morning. I’ve also used the time machine feature while packing for the holidays since I couldn’t remember how cold it was last year. Great timing for this update!</p>

    Almost perfect, widget can be tweaked
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I will start by saying that the app itself is beautiful and perfect 5/5. I have literally tried dozens of other weather apps and this one is by far the best. I love all the large in app icons for the weather and the hour by hour graph works very well. I also love how bold the icons look when you swipe up to wee the weekly forecast.<br /><br />However, a bit of criticism, I don&#39;t think that the clean, bold and beautiful icons translate well into the widget. Here are a few suggestions I have.<br /><br />1) While the hour by hour graph looks great in the app, on the widget it takes too much unnecessary room while the widget is expanded and leaves a lot unused wasted space. I feel like it could easily be condensed hight wise about 10-20%. This would allow for point 2.<br /><br />2) The weekly forecast icons are so easily visible and large/bold in the app but on the widget they are squeezed in on the bottom very tightly and are so small that its hard to see them. I feel like if the hourly graph on top was condensed it would allow more room for the weekly forecast icons on the bottom. This way the widgets icons would be proportional to the in app icons and the whole widget would feel just a bit cleaner and in sync with the app. <br /><br />But other than that I love the app, I just think the widget could be tweaked.</p>

update has a few more iOS 13 goodies plus some fixes!\n\nNEW: If you’re on iOS or iPadOS 13, there are new context menus in Locations View and Week View. Tap and hold on a location or a day for a detailed preview of the forecast. (This is similar to the 3D Touch peek \u0026 pop previews in iOS 12 and lower, but they also work on iPad now too. If you have a 3D Touch device on iOS 12 or lower, you can still peek \u0026 pop.)\n\nFIX: Some things (like the current location icon in Siri Shortcuts) weren’t set to the correct color when the app is set to follow the iOS 13 system dark mode appearance, but now they are.\n\nFIX: On iPadOS 13, the widget no longer shows too many squished cells.\n\nFIX: The current pressure indicator (the trend arrow looking three hours ahead) in Today View is back, and it will now appear in Siri Shortcuts too when the current pressure is shown.\n\nNEW: iOS 13’s new inset grouped table view style is now used throughout settings and settings submenus as well as in the views to edit the locations list and locations.\n\n—————\n\nAs always, thank you for using Partly Sunny! If you have a question or suggestion or run into an issue, please email me at support@partlysunnyapp.com!","releaseDate":"2019-11-16"},{"versionDisplay":"1.4.4","releaseNotes":"Partly Sunny now supports iOS 13 system dark mode in the app, widget, and Siri Shortcuts. The widget and Siri Shortcuts will automatically match the system dark mode setting. To have the app match…\n\nIf you’re on iOS 13, in Settings \u003e Dark Mode, there’s a new option to match the app’s dark mode to the system setting. If you don’t want to use the system setting, dark mode can still be customized to use dark gray or black base colors and to toggle on demand, automatically based on screen brightness, or automatically at sunrise and sunset.\n\nThe Settings, Edit List, and Edit Location views use the new iOS 13 draggable modal functionality. Drag down on the views to dismiss them. (You can still do this on iOS 12, but it’s much better now in iOS 13.)\n\nStay tuned for more iOS 13 support!\n\n———\n\nIn case you missed what was new recently in Partly Sunny, here are some highlights:\n\nIn Settings \u003e Temperatures, there’s a new toggle to simultaneously show the current actual and “feels like” temperatures in Locations View and the widget.\n\nFor Partly Sunny Club subscribers, there’s a new popup view to customize the weather map layer and other map settings.\n\nFor locations in the US, there’s a new Radar \u0026 Warnings layer in Map Settings to show severe weather warnings on the map in addition to radar. (Partly Sunny Club required.)\n\nFor locations in the US and Canada, there’s a new Advisories layer in Map Settings to show weather advisories on the map like “heat advisory”, “air quality alert”, and “wind chill advisory”.

Trying to get the weather for “Canada”, for example, just doesn’t work.\n• Fixed some dark-theme background colors that were

The app design is sleek, easy to use and super intuitive. It features loads of customizable options that I can use depending on what my current needs are. Prior to this I was using another weather app almost exclusively, but after stumbling across Partly Sunny, I have changed my mind! One weekend while my family was visiting, we were supposed to do some outdoor sight seeing. The forecast on my previous weather app called for gloom and rain all weekend. Partly Sunny, however, gave a much more optimistic outlook. So we decided to take our chances and go with what PS forecasted. I’m very grateful we did because what PS predicted was far more accurate and we ended up being able to do everything outside that we wanted to do. Since then, I’ve never gone back to the old app. It seems that other apps show a more generalized “safe” prediction while PS isn’t afraid to report a more detailed and precise forecasts.

I have literally tried dozens of other weather apps and this one is by far the best. I love all the large in app icons for the weather and the hour by hour graph works very well. I also love how bold the icons look when you swipe up to wee the weekly forecast.\n\nHowever, a bit of criticism, I don't think that the clean, bold and beautiful icons translate well into the widget. Here are a few suggestions I have.\n\n1) While the hour by hour graph looks great in the app, on the widget it takes too much unnecessary room while the widget is expanded and leaves a lot unused wasted space. I feel like it could easily be condensed hight wise about 10-20%. This would allow for point 2.\n\n2) The weekly forecast icons are so easily visible and large/bold in the app but on the widget they are squeezed in on the bottom very tightly and are so small that its hard to see them. I feel like if the hourly graph on top was condensed it would allow more room for the weekly forecast icons on the bottom. This way the widgets icons would be proportional to the in app icons and the whole widget would feel just a bit cleaner and in sync with the app. \n\nBut other than that I love the app, I just think the widget could be tweaked.","title":"Almost perfect, widget can be tweaked","userName":"Nighthawk."},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3027675956","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-08-06T23:34:54Z","rating":3,"review":"I have had this app for a few months now, and I think it is organized well with a great user interface.

I can understand 2 or 3 degrees difference, but 10?

This was an update with Dark Sky, Partly Sunny’s data provider, that is now supported in the app.\n\nMoon Times\nMoonrise and moonset times can now be displayed in Day View when tapping a day in daily charts. You can toggle them on in Settings.\n\nBetter Location Naming\nAutomatic location naming is greatly improved.

In addition, default location names will now display in the language of your device. Location names not already in the language of your device will automatically be converted. You still can provide a custom name and map position for each location by going to Edit List and tapping the “i” next to each location.\n\nDesign Tweaks\nText is slightly bolder throughout the app and widget.
