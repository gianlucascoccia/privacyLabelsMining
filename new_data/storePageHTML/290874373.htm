AutoTrack is a feature that will automatically track your drives. All you need to do is carry your device with you. Human Scan will allow you to take a picture of a receipt and have an actual human extract the key information and update your expense entry. You do NOT need this add-on if you simply want to take photos of your receipt as the app already has that built-in.\n\nSubscription Details:\n* Payment charged to iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Automatically renews unless cancelled at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n* AutoTrack can be subscribed on monthly or a yearly basis.\n* Human Scan can be subscribed on a monthly basis.\n-----\n\nsilverwaresoftware.com/PrivacyPolicy.html\nsilverwaresoftware.com/TermsOfUse.html","screenshot":["https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/eb/f7/2a/ebf72ab0-b2bf-85e9-e1a1-9464a0f36180/57c9e676-c7ba-4c17-8435-c2a8245cc60a_1_iPhoneXS.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/26/27/c2/2627c25e-7ee4-73f8-c122-aceded370bd7/826b58e8-bd3b-4bca-86aa-4baf0183795e_2_iPhoneXS.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/2f/ce/56/2fce56c6-e1d4-1821-bb36-b5940e693114/ed2f89b7-0d12-44f4-babd-2688e0a7afc9_3_IPHONEXS.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/61/24/b5/6124b537-454e-9959-27b6-6d39d4edeac8/deee91f1-4097-4461-9c03-96ba885c7b83_1_iPad2.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/00/b9/f3/00b9f35e-cf7b-48e5-df04-2dbac9de62d8/45494d7f-7445-424c-8646-e838279435f6_2_iPad2.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/5e/ed/55/5eed555c-19f4-15ec-7987-d6369dda7f29/06017910-6daa-49c6-910a-64b291dce09b_3_iPad2.png/643x0w.jpg"],"image":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/03/4a/a6/034aa6d6-5951-312a-debd-680ede1a6c13/AppIconXT-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-10-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/1200x630wa.png","applicationCategory":"Finance","datePublished":"Feb 11, 2019","operatingSystem":"Requires iOS 11.0 or later.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>April 2019 - I have been using this app since 2013 when I had just started a business.  I use it to record both personal and business expenses, and truly rely on it.  It’s intuitive, clear, and provides whatever I need.  I get the sense that, if I were to become a more savvy user, this app would be able to do whatever I might want it to do.  It’s very customizable.  And what I love about that is that I don’t have to figure out all the bells and whistles - I just have to know how to use the ones I WANT to use.  And it doesn’t feel difficult or complicated.  Love it.  <br /><br />And I have to applaud the support - the few times I’ve had a question or issue (usually user error:)), I’ve written them a note and the app author himself has responded.  Scott is always helpful and clear about how to do what I’m trying to do (creating a specific report, etc.).  I don’t feel like I’m left to struggle on my own.  Knowing they are there to answer questions (and cheerfully!) makes me so happy to use this app.  Thank you, and please keep up the great work!!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I wanted an app to do budgeting, expense recoding, and budget tracking with my iPhone, including cash expenditures, since I can quickly enter even on the go. The standard budgeting apps want you to create an account and connect to your bank, at least at the time that I bought this app which was several years back. Since I didn’t want to do that, I looked for other options and found this app. It really wasn’t created for for budgeting, but rather for travel expense tracking, so I’m not quibbling over some minor shortcomings. It has capabilities to create new categories and that’s how I got it to work for my purposes. I especially like the ability to create a CSV file at the end of the year. This app has been worth the money. I don’t claim that I was exhaustive in my app searching, just that this app worked for what I wanted. It’s great that you can buy it as a one time purchase (at least when I did). Definitely recommend.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>July 2017:   This makes my expense and Mileage tracking SO SO efficient!   My business taxes this year were So much simpler and faster with all of the categories plainly and easily added up and given to my CPA.   The amount of customization that you can do in the tracking logs seems infinite-- I am sure I don&#39;t even use half of what this app is capable of doing.  The support team seems always willing to<br />Help and has written a custom formula for me to track a specific item.   <br />My teenagers easily navigate this app to record my business mileage and expenses and even ask to help bc they like to use the app!!   Love it! <br /><br />   As a self-employed Direct Sales Mom - this App is the BEST!!!   An update has let me consolidate my business mileage and expenses into monthly reports and a recent appeal to the Developers for an edit or hint to print my reports exactly as my CPA needs -- was answered an solved within 24 hours!!!!   Grab this App!!!</p>

It has capabilities to create new categories and that’s how I got it to work for my purposes. I especially like the ability to create a CSV file at the end of the year.
