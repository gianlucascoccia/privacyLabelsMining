Fight with Daryl Dixon!\n\nMake friends or fight with other survivors. Do whatever you must to survive. It won’t be easy. The infected are everywhere. Resources are scarce and you must salvage what you can from the carcass of society.\n\n\nIt’s a new world out there. Dangerous, yes, but filled with opportunity. Immense power awaits those bold enough to grasp it. But remember to watch your back. It’s fair to say people aren’t quite as friendly as they used they be…\n\n\nRebuild\n\nBuild up your Settlement to form a safe haven for your survivors and a foundation for your post-apocalyptic empire.\n\n\nRescue\n\nSave survivors to swell your numbers and increase your strength. Locate those with special abilities, they will be the heroes of the plague war!\n\n\nResearch\n\nThe zombie disease is mutating rapidly. Learn whatever you can to understand it. Whoever can control the infection controls the state!\n\n\nSocialize\n\nThere is strength in numbers. Make allies and forge strategic partnerships to survive the horrors of the infected Wilderness. Join forces to pulverize any who try to take advantage of you.\n\n\nRip up the Rulebook\n\nIt’s humanity 2.0. Rewrite the rules on how you want humankind to progress.","screenshot":["https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d4/79/c8/d479c8a0-a82f-5d41-553a-e7c7ef5e0aed/d6d508d9-cd1f-4610-aee5-5cf3ab3f3f8b_2732x2048-1.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/19/b3/90/19b39051-bd8f-8249-fcc4-a8d1d61dd092/faa8b484-8a2a-4152-b72e-23507c8a3d1b_2732x2048-2.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/9c/b6/99/9cb69978-28e7-a8e5-aa15-e5e3ca42b325/19d587e5-3846-48da-814f-866c8f8c3ae0_2732x2048-3.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/d6/a1/7d/d6a17db2-a9b2-692b-bcd0-fc0a7abde33d/c9615a82-7efe-4d40-ab15-9aebf30d4076_2732x2048-4.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/f9/f6/60/f9f660d8-c85c-1690-4ba8-bc5e95b73ef8/b8b416e2-5aa1-42c9-85a6-190781ced048_2732x2048-5.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/af/76/6e/af766e83-e3f8-238b-27cf-90638de18eec/383c9f04-3926-4d20-9b1e-a47427631e60_2732x2048-6.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/fb/13/46/fb134628-edc2-1dc2-8f5a-c5d80c0cb0c3/014b2253-7527-4110-aacb-b62f354f9532_2688x1242-1.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/1e/1a/38/1e1a38a3-2174-b8c1-b348-2e208c79ff72/1480b08e-ed80-4e0d-9195-49080e703c7a_2688x1242-2.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/94/42/55/9442551f-7e4c-e4e7-e095-7bf4a255c425/eced6401-9dba-4a16-9f6f-24851832ad07_2688x1242-3.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource116/v4/72/a1/8f/72a18ff3-6a96-0fe9-f6fa-7059b98873f0/4d1e8550-70e3-48cb-bce4-3a2ac00b0f5c_2688x1242-4.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/83/e2/2f/83e22f60-7639-a59f-8f1a-3b380211edd2/f2913ac7-a799-4919-8e56-129c12358c7d_2688x1242-5.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/a7/f6/b0/a7f6b0ec-c8ef-7bae-de74-261f0435e232/c3180966-b6e2-48ef-b0a2-16556d0519bc_2688x1242-6.jpg/643x0w.jpg"],"image":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/af/ef/12/afef1200-9c3f-4935-83bb-13b28c0ece07/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/1200x630wa.png","applicationCategory":"Games","datePublished":"Aug 29, 2019","operatingSystem":"Requires iOS 11.0 or later.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve played a couple of games like this one. Upgrade, train, defeat, support your alliance by trading and lowering their time to upgrade, attack other alliances. One in particular I played was difficult to follow at first. They gave a quick tutorial and set you free then never helped you understand how certain upgrade points applied to other parts of the game in order to increase defense and overall strength and knights. You needed communication with your alliance to get help. If you also did not buy enough packages ($5-100), you were going to lose to other alliances who were constantly attacking. This one however encourages you to grow your food and defeat zombies to get better. The packages are $4.99 which makes it easier. Also, when you don’t have enough resources to build or defeat, the game shows you how to get them with a cursor showing you what to tap to help you out. It completely guides you even when you’ve been playing for a while. Still very helpful. <br />There’s a lot of hidden areas to tap to grab the resources you’ve worked for. There’s events to work towards too. There’s also skins for your headquarters which gives you abilities and looks fun, theres options to change your hero, you can change your profile photo to your own or a character’s, you can also arrange your base and make it look however you want.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I went in to SoS with indifferent and honestly low expectations. The ads I’ve seen don’t do it justice though I know it’s a hard genre to advertise. I really like the multiple things you can do instead of just managing your settlement. I think the little exploration tasks and survival challenges really add flavor to it and are pretty fun. The in game transactions are honestly fair priced and you still get a lot of biocaps for completing missions so unless you have something specific in mind you might not even need to buy to progress. I like the multiple chiefs and their different combat abilities too. I think the events are pretty neat. The dailys are really beneficial too. If I had any criticism it’d be that it might be nice to have troops linger in the battlefield instead of completely returning. It can be a little cumbersome to have two intel missions right next to each other, 80km out, and have to wait 3 minutes for them to come back to send them out again. Though it’s entirely possible I’ve missed something. All in all, I’m having fun with it. Being in an alliance actually feels helpful for timers and such when in other games I’ve barely noticed their assistance. For reference for where I’m at in the game — I’m upgrading my HQ to 18 and I’ve been playing religiously for a week.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Okay so the game is basically pretty cool but it has some draw backs first of all u less you spend money it’s hard to collect all the players cause you have to collect pieces of them and if you get them you rarely get them again to level up but you’ll get the same 2 characters till there generals and the dam game goes into over drive and when you do the searches like your supposed to now all of a sudden the game wants to give you 5 of that character now and you cannot even use them any more why not rotate the players you do need why does it give you the same 2 people and you can’t use those pieces anymore. Also when your in a clan you cannot share your resources with you guild mates on all other games you can share supplies within your guild and they tax you for it which is very helpful cause if your attacked and all of your supplies are taken and they have killed all your troops it will take you a week just to get back to what you had because it takes for ever to collect the resources back to get your troops back if you could share withi. Your guild you could put a tax on the resources that you share so like if you shared a million food or wood the tax could be high to begin with but if you leveled up say a trading station your taxes of resoreces could be reduced but never less than say 10% I just wish it would be more team friendly that away. Other then that it’s an okay game</p>

The Final Hope has named the campaign the \"Comeback\" and the airship launch day the \"Day of Hope.\" The Day of Hope celebration will be divided into four stages. During this nearly month-long celebration, you will experience 20 immersive and rewarding events such as Airship Designs, Day of Hope: Celebration Redecoration, Yearbook, Day of Hope Giveaway, and more.

Upgrade, train, defeat, support your alliance by trading and lowering their time to upgrade, attack other alliances. One in particular I played was difficult to follow at first. They gave a quick tutorial and set you free then never helped you understand how certain upgrade points applied to other parts of the game in order to increase defense and overall strength and knights. You needed communication with your alliance to get help. If you also did not buy enough packages ($5-100), you were going to lose to other alliances who were constantly attacking. This one however encourages you to grow your food and defeat zombies to get better. The packages are $4.99 which makes it easier. Also, when you don’t have enough resources to build or defeat, the game shows you how to get them with a cursor showing you what to tap to help you out. It completely guides you even when you’ve been playing for a while. Still very helpful. \nThere’s a lot of hidden areas to tap to grab the resources you’ve worked for. There’s events to work towards too. There’s also skins for your headquarters which gives you abilities and looks fun, theres options to change your hero, you can change your profile photo to your own or a character’s, you can also arrange your base and make it look however you want.","title":"Easy to follow, low priced packages","userName":"Yesdnyl99"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7845495255","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-09-26T00:39:37Z","rating":5,"review":"I went in to SoS with indifferent and honestly low expectations. The ads I’ve seen don’t do it justice though I know it’s a hard genre to advertise. I really like the multiple things you can do instead of just managing your settlement. I think the little exploration tasks and survival challenges really add flavor to it and are pretty fun. The in game transactions are honestly fair priced and you still get a lot of biocaps for completing missions so unless you have something specific in mind you might not even need to buy to progress. I like the multiple chiefs and their different combat abilities too. I think the events are pretty neat. The dailys are really beneficial too. If I had any criticism it’d be that it might be nice to have troops linger in the battlefield instead of completely returning. It can be a little cumbersome to have two intel missions right next to each other, 80km out, and have to wait 3 minutes for them to come back to send them out again. Though it’s entirely possible I’ve missed something. All in all, I’m having fun with it. Being in an alliance actually feels helpful for timers and such when in other games I’ve barely noticed their assistance. For reference for where I’m at in the game — I’m upgrading my HQ to 18 and I’ve been playing religiously for a week.","title":"Fair and unique","userName":"birbitto"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6448374158","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-20T08:33:19Z","developerResponse":{"id":18006247,"body":"Thank you for taking the time to write to us.

Also when your in a clan you cannot share your resources with you guild mates on all other games you can share supplies within your guild and they tax you for it which is very helpful cause if your attacked and all of your supplies are taken and they have killed all your troops it will take you a week just to get back to what you had because it takes for ever to collect the resources back to get your troops back if you could share withi. Your guild you could put a tax on the resources that you share so like if you shared a million food or wood the tax could be high to begin with but if you leveled up say a trading station your taxes of resoreces could be reduced but never less than say 10% I just wish it would be more team friendly that away.

Build a settlement, attack zombies and compete with others for rewards. Warning, it is an expensive game. I’m fine with that, my issue is that their support is horrible. If you have any issue, it’s your fault. The game is riddled with bugs that lead to missing rewards (both free, and ones YOU PAID FOR), also some of the benefits (called buffs) you purchase won’t always work. Again, if you contact support, they will immediately say it’s your fault and close the support ticket. I found too many bugs that took things away from me that I paid for, so I stopped putting any money in. I also reported a few mystery charges I did not initiate, again it’s your fault, not theirs. I suggest you play it for free, and resist the urge to spend, because the developers will just find a way to steal from you. Or better yet, just move on to try one of the many other games that are exactly like this. Maybe those developers treat their customers better.\n\n*** Response to developer: More time? Each time I submitted an issue you were quick to close the ticket without asking any follow up questions. I had to submit the same ticket three times for the same bug. Each time having to re-explain the issue to every new agent who responded. You were not interested in fixing the issue, you just wanted to blow off your customer who spent A LOT of money. So, I’m done spending money. I’ll play for free with that kind of support. ***","title":"Horrible Support","userName":"jpack"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6176624452","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-09T13:05:33Z","developerResponse":{"id":16538536,"body":"Greetings Survivor, \r\nThank you for the kind words.

There hasn’t been a game I’ve actually enjoyed this much until this game. BUT, I have recently hit a brick wall, I’m a clan leader but the alliance has hit a brick wall with the alliance towers and research because there are no Gas Alliance Nodes along the outskirts meaning you have to move closer towards the middle to get Gas alliance nodes, unfortunately it also makes it harder to move because clans already Staken claim to areas within the map making it harder for smaller clans to grow and build along side of them. Honestly there should be more Gas alliance nodes all over the map especially on the outskirts of the map so it’s fair for all alliances. Also there should also be a  way to @ people in chat whether it’s one person or the clan as a whole. Lastly I feel like clan leaders should have more reign during alliance events for example Alliance Showdown, give the clan leader the chance to move people to different lanes.\n\nHonestly, I want to give this game 5 stars hands down, but there are just things that limit growth in the game whether it’s individual or as a clan. But I still love the game I just wish things could be added to the game ie; Gas Alliance Nodes around the outskirts, since there are already farm, wood, and metal Nodes. It forces smaller clans to have to move where there is no space cause stronger clans already taken up space in the central parts of the map.","title":"Love it!

I did go ahead and purchase the Extra Labor Pack, my card got charged but I did not get the pack.. i had to “update” my payment so it directed me to the App Store and I put okay and the payment went through then when I went back the the game it said “payment failed”. So I was like okay whatever, I was pretty hesitant to buy it in the first place so I didn’t mind that it didn’t go through, he next day I check my purchase history in the App Store and I had a payment pending for The State Of Survival.... I go and check my bank app AND of course the payment is pending. So I tried disputing it with apple first and all they said was to contact the game support. So I went to see if I can find a number or something AND nothing. So I have to now dispute it with my bank and it is very annoying that the payment went through but I didn’t get the pack... which I really want because it has that extra slot to build two things at once, which would be fantastic. Now I’m just going to wait for my money to get back into my account and hopefully the pack is still there so I can purchase the thing and actually get what I’m paying for lol. \n\nSmall rant but good game just be cautious if you’re purchasing anything in the app.","title":".","userName":"Egg Cuteness ^.^"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6437481204","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-17T07:16:56Z","developerResponse":{"id":17958295,"body":"Greetings Survivor,\r\nSorry to hear that you feel that way about the game.

The graphics are good and there’s plenty of content to do for being a free game. That being said, the developers make it clear they want you to spend money by constantly putting different ‘packs’ everywhere on your screen that can be purchased. One example is that every time you load the game there’s a pack that is offered for 4.99 (right now it’s the Survival of the Fittest pack). You can also pay to have a second construction slot to upgrade buildings, which is reasonable for the price. What isn’t reasonable is that every time you create a new character, you have to purchase the second construction slot again. This was very misleading because I purchased it on my first character thinking it was a one-time only purchase because it literally says that in the game! The game can be played without ever having to pay money, but just know that you won’t ever be as powerful as the people who pay for power(yes this game is pay-to-win). I’ve been playing this game for over 10 months now and I do enjoy it, although sometimes I do get annoyed at how much the game tries to advertise different things that can be purchased. If you are looking for a new game to play that is free I would recommend trying out SoS, but just note that it’s pay-to-win and you’re going to get bombarded with ‘deals’ and offers in the game.","title":"Average free game with good graphics","userName":"deano19892012"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6789590788","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-12-24T20:59:49Z","developerResponse":{"id":18458013,"body":"Greetings Survivor,\r\nSorry to hear that you feel that way about the game.

But as is the norm for this type of game it’s fun for a few days then you need to shell out $$$ to get things done without waiting hours for upgrades on buildings or troops to finish. This game has good game play and lots of missions to keep you busy but once again it’s a game where the biggest players destroy the smaller players constantly so what’s the sense of playing. I don’t mind being attacked and losing a battle and resources but there no way to continue to grow when you are attacked and destroyed several times a day. Put a limit on how much a player can lose before a free and I mean free shield pops up to save loss of resources based on player level. I liked this game and even in an alliance you get destroyed. It’s a shame I don’t mind spending here and there to play but the cost of a shield is way too expensive. Just another good game that’s going to lose out on the volume of player to please the few big spenders. Such a shame this was a well designed game. It’s almost a great game. But who wants to grind and have nothing to show for it when your not on and have to start over. If you lose a battle pvp you might as well quit moving your base and a shield (peace flare) will break you wallet. I understand the game needs to make money but 100 small spenders will spend more than 1 big spender food for thought.","title":"Good game  with the same old story","userName":"Jozzut"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6233118934","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-23T17:47:02Z","rating":5,"review":"I have been playing a week or so; it is a fun addictive game with tons to do. Pokes to spend real money on the game are pretty reasonably not in your face but easily found if you want to go that route. I did spend about $15 on a top-up special and it gave me a big start as far as being able to speed up training and upgrading of my buildings. Worth it to me. Heck, I’d easily spend that on lunch and now that we’re in the COVID-19 era, I’m not going out to lunch as often as I used to so might as well still have some fun! I joined an alliance that is casual but active, which is nice! I love the events and the way that missions and other tasks are kinda staggered so you can play for pretty long periods of time. I wish that I could queue up research when individual research tasks are less than 10 minutes, maybe up to a limit of three tasks. Not a fan of shooty stuff where I have to control individual heroes so I’m really glad I can set the shooty challenges on auto and 3x speed...it is amusing to watch the zombies shamble into bullets and die in that mode.

The first few levels are great but as you advance upgrades to your buildings take longer and longer until upgrades take hours to complete. To make matters worse you hit a wall on what you can do without upgrading. You cannot queue up your upgrades so the next one starts when the one you are working on finishes. That would be a great feature to help with advancing gameplay while you are off doing real life things like working, going to school or sleeping. You cannot add a second construction slot to work on other things unless you pay real money.  The same goes for training troops. At higher levels it takes hours. Upgrading your hero hits a wall. The really good upgrades, you guessed it, costs real money. Exploring the world? You can send out tow groups to gather resources, which once again, takes hours on higher levels. You cannot get more groups to send out unless, you guessed it again, pay real money. Researching new technologies. You hit the upgrade wall and you can’t research more than one thing at a time unless, you guessed it, pay real money. Do you see a pattern emerging? After a certain point this becomes a wait forever for something to happen or pay to play. I am almost a week into it and have already hit the pay to play wall.

changes.","title":"Addictive","userName":"michaelspringfield"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1462622416","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"A special offer just for
