        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Like another reviewer, I downloaded the app to watch Yellowstone.  Awesome show.  The app needs some work though.  They’ve fixed the show order sequence.  I didn’t have a problem there but when I tried to recast the transmission onto my Apple TV it wouldn’t or couldn’t find it.  Had to watch the whole show on a mini-tablet.  Not the most comfortable viewing experience and it took away from the beauty of the scenery in the show.  It also is constantly circling and it does require you to sign in with your cable provider... what’s the point of that?  I want to unplug not have to stay connected or have to up my plan to watch this show....defeats the purpose.  Must be a licensing thing.  Yellowstone is a great drama set in Wyoming (but filmed in Utah).  Beautiful vistas, terrific actors, lots of lawless killing though, but that’s the way of the West they want to present.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I had a problem signing in. I received an email from Paramount Network notifying me the issue documented below had been resolved. The new app seems to have more episodes of what I watch with a cleaner appearance, now that I can use it I think it’s a worth while update. I am only giving it 3 stars because even though there is more episodes to choose from none of the episodes have any order. There could be season 1 episode 3 next to season 4 episode 16 and so on. This can get confusing. App publishers have to learn apps and the internet are now a real way to watch Tv and adjust  apps for ease of use and simplicity. At least thats the way it should be. Seasons and Episodes have numbers for a reason. Paramount has good customer service. I’m sure this will be fixed  one day. It just seems an update and name change or rebranding was the perfect opportunity.<br /><br />The resolved Apple TV sign in issue mentioned above....<br /><br />I have a subscription through my provider. My provider insist it’s supposed to work as it has in the past. I used to watch this channel and enjoy app access. Now I cannot sign into this app on Apple TV without a subscription error message displaying. This is a new problem that did not happen before the “rebranding” if it ain’t broke don’t fix it.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I got really excited for this app because it has a few shows I used to watch all the time and this was an opportunity for me to binge whilst quarantined... but let me sum up my thoughts with one word: GARBAGE. I initially downloaded this for Firestick 4K TV. It plays an episodes for 4 minutes, then starts to lag, then crashes and freezes up my BRAND NEW Firestick. I uninstalled and reinstalled thinking this may fix it. Incorrect. All my other streaming apps are running flawlessly without a single problem. I thought it would improve if I downloaded on my iPhone, same problems. <br /><br />Other issues: (1) after an episode crashes, the app constantly thinks I don’t have my provider log in. (2) if I was lucky enough to get 10 minutes in before it crashed, it makes you start the episode over when you go back in and plays ads (3) holy ads. So. Many. Ads. For example: Ink Masters. You start off with 4 ads for about 2 minutes, it plays a quick recap of the previous episodes, then goes to another sets of 4 ads before even really getting into the episode. <br /><br />So frustrating. I really was looking forward to this app streaming, but the app is just trash. It should be taken out to the back of the barn and shot, hire new developers, implement Agile, and get a good product on the market.</p>

Awesome show.  The app needs some work though.  They’ve fixed the show order sequence.

Not the most comfortable viewing experience and it took away from the beauty of the scenery in the show.  It also is constantly circling and it does require you to sign in with your cable provider... what’s the point of that?  I want to unplug not have to stay connected or have to up my plan to watch this show....defeats the purpose.  Must be a licensing thing.

I am only giving it 3 stars because even though there is more episodes to choose from none of the episodes have any order. There could be season 1 episode 3 next to season 4 episode 16 and so on. This can get confusing. App publishers have to learn apps and the internet are now a real way to watch Tv and adjust  apps for ease of use and simplicity. At least thats the way it should be. Seasons and Episodes have numbers for a reason. Paramount has good customer service. I’m sure this will be fixed  one day. It just seems an update and name change or rebranding was the perfect opportunity.\n\nThe resolved Apple TV sign in issue mentioned above....\n\nI have a subscription through my provider.

I initially downloaded this for Firestick 4K TV. It plays an episodes for 4 minutes, then starts to lag, then crashes and freezes up my BRAND NEW Firestick. I uninstalled and reinstalled thinking this may fix it. Incorrect. All my other streaming apps are running flawlessly without a single problem. I thought it would improve if I downloaded on my iPhone, same problems. \n\nOther issues: (1) after an episode crashes, the app constantly thinks I don’t have my provider log in. (2) if I was lucky enough to get 10 minutes in before it crashed, it makes you start the episode over when you go back in and plays ads (3) holy ads. So. Many. Ads. For example: Ink Masters. You start off with 4 ads for about 2 minutes, it plays a quick recap of the previous episodes, then goes to another sets of 4 ads before even really getting into the episode. \n\nSo frustrating. I really was looking forward to this app streaming, but the app is just trash.

Somehow if you click on certain seasons of Ink Master they’re missing episodes and there’s no way to access them. If you go to paramount network on a laptop they’re there but they’re not on the mobile app. Incredibly frustrating app, clearly needs a lot of work.
