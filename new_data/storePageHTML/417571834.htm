        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Thanks for using Private Photo Vault! We have been working hard to create a new update to make sure you always have the best app for securing your photos. <br /><br />In v12.5, we have completely redone the User Interface, User Experience, and have added new features.<br /><br />New Features: <br /><br />+ Favorites<br />+ Up to 8 digit passcodes to login to the app<br /><br />+ Cloud Vault (Premium)<br />   + Encrypted Backup<br />      + 100% Private (just like the app has always been) - Private Photo Vault employees CAN NOT view your photos and videos in the app on your phone or in Cloud Vault Backups. For a complete description on how Cloud Vault encryption works, scroll to the bottom.<br />   + Sync photos and videos between multiple devices<br />   + Space Saver - leave files in Cloud Vault and download them on demand<br />+ Trash (Premium)<br />   + Recover recently deleted files<br />+ Face Down Lock (Premium)<br />   + Feature to switch to a different app when the device is turned over<br />+ Dark Mode (Pro/Premium)<br />   + Professionally designed dark mode<br /><br />New Design: <br /><br />+ Brand new modern design<br />+ Simplified method for adding new files to the app<br />+ New easier onboarding process for new users<br />+ Swipe down to dismiss images<br />+ Improved animations<br /><br />Other improvements/changes:<br /><br />+ Performance improvements<br />+ Photo Gallery has significantly improved performance when swiping between photos<br />+ The iTunes album no longer exists as an album you can move photos/videos to/from. Now, you can choose to export files to iTunes and import from there.<br />+ Bugfixes<br /><br />How Cloud Vault Encryption works:<br /><br />+ When you enable Cloud Vault backup in the app, you are required to provide a Cloud Vault Password. Your Cloud Vault Password is never backed up to our servers and is used as a secret value that only you know to encrypt/decrypt your files. This means we have NO ability to view your photos. This also means that if you forget your Cloud Vault Password, you will also not be able to view your Cloud Vault data. Please write it down.<br /><br />New Offering:<br /><br />We are announcing a new Premium offering with this update. If you have already purchased the Pro version of the app, you will always be able to continue using the features you paid for, for free. However, if you want to try any of the new features including Cloud Vault backup and syncing, you will need to try our new upgrade. All existing Pro customers users will be given 3 months of Premium as a thank you for supporting the app.</p>

    Best in class for photo security
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>One of my friends recommended this app to me years ago for securing my private photos and videos. I’ve now been using it since 2015, it continues to be supported with each new version of iOS and they provide good customer support when needed. <br /><br />To break down the features that I like, the break-in report and decoy password are really cool. The break in report will take a photo whenever someone tries to get into the app. It is great for detecting snoopers. The decoy password gives you a whole separate account you can login to that opens to a different set of photos. This is perfect if someone wants to know what is in the app. <br /><br />The app has the ability to create a pin for the overall app as well as passwords for each of the individual albums. <br /><br />When you import photos from the photos app, it asks you if you’d like to delete them from the Photos app which is really convenient. Just make sure you also delete them from recently deleted too. <br /><br />Looking at some of the reviews, it looks like people are forgetting their passwords. The app gives you the ability to set a backup email address, so if you set that setup you are fine. <br /><br />Each update brings new features. I’m glad to have picked this one. It is fast, secure, reliable and feature rich. I highly recommend this app if you want a well supported app for securing your photos. I’m excited to see what they add next.</p>

    Great App Until You Lose your Phone and all Pictures are Lost
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been a regular user of photo vault. I started with the regular version and then paid to get upgraded to the pro version. Everything seemed fine even until I lost my iPhone in summer 2019 during my research trip and had to restore/recover lost data. Lol and behold, not even a single one of the over 3,000 archival/research document pics that I got and moved to the vault were restored; I mean, not even a single one. I tried restoring from my itunes and iCloud yet no way. Never trust this app to recover your lost photo files. To make matters worse, I wrote several emails to the developers and even went to their company website to lodge a request to Legendary Software Labs LLC and not even a single response. At least, if you cannot solve the situation, calm your clients and respond to a single request. I cannot believe that after paying the monthly fee, I cannot even recover any thing. I felt frustrated because I so much believed in this app and even got my friends to get it. Now, I am lost and disappointed to say the least. Thanks but no thanks.</p>

    Tech Support will not reply

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>First off I’ve used this product for years without any issues. Recently they released Ver 10.3 I believe and it was automatically downloaded and updated my app. I noticed there must have been an update after seeing a much improved editor when I edited a vid. I closed the app, reopened it 15 minutes later and all of my files were encrypted or at least I’m assuming that because over 3,000 pics &amp; vids showed nothing but the grayscale wave in all the directories. That’s it, the only viewable file out of almost 3,000 was the one I edited. I’ve tried texting, emailing, copying, etc out of the app but nadda! <br />I have pics of everything critical in there. My last backup was over 3 months ago. That puts me out of almost a thousand pics &amp; vids. I can’t get a Tech support reply, I’ve sent multiple request for help but nothing. I’m very frustrated that their success has given them a sense of complacency to my need for help. <br />I have almost 75gb of data (+-3000 files)that only shows up as a defective wave. I need those pics to access accounts created in the past few months. BE WARNED-Back up you iPhone on a frequent basis. <br />Help!!!!!!!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>First of all, sorry about any problem. If you have performed a recent backup of your device to iTunes, I recommend restoring your device to the previous backup. After restoring, before opening the app, immediately update to the latest version of the app in the app store and then everything should be there. We apologize for this problem, it is affecting a very small number (~300 users out of millions) of our users overall, but we want our app to be completely bug free and don&#39;t want anyone to have a bad experience.</p>

I’ve now been using it since 2015, it continues to be supported with each new version of iOS and they provide good customer support when needed. \n\nTo break down the features that I like, the break-in report and decoy password are really cool. The break in report will take a photo whenever someone tries to get into the app. It is great for detecting snoopers. The decoy password gives you a whole separate account you can login to that opens to a different set of photos. This is perfect if someone wants to know what is in the app. \n\nThe app has the ability to create a pin for the overall app as well as passwords for each of the individual albums. \n\nWhen you import photos from the photos app, it asks you if you’d like to delete them from the Photos app which is really convenient. Just make sure you also delete them from recently deleted too. \n\nLooking at some of the reviews, it looks like people are forgetting their passwords. The app gives you the ability to set a backup email address, so if you set that setup you are fine. \n\nEach update brings new features. I’m glad to have picked this one. It is fast, secure, reliable and feature rich. I highly recommend this app if you want a well supported app for securing your photos. I’m excited to see what they add next.","title":"Best in class for photo security","userName":"Appleman7934"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4754352481","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-09-09T18:31:53Z","rating":3,"review":"I have been a regular user of photo vault. I started with the regular version and then paid to get upgraded to the pro version. Everything seemed fine even until I lost my iPhone in summer 2019 during my research trip and had to restore/recover lost data. Lol and behold, not even a single one of the over 3,000 archival/research document pics that I got and moved to the vault were restored; I mean, not even a single one. I tried restoring from my itunes and iCloud yet no way. Never trust this app to recover your lost photo files. To make matters worse, I wrote several emails to the developers and even went to their company website to lodge a request to Legendary Software Labs LLC and not even a single response.

Currently it's pretty well developed. The only issue I've ever had was losing 400+ pictures/videos due to the app not backing up to iCloud (2 years ago). I lost my phone while on a trip in Europe, after returning I tried a backup only to find that all data within the app was lost (literally as if I had never used the app before). I tried a fresh backup several times, each with the same results. Going into detail: I used photo vault for 2 years prior to the loss of the phone. I had pictures in my stock photo album that were dated same as some photos in the photo vault. The backup recovered 700+ pictures that were in my photo album (and other apps/app data) ... some dating up to just a couple weeks before I lost the phone. Basically I guess photo vault was never backed up, while just about everything else was? You'd think after paying for the pricey Pro Version and 2 years of constant use, there would be some element of assurance...

It’s extremely safe because you need a password to open the app and another password to open the hidden albums (if you want to be 100%  safe, you don’t necessarily have to). The only thing I think is missing is that I wish the app would save my pictures on my “profile”. Since it’s deleted from my phone and hidden inside the app, you would think that the pictures are saved on some type of cloud or inside the app itself but it isn’t. I switched phones and lost many pictures and videos because I didn’t think of downloading them onto my computer before switching phones. I also hoped that since I use an email and password it would save them somehow but it’s not the case.

I hope they have made a real fix 🙂. It’d been bothering me for almost a year, that importing multiple items resulted in them being placed in a random order. The new interface is cleaner than before, too. And the app “remembers” which album it was in when it was last used more often than before, which is a good convenience feature. (It may depend on your device’s RAM…) Anyway, I bought the new Premium subscription to support the developer, and I hope they use their own app on a daily basis and fix bugs more often 🙂. Uprated from 1 star for version 10.x back to 5 stars which was my rating for years before the random-order bug surfaced. But recently it kept refreshing the photo database upon launch; I gave over 100,000 photos and this always takes a long time even on an M1 iPad. So 4 stars for now.

I figured I’d try the WiFi sync which I got to login but once I click the album, the app crashes on my phone and the page won’t load. I tried to export the photos and the same thing. Needless to say the developers have yet to address this issue and are blaming the way the phone is backed up, yet all my other apps seem to be working.
