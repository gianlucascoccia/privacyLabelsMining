  <script id="ember28581450" name="schema:software-application" class="ember-view" type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"SoftwareApplication","name":"RadarScope","description":"RadarScope is a specialized display utility for weather enthusiasts and meteorologists that allows you view NEXRAD Level 3 and super-resolution radar data along with tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine and snow squall warnings, and predicted storm tracks issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. It can display the latest reflectivity, velocity, dual-polarization, and other products from any NEXRAD or TDWR radar site in the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, Korea, and Okinawa, as well as data from Environment Canada, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Finnish Meteorological Institute, and German Weather Service radars. These aren't smoothed images, this is native radar data rendered in its original radial format for a high level of detail. \n\nWhether you are scanning reflectivity for a mesocyclone's tell-tale hook echo, trying to pinpoint the landfall of a hurricane's eye wall, or looking for small features like velocity couplets in the storm relative radial velocity product, RadarScope gives you the power to view true radial weather radar data.\n\nRadarScope displays tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine, and snow squall warnings issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. You can browse the list of active warnings, select a warning to view the details, and even zoom to the selected warning on the map.\n\nPinch or stretch to zoom in and out. Drag your finger around the map to scroll. Tap the radar sweep button in the toolbar to switch radars. Select one of the 289 different radars in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Korea, Puerto Rico, Guam, or Okinawa. Plot your current location by tapping the location button and optionally report it to the Spotter Network. Tap the play button to download and animate over recent images. Display the names of over 25,000 cities and towns on the map as you zoom and scroll. Tap and hold the color legend to see the data values. \n\nMeanwhile, RadarScope will retrieve and display updated data automatically and intelligently (approximately every 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the radar scan strategy). \n\nYou can display radar data from our servers, NOAA's public access web site, or your Allison House subscriber account. Spotter Network members can report their location and view the locations of other spotters.\n\nRadarScope Pro is an optional auto-renewing subscription with two different tiers to choose from.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier One is an annual subscription that provides access to real-time lightning data in the U.S. and Canada that animates along with the radar loop and up to 30 frames of radar data, including extended loops of super-resolution data. Tier One subscribers can also access a data interrogation tool to quickly determine data values for specific radar pixels and an optional dual-pane mode for viewing two radar products side-by-side.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier Two is an annual or monthly subscription that combines all the features in Tier One with more advanced features, including SPC outlooks, mesoscale discussions, local storm reports, hail size and probability contours, and azimuthal shear contours in the U.S., a 30-day archive of all radar products, and the ability to use subscription features across multiple platforms.\n\nIf you choose to buy the RadarScope Pro subscription, it will charged to your iTunes account. The subscription will be auto-renewed within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price you originally paid.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>RadarScope is a specialized display utility for weather enthusiasts and meteorologists that allows you view NEXRAD Level 3 and super-resolution radar data along with tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine and snow squall warnings, and predicted storm tracks issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. It can display the latest reflectivity, velocity, dual-polarization, and other products from any NEXRAD or TDWR radar site in the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, Korea, and Okinawa, as well as data from Environment Canada, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Finnish Meteorological Institute, and German Weather Service radars. These aren&#39;t smoothed images, this is native radar data rendered in its original radial format for a high level of detail. <br /><br />Whether you are scanning reflectivity for a mesocyclone&#39;s tell-tale hook echo, trying to pinpoint the landfall of a hurricane&#39;s eye wall, or looking for small features like velocity couplets in the storm relative radial velocity product, RadarScope gives you the power to view true radial weather radar data.<br /><br />RadarScope displays tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine, and snow squall warnings issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. You can browse the list of active warnings, select a warning to view the details, and even zoom to the selected warning on the map.<br /><br />Pinch or stretch to zoom in and out. Drag your finger around the map to scroll. Tap the radar sweep button in the toolbar to switch radars. Select one of the 289 different radars in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Korea, Puerto Rico, Guam, or Okinawa. Plot your current location by tapping the location button and optionally report it to the Spotter Network. Tap the play button to download and animate over recent images. Display the names of over 25,000 cities and towns on the map as you zoom and scroll. Tap and hold the color legend to see the data values. <br /><br />Meanwhile, RadarScope will retrieve and display updated data automatically and intelligently (approximately every 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the radar scan strategy). <br /><br />You can display radar data from our servers, NOAA&#39;s public access web site, or your Allison House subscriber account. Spotter Network members can report their location and view the locations of other spotters.<br /><br />RadarScope Pro is an optional auto-renewing subscription with two different tiers to choose from.<br /><br />RadarScope Pro Tier One is an annual subscription that provides access to real-time lightning data in the U.S. and Canada that animates along with the radar loop and up to 30 frames of radar data, including extended loops of super-resolution data. Tier One subscribers can also access a data interrogation tool to quickly determine data values for specific radar pixels and an optional dual-pane mode for viewing two radar products side-by-side.<br /><br />RadarScope Pro Tier Two is an annual or monthly subscription that combines all the features in Tier One with more advanced features, including SPC outlooks, mesoscale discussions, local storm reports, hail size and probability contours, and azimuthal shear contours in the U.S., a 30-day archive of all radar products, and the ability to use subscription features across multiple platforms.<br /><br />If you choose to buy the RadarScope Pro subscription, it will charged to your iTunes account. The subscription will be auto-renewed within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price you originally paid. Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal disabled via your iTunes Account Settings after the purchase. Once purchased, the subscription cannot be cancelled during the active subscription period.<br /><br />DTN is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.

    Fantastic, except for Apple Watch version
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The iPad version of RadarScope is unsurpassed for this weather geek; haven’t seen anything better.  However the Apple Watch app version is very disappointing.  I have removed it.  It does not know what it wants to be.  I need an untethered Watch radar app  to use when out on a run, walking the dog, or on a ride.  Although it is intended to work while untethered, with my usage and Verizon etc, it loads a radar image less than 10% of the time I try to use it untethered.  90% of the time it loads nothing or occasionally returns a “failure to to connect to parent app” error.  I have gotten caught in downbursts that I could have avoided if the app would have shown me local radar and/or lightning when I needed the info.  In addition, I do not need to see, on my tiny watch screen, the myriad different products available from my local radar station (KLIX); that is what my iPad/phone version is for.  Finally, I do not find the watch app to be useful in tethered mode either; I inevitably would rather have a look at the radar on my phone instead.  Please redesign the watch app to be reliable in untethered mode even if it means losing many of the specialist radar products.</p>

    Best radar
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The other reviewers are right-- this is the best radar and well worth the cost.  I had purchased several others and put off this one because of the price.  The other apps disappointed-- they have been inaccurate or slow to update.  This one is precise and quick--so far is has never been more than a minute or two before it updates and most often it is up to the moment.  And the accuracy has been brilliant.  It has many features that I have not yet used, but i hope to learn them soon.  I&#39;m a weather novice, but I definitely want to know where the storms are, where they&#39;re going, and how much rain we&#39;ll get.  This is the best radar by far!<br />Update: the developer keeps refining an already brilliant application.  This is THE  radar application, far superior to any other out there.  Absolutely one of the best purchases I&#39;ve ever made for my iOS devices—beautiful on the iPad, crucial app on the phone, and a very informative glance at the radar on the watch.  <br />I bought the upgraded pro version and like the additional features:  longer loops and lightening info.  As with the basic version of this app, the cost is there but well worth it:  this radar and all the features are the some of the best things on my phone.  One of the top apps of any kind and one I will subscribe to without hesitation every year.</p>

    Needs a couple more features
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love this radar app and it’s by far the best on the market. I have nothing to complain about, however I do wish there was one added feature that would greatly improve it. I enjoy watching the radar and looking at storms even when they’re not near me, especially tornado warned storms. The only problem is when I see the storms, I can only see the general location of the storm with respect to cities. I wish there was a feature that allowed me to see the precise location of where certain storms are. Even if it was just something where I pressed my finger and it pulled up the latitude and longitude coordinates so I could search them. It would make it a lot more enjoyable for me and would help me to know exactly what houses or businesses are being affected rather than general locations.<br /><br />Another feature I would like to see is the ability to change the four quick select radars. I would love to have the choice of what four radars I can choose from when holding down on it. I would especially like to see the super res of reflectivity, velocity, specific differential phase, and correlation coefficient. As of right now, unfortunately I am forced to quick select the ones given and have to scroll a lot for the ones I want to see.</p>

Policy\nLast Modified: May 25, 2018\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to the websites and services offered by DTN (referred to as “DTN”, “we” or “us” in this Privacy Policy) including dtn.com, dtnpf.com, mydtn.com, and all other DTN related websites (collectively, the “Sites”), as well as all downloadable software, mobile applications, and other services provided by DTN and on which a link to this Privacy Policy is displayed (collectively, together with the Sites, our “Services”).\n\nWe respect individual privacy and value the confidence of our customers, employees, business partners, and others. We strive to collect, use, and disclose personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which we do business and have a tradition of upholding the highest ethical standards in our business practices.\n\nThis Privacy Policy describes the personal information that we gather on or through our Services, how we use and disclose such information, the steps we take to protect your information, and the rights you may have related to our information collection and use practices. By visiting the Sites, or by purchasing or using our Services, you accept the privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nThis Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is subject to, the DTN terms of use at www.dtn.com/tos.\n\n\nHow and What Information We Collect\n\nUser-Provided Information. We collect personally identifiable information voluntarily provided by users or visitors of our Services (also referred to as “Users” or “you” in this Privacy Policy), including when you visit the Sites, use the Services, register an account, fill out forms on the Sites, or otherwise contact us. The personal information that we collect on or through our Services may include your first and last name, email address, mailing address, telephone number(s), organizational affiliation, credit card or other billing information, and any other information you choose to provide when you use the Services or otherwise interact with us.\n\nLocation Information. Some of our Sites and mobile apps also collect geo-location information. We use your location information to provide requested location-specific services, including local weather forecasts and asset tracking. You may at any time opt-out from further allowing us to have access to your location data by turning off the location services in your mobile phone or browser settings. Please be aware that certain features of the mobile apps will not perform as expected if location services are turned off.\n\nAutomatically Collected Information. As is true of most websites and mobile applications, we or our third party service providers and partners (discussed below) collect information from you over time using automated means such as cookies, beacons, or online data analytics tools. This “automatically collected” information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, MAC addresses, device IDs, device and browser type(s), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, or clickstream data and other information about the way you use the Services. Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, this information may or may not be considered personal information. We also use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with DTN-related links appearing on third-party websites or in a DTN-generated email, such as whether you click on or forward a link or message. We may link this automatically collected data to other information you provide or we collect from you.\n\nDTN does not directly track you when you visit other websites or engage in other activities online, so we do not register Do Not Track (DNT) signals from your browser.  However, you should review the privacy policies of other third parties that may be operating on our Sites (discussed below) to determine whether they honor DNT signals. For more information on “do not track” options, please see: http://donottrack.us/.\n\u2028\nHow We Use Your Information\u2028\nWe use the personal information we collect about you to solicit, service, and communicate with you or as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy. In particular, we will use your information (a) as is necessary for the performance of contracts we have with you, or at your request prior to you entering into a contract with us (e.g., to send you product or billing information); (b) in ways that you likely expect and that will have minimal privacy impact in order to further our legitimate interests (e.g., to contact you following a tradeshow or to provide requested trial services); or (c) for any other purpose for which we have your consent (e.g., to send you ongoing marketing and promotional information). DTN does not use your personal information to make solely automated decisions about you or to make decisions about you that are likely to produce legal or similarly significant effects.\n\nIf you receive commercial emails from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions contained within the email or by sending an email to the address provided in the “Contact Us” section below. Please be aware that if you opt-out of receiving commercial email from us, it may take up to ten (10) business days for us to process your request. Additionally, even after you opt-out from receiving commercial messages from us, you will continue to receive otherwise permitted administrative messages from us regarding the Services.\n\nAt times DTN may allow a customer to purchase or lease products or equipment and/or to make payments through the Services. In such event, DTN may use a third-party shipping company, such as UPS or FedEX, to fulfill customer orders through the Sites, and may also use a credit card processing company to bill you for goods or services that you request. The current credit card processing company that DTN uses to store and process credit card transactions is called CyberSource®, and more information about this company can be found at: http://www.cybersource.com/. DTN takes all reasonable measures to select third-party agents for fulfillment and financial processing that agree to not retain, share, store, or use your personal or financial information for any other purposes than fulfilling orders or enforcing customer agreements.\n\nWe use analytics tools such as Google Analytics and Eloqua to analyze trends, administer and improve our Services, and track Users’ movements around the Services and on the Internet, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. These third party analytics companies do not seek to identify individual users or to receive personally identifiable information except as may occur when they use your IP address.  This information helps us to improve our Services and deliver a better and more personalized service. Many of these companies, such as Google Analytics, collect and use information under their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. For more information about Google Analytics or Eloqua analytics and their privacy policies, please visit the Google Analytics privacy page and/or the Google Partners’ Page and the Eloqua privacy page. You may opt-out of Google Analytics or Eloqua web monitoring by following the instructions on the Google Analytics Web Monitoring Opt-Out page or the Eloqua Web Monitoring Opt-Out page.\u2028\nWe may also partner with a third party, including our current partner AdRoll, to display advertising on our Services and/or to manage our advertising on other websites and platforms. Such third parties, including AdRoll, use automated technologies such as those described above to gather information about your activities on the Services and other websites or platforms in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the content provider or AdRoll directly.

It can display the latest reflectivity, velocity, dual-polarization, and other products from any NEXRAD or TDWR radar site in the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, Korea, and Okinawa, as well as data from Environment Canada, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Finnish Meteorological Institute, and German Weather Service radars. These aren't smoothed images, this is native radar data rendered in its original radial format for a high level of detail. \n\nWhether you are scanning reflectivity for a mesocyclone's tell-tale hook echo, trying to pinpoint the landfall of a hurricane's eye wall, or looking for small features like velocity couplets in the storm relative radial velocity product, RadarScope gives you the power to view true radial weather radar data.\n\nRadarScope displays tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine, and snow squall warnings issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. You can browse the list of active warnings, select a warning to view the details, and even zoom to the selected warning on the map.\n\nPan and zoom around the map using your Siri Remote. Select one of the 307 different radars in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Korea, Puerto Rico, Guam, or Okinawa. Tap the play button to download and animate over recent images. Display the names of over 25,000 cities and towns on the map as you zoom and scroll.\n\nMeanwhile, RadarScope will retrieve and display updated data automatically and intelligently (approximately every 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the radar scan strategy). \n\nYou can display data from NOAA's public access web site, our optional WDT feed (the default), or your AllisonHouse subscriber account. Spotter Network members can view the locations of other spotters.\n\nYou can display radar data from our servers, NOAA's public access web site, or your Allison House subscriber account.\n\nRadarScope Pro is an optional auto-renewing subscription with two different tiers to choose from.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier One is an annual subscription that provides access to real-time lightning data in the U.S. and Canada that animates along with the radar loop and up to 30 frames of radar data, including extended loops of super-resolution data. Tier One subscribers can also access a data interrogation tool to quickly determine data values for specific radar pixels and an optional dual-pane mode for viewing two radar products side-by-side.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier Two is an annual or monthly subscription that combines all the features in Tier One with more advanced features, including SPC outlooks, mesoscale discussions, local storm reports, hail size and probability contours, and azimuthal shear contours in the U.S., a 30-day archive of all radar products, and the ability to use subscription features across multiple platforms.\n\nIf you choose to buy the RadarScope Pro subscription, it will charged to your iTunes account. The subscription will be auto-renewed within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price you originally paid. Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal disabled via your iTunes Account Settings after the purchase. Once purchased, the subscription cannot be cancelled during the active subscription period.\n\nDTN is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.

We strive to collect, use, and disclose personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which we do business and have a tradition of upholding the highest ethical standards in our business practices.\n\nThis Privacy Policy describes the personal information that we gather on or through our Services, how we use and disclose such information, the steps we take to protect your information, and the rights you may have related to our information collection and use practices. By visiting the Sites, or by purchasing or using our Services, you accept the privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nThis Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is subject to, the DTN terms of use at www.dtn.com/tos.\n\n\nHow and What Information We Collect\n\nUser-Provided Information. We collect personally identifiable information voluntarily provided by users or visitors of our Services (also referred to as “Users” or “you” in this Privacy Policy), including when you visit the Sites, use the Services, register an account, fill out forms on the Sites, or otherwise contact us. The personal information that we collect on or through our Services may include your first and last name, email address, mailing address, telephone number(s), organizational affiliation, credit card or other billing information, and any other information you choose to provide when you use the Services or otherwise interact with us.\n\nLocation Information. Some of our Sites and mobile apps also collect geo-location information. We use your location information to provide requested location-specific services, including local weather forecasts and asset tracking. You may at any time opt-out from further allowing us to have access to your location data by turning off the location services in your mobile phone or browser settings. Please be aware that certain features of the mobile apps will not perform as expected if location services are turned off.\n\nAutomatically Collected Information. As is true of most websites and mobile applications, we or our third party service providers and partners (discussed below) collect information from you over time using automated means such as cookies, beacons, or online data analytics tools. This “automatically collected” information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, MAC addresses, device IDs, device and browser type(s), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, or clickstream data and other information about the way you use the Services. Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, this information may or may not be considered personal information. We also use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with DTN-related links appearing on third-party websites or in a DTN-generated email, such as whether you click on or forward a link or message. We may link this automatically collected data to other information you provide or we collect from you.\n\nDTN does not directly track you when you visit other websites or engage in other activities online, so we do not register Do Not Track (DNT) signals from your browser.  However, you should review the privacy policies of other third parties that may be operating on our Sites (discussed below) to determine whether they honor DNT signals. For more information on “do not track” options, please see: http://donottrack.us/.\n\u2028\nHow We Use Your Information\u2028\nWe use the personal information we collect about you to solicit, service, and communicate with you or as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy. In particular, we will use your information (a) as is necessary for the performance of contracts we have with you, or at your request prior to you entering into a contract with us (e.g., to send you product or billing information); (b) in ways that you likely expect and that will have minimal privacy impact in order to further our legitimate interests (e.g., to contact you following a tradeshow or to provide requested trial services); or (c) for any other purpose for which we have your consent (e.g., to send you ongoing marketing and promotional information). DTN does not use your personal information to make solely automated decisions about you or to make decisions about you that are likely to produce legal or similarly significant effects.\n\nIf you receive commercial emails from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions contained within the email or by sending an email to the address provided in the “Contact Us” section below. Please be aware that if you opt-out of receiving commercial email from us, it may take up to ten (10) business days for us to process your request. Additionally, even after you opt-out from receiving commercial messages from us, you will continue to receive otherwise permitted administrative messages from us regarding the Services.\n\nAt times DTN may allow a customer to purchase or lease products or equipment and/or to make payments through the Services. In such event, DTN may use a third-party shipping company, such as UPS or FedEX, to fulfill customer orders through the Sites, and may also use a credit card processing company to bill you for goods or services that you request. The current credit card processing company that DTN uses to store and process credit card transactions is called CyberSource®, and more information about this company can be found at: http://www.cybersource.com/. DTN takes all reasonable measures to select third-party agents for fulfillment and financial processing that agree to not retain, share, store, or use your personal or financial information for any other purposes than fulfilling orders or enforcing customer agreements.\n\nWe use analytics tools such as Google Analytics and Eloqua to analyze trends, administer and improve our Services, and track Users’ movements around the Services and on the Internet, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. These third party analytics companies do not seek to identify individual users or to receive personally identifiable information except as may occur when they use your IP address.  This information helps us to improve our Services and deliver a better and more personalized service. Many of these companies, such as Google Analytics, collect and use information under their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. For more information about Google Analytics or Eloqua analytics and their privacy policies, please visit the Google Analytics privacy page and/or the Google Partners’ Page and the Eloqua privacy page. You may opt-out of Google Analytics or Eloqua web monitoring by following the instructions on the Google Analytics Web Monitoring Opt-Out page or the Eloqua Web Monitoring Opt-Out page.\u2028\nWe may also partner with a third party, including our current partner AdRoll, to display advertising on our Services and/or to manage our advertising on other websites and platforms. Such third parties, including AdRoll, use automated technologies such as those described above to gather information about your activities on the Services and other websites or platforms in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the content provider or AdRoll directly. We encourage you to review AdRolls’ privacy policies, including information on how to opt-out of receiving targeted ads served by AdRoll, please visit the AdRoll privacy page. Users interested in learning more about online advertising and/or opting out of online ads can visit http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/ and its websites http://aboutads.info and http://youradchoices.com.\n\nDTN may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on DTN or the Services; (b) protect or defend the rights of property of DTN and its Services; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of DTN employees, users of DTN products or services, or members of the general public.\u2028\nDTN does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. When you give us personal information, DTN will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions and purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.\n\u2028\nUse of Cookies\n\nAs mentioned above, the Services utilize ‘cookies’ to provide custom content, including targeted ads, and to measure visitation patterns and user preferences.

They may also be used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement, as well as to help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They remember that you have visited a website and this non-identifiable information may be shared with other organizations, such as advertisers. This means that after you have been to our Sites, you may see some advertisements about our Services elsewhere on the Internet.\n\nThird-Party Cookies. These are cookies that fall into one of the above categories, but are placed on your browsing device by a third party.We allow third parties with which we have a separate agreement to use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Sites, including, for example, when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on the Sites or to collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of their advertisements. We do not share with these third parties any information that would readily identify you (such as email address); however, such parties have limited access to a small amount of information about your device, which is necessary to serve you advertisements on our Sites and on other sites across the Internet that are tailored to your apparent interests.\n\nYou can use the browser with which you are viewing the Sites to enable, disable or delete our (first party) cookies. To do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” settings). Please note, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas of the Sites. Also, if you disable cookies other parts of the Sites may not work properly. You can find more information about how to change your browser cookie settings at http://www.allaboutcookies.org.\u2028\nWhile third parties that set cookies on our Sites provide a service to us or functionality, as noted above, you should review the third party’s websites, included those listed in the section above, for more information on how they use cookies or about how to opt-out of their cookie-based collection.

DTN will retain and use your personal information as necessary to comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce its agreements.\n\nAt any time, end users in the European Economic Area may object to the processing of your Personal Data, on legitimate grounds, except if otherwise permitted by applicable law.  Such users also have the right to file a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority. \n\u2028\nLinks and Third Party Websites\u2028\nThe Sites may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. We encourage our Users to read the privacy statements of each and every website they visit. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Sites and does not apply to these third-party websites. The ability to access information of third parties from the Services, or links to other websites or locations, is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such third parties, their products, their services, other websites, locations, or their content.\n\nAlso, DTN may allow select third parties to offer subscription services or fee-based products through the Sites.

It can display the latest reflectivity, velocity, dual-polarization, and other products from any NEXRAD or TDWR radar site in the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, Korea, and Okinawa, as well as data from Environment Canada, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Finnish Meteorological Institute, and German Weather Service radars. These aren't smoothed images, this is native radar data rendered in its original radial format for a high level of detail. \n\nWhether you are scanning reflectivity for a mesocyclone's tell-tale hook echo, trying to pinpoint the landfall of a hurricane's eye wall, or looking for small features like velocity couplets in the storm relative radial velocity product, RadarScope gives you the power to view true radial weather radar data.\n\nRadarScope displays tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine, and snow squall warnings issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. You can browse the list of active warnings, select a warning to view the details, and even zoom to the selected warning on the map.\n\nPinch or stretch to zoom in and out. Drag your finger around the map to scroll. Tap the radar sweep button in the toolbar to switch radars. Select one of the 289 different radars in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Korea, Puerto Rico, Guam, or Okinawa. Plot your current location by tapping the location button and optionally report it to the Spotter Network. Tap the play button to download and animate over recent images. Display the names of over 25,000 cities and towns on the map as you zoom and scroll. Tap and hold the color legend to see the data values. \n\nMeanwhile, RadarScope will retrieve and display updated data automatically and intelligently (approximately every 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the radar scan strategy). \n\nYou can display radar data from our servers, NOAA's public access web site, or your Allison House subscriber account. Spotter Network members can report their location and view the locations of other spotters.\n\nRadarScope Pro is an optional auto-renewing subscription with two different tiers to choose from.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier One is an annual subscription that provides access to real-time lightning data in the U.S. and Canada that animates along with the radar loop and up to 30 frames of radar data, including extended loops of super-resolution data. Tier One subscribers can also access a data interrogation tool to quickly determine data values for specific radar pixels and an optional dual-pane mode for viewing two radar products side-by-side.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier Two is an annual or monthly subscription that combines all the features in Tier One with more advanced features, including SPC outlooks, mesoscale discussions, local storm reports, hail size and probability contours, and azimuthal shear contours in the U.S., a 30-day archive of all radar products, and the ability to use subscription features across multiple platforms.\n\nIf you choose to buy the RadarScope Pro subscription, it will charged to your iTunes account. The subscription will be auto-renewed within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price you originally paid. Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal disabled via your iTunes Account Settings after the purchase. Once purchased, the subscription cannot be cancelled during the active subscription period.\n\nDTN is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.

However the Apple Watch app version is very disappointing.  I have removed it.  It does not know what it wants to be.  I need an untethered Watch radar app  to use when out on a run, walking the dog, or on a ride.  Although it is intended to work while untethered, with my usage and Verizon etc, it loads a radar image less than 10% of the time I try to use it untethered.  90% of the time it loads nothing or occasionally returns a “failure to to connect to parent app” error.  I have gotten caught in downbursts that I could have avoided if the app would have shown me local radar and/or lightning when I needed the info.  In addition, I do not need to see, on my tiny watch screen, the myriad different products available from my local radar station (KLIX); that is what my iPad/phone version is for.  Finally, I do not find the watch app to be useful in tethered mode either; I inevitably would rather have a look at the radar on my phone instead.  Please redesign the watch app to be reliable in untethered mode even if it means losing many of the specialist radar products.","title":"Fantastic, except for Apple Watch version","userName":"sasha_nola"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2345993317","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-03-25T19:16:18Z","rating":5,"review":"The other reviewers are right-- this is the best radar and well worth the cost.

This is the best radar by far!\nUpdate: the developer keeps refining an already brilliant application.  This is THE  radar application, far superior to any other out there.  Absolutely one of the best purchases I've ever made for my iOS devices—beautiful on the iPad, crucial app on the phone, and a very informative glance at the radar on the watch.  \nI bought the upgraded pro version and like the additional features:  longer loops and lightening info.  As with the basic version of this app, the cost is there but well worth it:  this radar and all the features are the some of the best things on my phone.  One of the top apps of any kind and one I will subscribe to without hesitation every year.","title":"Best radar","userName":"hstnnn"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6370115680","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-08-28T12:43:56Z","rating":5,"review":"I love this radar app and it’s by far the best on the market. I have nothing to complain about, however I do wish there was one added feature that would greatly improve it. I enjoy watching the radar and looking at storms even when they’re not near me, especially tornado warned storms. The only problem is when I see the storms, I can only see the general location of the storm with respect to cities. I wish there was a feature that allowed me to see the precise location of where certain storms are. Even if it was just something where I pressed my finger and it pulled up the latitude and longitude coordinates so I could search them. It would make it a lot more enjoyable for me and would help me to know exactly what houses or businesses are being affected rather than general locations.\n\nAnother feature I would like to see is the ability to change the four quick select radars. I would love to have the choice of what four radars I can choose from when holding down on it. I would especially like to see the super res of reflectivity, velocity, specific differential phase, and correlation coefficient. As of right now, unfortunately I am forced to quick select the ones given and have to scroll a lot for the ones I want to see.","title":"Needs a couple more features","userName":"TStan97"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5042107747","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-10-28T17:33:48Z","rating":5,"review":"I have been a weather nerd since I was a little kid, and I’m a trained Skywarn Storm Spotter. I first downloaded this app in 2013 when a meteorologist mentioned it after I was complaining about how I struggled to find a decent one. Most radar apps have a smoothing algorithm that obliterates storm structure. This app does a beautiful job with with its radar display. I’ve struggled to find certain details like specific rotation data inside a supercell storm, the correlation coefficient to detect tornado debris, decent hurricane reflectivity to see structure of the rain bands as well as the rotation within (I live in Florida), or just basic resolution to see what part of the storm will hit my location. This app does it all and so much more that I could write a book on it. The features of data are endless. I’ve used it through Hurricane Matthew, Irma, and Dorian (and plenty of other tropical storms). The storm season here has me tracking several hundred storms over the years. I have it on my MacBook Pro and my iPhone. There’s a reason all the professionals, scientists, and storm chasers use this app. It’s the best $10 I’ve ever spent.","title":"No radar app can hold a candle to this one","userName":"Wolf By The Ears"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4141930682","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-05-13T02:38:06Z","rating":4,"review":"When I bought the app, I was definitely not the target audience. I couldn’t really identify storm structures in person, let alone on radar. After getting this app and learning a ton more, it is one of the best radars out there. Yeah, there is a pretty big paywall, but you already get loads and loads of data for free. As I have learned about and experience weather more and more, I’ve really shifted from the mindset of asking why people would pay for all of the features to being able to see why there’s a paywall.\n\nThe one thing that I dislike is that there isn’t any traditional map of roads, as well as certain cities that don’t show up entirely. Even if more cities showed up as I zoom in, that would be completely fine. It just gets somewhat frustrating when a friend tells me that he is near a cell in a certain city, there are dozens of warnings out, and I have to first find the city on a map before going to the warning this friend is referring to.\n\nOverall, the app is still phenomenal. It’s easy to use, provides loads of data, and is decently priced.","title":"I love it","userName":"robotfool228"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6308429803","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-08-12T01:02:35Z","rating":5,"review":"If you are looking for a radar that gives you the data straight, this is it. There are no smoothing algorithms for the radar so you can see what meteorologists see and make your own judgments. Even if all you know is green is good red is bad this radar is the best out there. There is a slight learning curve on what you are actually looking at and all the settings but the guide that’s built in gives you enough to get you started. Some people say this is all information you could find for free, which it is, but it won’t be nearly as convenient or as practical. 10$ isn’t anything for an app like this unless you are on the brink of being broke. If you decide to get this app and you just want the simpleton stuff just like me, select the super-res reflectivity chart and i turn on storm tracks in the settings. And just like that you have the best radar app on the market without even touching the weather nerd tools.","title":"The best high definition radar you can get on a phone","userName":"Someone 365936"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5878394837","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-29T06:31:57Z","rating":3,"review":"I’ll start this off by saying that if you’re looking for a way to view the highest res data available from the NWS’s network of radars on your phone, this does that, and it does it well enough, assuming only 5 frames of animation is fine with you.\n\nHowever, I really am a bit back and forth about the pricing of the base app. It feels a bit steep considering there is functionality that’s not included out of the box. Yes, I understand that the cost of development and running their services is not free. However, considering what you get in the base app is practically just NEXRAD Level 2 data, which is provided to the public for free (do the research - the NWS has made it available in different ways and there’s different methods of viewing it, at least on a PC), it just doesn’t feel right, even with the data being redistributed by RadarScope.\n\nI will still use RadarScope because I already spent the $10, and what is included in the base app is quality \u0026 convenient.

And that your able to change the color of the warning so like if you want a blue outline for a confirmed tornado on the the ground or a pink outline for a tornado emergency or a different color for a svr thunderstorm warning if you want if that makes sense.

Stick with your news channel weather app. You need to have a little more than a basic understanding of weather and at least some understanding of basic level atmospheric sciences to be able to use this app to its full potential. The features of RadarScope are unmatched. I can watch broad rotation turn to tight rotation then pull up the correlation coefficient view and see what is happening.

That’s not radarscopes fault it’s the fault of the user. Radars are tools used by professionals, amateurs and ordinary people, the radar doesn’t lie on what it sees. If a radar isn’t updating it’s possible the NWS location (which is where the ap gets the data from) has issues, that’s not the apps fault. Sure the ap isn’t perfect but it’s hands down, it’s  the best radar available on a phone or iPad. No other can even scratch the surface of what radarscope provides.

meteorologists that allows you view NEXRAD Level 3 and super-resolution radar data along with tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine and snow squall warnings, and predicted storm tracks issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. It can display the latest reflectivity, velocity, dual-polarization, and other products from any NEXRAD or TDWR radar site in the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, Korea, and Okinawa, as well as data from Environment Canada, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Finnish Meteorological Institute, and German Weather Service radars. These aren't smoothed images, this is native radar data rendered in its original radial format for a high level of detail. \n\nWhether you are scanning reflectivity for a mesocyclone's tell-tale hook echo, trying to pinpoint the landfall of a hurricane's eye wall, or looking for small features like velocity couplets in the storm relative radial velocity product, RadarScope gives you the power to view true radial weather radar data.\n\nRadarScope displays tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine, and snow squall warnings issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. You can browse the list of active warnings, select a warning to view the details, and even zoom to the selected warning on the map.\n\nPan and zoom around the map using your Siri Remote. Select one of the 307 different radars in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Korea, Puerto Rico, Guam, or Okinawa. Tap the play button to download and animate over recent images. Display the names of over 25,000 cities and towns on the map as you zoom and scroll.\n\nMeanwhile, RadarScope will retrieve and display updated data automatically and intelligently (approximately every 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the radar scan strategy). \n\nYou can display data from NOAA's public access web site, our optional WDT feed (the default), or your AllisonHouse subscriber account. Spotter Network members can view the locations of other spotters.\n\nYou can display radar data from our servers, NOAA's public access web site, or your Allison House subscriber account.\n\nRadarScope Pro is an optional auto-renewing subscription with two different tiers to choose from.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier One is an annual subscription that provides access to real-time lightning data in the U.S. and Canada that animates along with the radar loop and up to 30 frames of radar data, including extended loops of super-resolution data. Tier One subscribers can also access a data interrogation tool to quickly determine data values for specific radar pixels and an optional dual-pane mode for viewing two radar products side-by-side.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier Two is an annual or monthly subscription that combines all the features in Tier One with more advanced features, including SPC outlooks, mesoscale discussions, local storm reports, hail size and probability contours, and azimuthal shear contours in the U.S., a 30-day archive of all radar products, and the ability to use subscription features across multiple platforms.\n\nIf you choose to buy the RadarScope Pro subscription, it will charged to your iTunes account. The subscription will be auto-renewed within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price you originally paid. Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal disabled via your iTunes Account Settings after the purchase. Once purchased, the subscription cannot be cancelled during the active subscription period.\n\nDTN is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.

meteorologists that allows you view NEXRAD Level 3 and super-resolution radar data along with tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine and snow squall warnings, and predicted storm tracks issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. It can display the latest reflectivity, velocity, dual-polarization, and other products from any NEXRAD or TDWR radar site in the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, Korea, and Okinawa, as well as data from Environment Canada, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Finnish Meteorological Institute, and German Weather Service radars. These aren't smoothed images, this is native radar data rendered in its original radial format for a high level of detail. \n\nWhether you are scanning reflectivity for a mesocyclone's tell-tale hook echo, trying to pinpoint the landfall of a hurricane's eye wall, or looking for small features like velocity couplets in the storm relative radial velocity product, RadarScope gives you the power to view true radial weather radar data.\n\nRadarScope displays tornado, severe thunderstorm, flash flood, special marine, and snow squall warnings issued by the U.S. National Weather Service. You can browse the list of active warnings, select a warning to view the details, and even zoom to the selected warning on the map.\n\nPinch or stretch to zoom in and out. Drag your finger around the map to scroll. Tap the radar sweep button in the toolbar to switch radars. Select one of the 289 different radars in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Korea, Puerto Rico, Guam, or Okinawa. Plot your current location by tapping the location button and optionally report it to the Spotter Network. Tap the play button to download and animate over recent images. Display the names of over 25,000 cities and towns on the map as you zoom and scroll. Tap and hold the color legend to see the data values. \n\nMeanwhile, RadarScope will retrieve and display updated data automatically and intelligently (approximately every 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the radar scan strategy). \n\nYou can display radar data from our servers, NOAA's public access web site, or your Allison House subscriber account. Spotter Network members can report their location and view the locations of other spotters.\n\nRadarScope Pro is an optional auto-renewing subscription with two different tiers to choose from.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier One is an annual subscription that provides access to real-time lightning data in the U.S. and Canada that animates along with the radar loop and up to 30 frames of radar data, including extended loops of super-resolution data. Tier One subscribers can also access a data interrogation tool to quickly determine data values for specific radar pixels and an optional dual-pane mode for viewing two radar products side-by-side.\n\nRadarScope Pro Tier Two is an annual or monthly subscription that combines all the features in Tier One with more advanced features, including SPC outlooks, mesoscale discussions, local storm reports, hail size and probability contours, and azimuthal shear contours in the U.S., a 30-day archive of all radar products, and the ability to use subscription features across multiple platforms.\n\nIf you choose to buy the RadarScope Pro subscription, it will charged to your iTunes account. The subscription will be auto-renewed within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price you originally paid. Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal disabled via your iTunes Account Settings after the purchase. Once purchased, the subscription cannot be cancelled during the active subscription period.\n\nDTN is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.
