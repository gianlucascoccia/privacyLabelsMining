        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have extremely bad anxiety when I was younger my husband was injured and died after a few weeks later and I never sought help 🆘from a Professional. We had three children, all boys and I felt the need to find a father to give the boys guidance, 10 yrs. Later I had a daughter which was my desire and that relationship didn&#39;t work. I later started investing all my time in the kids, which led me down a dark path I got to a point I questioned everything they did who they hung out with, who they dated an where they would go, and so forth. It got to a point where I was becoming everyone’s mom and everyone’s everything until  I was asked to please leave people alone. I left myself out and my stress levels and my anxiety levels kept rising higher until I got to this point where I&#39;m now. <br />So fast forward today I’ve had four strokes in the past three weeks which three we’re considered mild and one was not that bad but it was a bad stroke it left me walking a little funny and weak in my strength and gate are not so good I&#39;m functioning on low levels. The only way I can sleep is that I listen to this app!!! It relaxes me immediately, puts me to rest so it does work greatly for me and I appreciate you thank you so much.<br />Denise from Washington, DC.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Our family has enjoyed the prayer initiators built on scripture, and a ome of the Bible readings are good.  But, for the $99 price, I don’t find it worth it.  And, if you are not careful, you can miss the fact that you are being charged the $99 when you download the app - they do not make it clear when you try it out.  There is a lot of variety in the app but a lot of it I find not useful.  Most of the things that I find useful can be accessed more affordably, or for free, elsewhere.  Some of the Bible story versions drift too far from scripture, some of the teachers aren’t Biblical and in at least one case a Unitarian Universalist, and some of the voices that read stories are not pleasing to the ear for our family.  While we do like some content, I don’t like paying this high of a fee for some things I disagree with, and this many things that I don’t find useful.  It’s the danger of trying to build a product that has something for everybody, but turns out to have too little for those paying the price.  At a significantly lower price, the cost-benefit trade could become positive.  But, that is just my experience.<br /><br />Also, make sure to read the Privacy Policy carefully on this app.  You are agreeing to have your name, phone number, location, device ID, device access history, and many other pieces of information about you sold to third parties if you use this app.  We’ve seen a marked increase in marketing calls since using it.</p>

We had three children, all boys and I felt the need to find a father to give the boys guidance, 10 yrs. Later I had a daughter which was my desire and that relationship didn't work. I later started investing all my time in the kids, which led me down a dark path I got to a point I questioned everything they did who they hung out with, who they dated an where they would go, and so forth. It got to a point where I was becoming everyone’s mom and everyone’s everything until  I was asked to please leave people alone. I left myself out and my stress levels and my anxiety levels kept rising higher until I got to this point where I'm now. \nSo fast forward today I’ve had four strokes in the past three weeks which three we’re considered mild and one was not that bad but it was a bad stroke it left me walking a little funny and weak in my strength and gate are not so good I'm functioning on low levels.

But, for the $99 price, I don’t find it worth it.  And, if you are not careful, you can miss the fact that you are being charged the $99 when you download the app - they do not make it clear when you try it out.  There is a lot of variety in the app but a lot of it I find not useful.  Most of the things that I find useful can be accessed more affordably, or for free, elsewhere.  Some of the Bible story versions drift too far from scripture, some of the teachers aren’t Biblical and in at least one case a Unitarian Universalist, and some of the voices that read stories are not pleasing to the ear for our family.  While we do like some content, I don’t like paying this high of a fee for some things I disagree with, and this many things that I don’t find useful.  It’s the danger of trying to build a product that has something for everybody, but turns out to have too little for those paying the price.  At a significantly lower price, the cost-benefit trade could become positive.  But, that is just my experience.\n\nAlso, make sure to read the Privacy Policy carefully on this app.  You are agreeing to have your name, phone number, location, device ID, device access history, and many other pieces of information about you sold to third parties if you use this app.  We’ve seen a marked increase in marketing calls since using it.","title":"Some nice features, but expensive","userName":"JesusCaresForYou"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7321178881","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-05-10T11:40:59Z","developerResponse":{"id":22341979,"body":"MuenchnerKindl.

It really makes me giving in my time with god more. I just have 2 suggestion based in my on experience. I wish the Bible language a NIV version because some of the Bible Verses that come up I don’t understand at all. It should more for the average person like me. The prayers are also focused more on church leaders then a just plain little person like me. I wished it would deal more if every day problems of an average person. And I don’t like the comparison with others on how many days in a row you pray. I understand it’s suppose to help you stay on it but it makes me feel like I need to keep up with others instead of focusing on my relationship with God! Sometimes I miss to press the button continue and then my streak is gone and it makes me feel bad even though I know it should not matter. These are just my opinions and suggestions. I do love the app and it has help me to further my relationship with God! Yes still having issues with the language KJV. Most of the time I don’t understand the verse at all. And still don’t like the streak version. At least don’t have the continue button. I am in a prayer state of mind and just close the app without hitting the continue button. If you don’t hit it you loose your streak. For those reasons I changed It to 4 stars.\nReally other than that I still enjoy the app.","title":"Love the app","userName":"MuenchnerKindl"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6013976251","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-05-30T15:05:32Z","developerResponse":{"id":15653927,"body":"Thank you for your kind feedback,gclifton78.

My kids and I use the pray app every evening, like clockwork without 1 day missed since January 1, 2020.  We love watching our streaks grow bigger in number everyday, however, if we forget to tap the continue button (now a heart), it starts you all over again.  Sooo disheartening that it does that.  Its happened to us 4 times now and to prevent my kids from giving up on our nightly ritual, we just say we know our streaks are higher in our hearts.  I would absolutely give this 5 stars and then some of this issue is fixed. \n\n                        ***UPDATE***\nAfter my initial review, the developers reached out so quick, I was shocked!  They fixed my streak issue by the next morning!  I have never had a developer reach out that fast and actually fix an issue.  It goes to show that they actually do care about the success of the app and the convenience it provides for its users.  Great team, AWESOME app, and overly happy customer here!  Also I have to say, the prayers following the scripture on the app seem to hit home a lot of the time.  You know, like it was somehow meant for you.  At the very least, give this app a go.

There’s so much more to say about the Pray App, but I’ll just say it this way - I’m wonderfully hooked! This was well thought through, and it was developed especially for people like me as I like listening over and over and over again. It’s absolutely marvelous, and it makes me joyfully happy.

I have suffered depression from the young age of 10. I am unable to take any medication for it, making it even more difficult to manage. With my Bible I can read and feed on His Word. As I become older it is now too heavy to carry. Physically impossible to get to a church. With the technology we have today I can have a positive experience to soothing voices, music, and videos through this app feeding my spirit, heart, soul, and inner-man without the distractions of other people’s judgmental eyes for my old outdated and poorly fitting clothes. They weren’t always that way. Due to health issues I’m now on a fixed income and have lost weight. Paying for tailoring would be nice, but money ill spent. We live in such a worldly society of “accumulation” right now. When God calls us simply to come along side and love others as he loved us. I can love many, more than if I went to a local church and praise Him anytime of the day or night simply by opening the app. What a treasure and what a wonderful treat to lift my heart up, out, and away from the opposing enemy!","title":"Praise to Our Triune God (Father,Son\u0026Holy Spirit)","userName":"1956SFE"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6468062081","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-25T19:34:39Z","developerResponse":{"id":16954636,"body":"Wanderingstar60697.

I can read along with the verse and bow my head and close my eyes for the prayer. I also enjoy the many other features included. The quality of the app and various categories motivates me to practice prayer and bible study . This is so helpful since I travel for my work and have an irregular schedule.                 After using the app for a while there are only two things I wish for- First add James Earl Jones reading the Old Testament so we have the complete bible . He has such a wonderful voice. Second- a continue listening section has been added which is great . Instead of it showing the last subject and all of that subjects following episodes , I wish it would show the last episode of each program I have listened to. For instance now if a Bedtime Stories episode is the last I have listened to it shows that and the following episodes of Bedtime Stories. I would like it to show the last episode of Bedtime Stories, the last episode of Bible Sagas, the last episode of JEJ New Testament that I listened to.
