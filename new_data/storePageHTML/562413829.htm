    UX should be improved in mobile app

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>- When you go my courses tab and browse one of your purchased courses in mobile app, there is no link to go to the author profile for looking his/her other courses. You basically need to search instructor name in search section to find his/her other courses. Waste of time. This problem can be solved very easy.  In purchased courses,  a simple button/link which goes instructor profile can be put in the “more” section. Then I can easily look my instructors other courses and enroll them if I like it. <br /><br />- When you look for a new course, you can see the curriculum in extendable way. Tree structure in other words. When you click the “+” sign, you can see the content of the section. This is perfect. If there is a lot of section, it says after showing some section, “There is 19 more section”. 19 is trivial, this number depends on the course. Anyway, when you click this link to see whole section, there is no tree view any more. No “+” sign to extend section content. Which means there is a very big table of contents page. You have to scroll down and up to see everything. It is waste of time. You can implement a tree view after I click to see whole section. Then If I curious about content of the one section, I can click the “+” sign and see the content. You also can add “extend/collapse all section” option. This is more user friendly. <br /><br />Thanks!</p>

    Mostly Great - Has issues with Bluetooth

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The content on Udemy is first class, so that part is 5 star.  So this review is just for the iPhone app.  You can easily play content, and download to play off line, that is very good.  It has a couple of quirks, though, and one deficiency.<br />Quirk 1:  you can’t play/pause using Bluetooth.  I’ll qualify that to say that you can play, but not pause.  I tested with Apple AirPods and Bose Quiet Comfort and neither could pause.  This is inconvenient, because sometimes I’ll have my phone plugged in and will be listening to a lecture and I have to walk over to the phone to pause.<br />Quirk 2:  The “my courses” section will sometimes just appear empty.  If I close &amp; reopen the app, it refreshes and I see my courses.  I think the app doesn’t gracefully handle being connected/disconnected from Internet access and then doesn’t properly display content.<br />Deficiency:  You can’t bookmark or see bookmarks in the app.  These exist in a full Internet browser, and are very useful.  I often use my phone for watching lectures though so I can multitask when the lecture doesn’t require a hands on activity - then I go back to my laptop when needed.   I would like for the app to have bookmarks that are synced to Udemy so that they appear for me everywhere.</p>

    Love Udemy....but not the app.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I absolutely love Udemy. I’m beginning to hate the app. They apparently once had an app for Apple TV but decided to abort it once apple developed the ability to airplay or cast your videos to the Apple TV from the iPhone. However, you can only cast from an iOS device and not a computer. Annoying, but that part isn’t necessarily Udemy’s fault. Udemy has a feature where you can increase the playback speed of the video. It’s great for instructors who talk slowly or for a lesson you might already be pretty familiar with but only want to brush up on. Well, when you increase this playback speed and then cast to your Apple TV, you may or may not have audio. More likely you won’t. I have to continually hit pause, play, pause, play, pause, play until the audio finally kicks in. I have to do this for each lecture. Additionally, if you pause a lecture for more than a few seconds, the Udemy app decides to start playing again on it’s own, but the real fun part is that it doesn’t start playing from where you paused, it jumps to an entirely new lecture. Need to go to the bathroom? Don’t pause it! Unless you want to spend the next 15 minutes trying to figure out where you actually left off. These issues are quite annoying and really affect the productivity of the learning process.</p>

How Do We Keep Your Information Secure?\n\nUdemy takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of, sensitive data that You share and We collect and store. These security measures may include practices such as keeping Your sensitive data on a secured server behind a firewall, transmitting sensitive information (such as a credit card number) entered on Our Services using secure socket layer technology (SSL), internal reviews of Our data collection practices and platforms, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where We store Your information. Unfortunately, however, no system can be 100% secured, and We cannot guarantee that communications between You and Udemy, the Services, or any information provided to Us in connection with the information We collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of User information at any time. Your password is an important component of Our security system.

Our Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Automated Information Collection\n\nLike many websites and app providers, Udemy (and/or service providers acting on Our behalf, such as Google Analytics and/or our third party advertisers) uses server log files and automated data collection tools, such as cookies, tags, scripts and web beacons (collectively, \"Data Collection Tools\") when You access and use our Services. In some cases, We tie the information gathered by these means to our customers' personally identifiable information.

Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.

Promotions\nWe may share Your information in connection with any promotion You enter on or through the Services, as necessary to administer, market, sponsor, or fulfill the promotion or as required by applicable laws, rules or regulations (for example, to provide winners' lists or make required filings as appropriate) or in accordance with the applicable rules of the promotion/sweepstakes You enter.\n\n5.

Advertising of Third Party Products/Services\nWhile we do not currently offer advertising on the Services, if we do offer advertising in the future, we may use and share with third party advertisers (and other third parties) certain Technical Information and/or Aggregate Information to show general demographic and preference information among our Users. We may also allow advertisers to collect Technical Information or Aggregate Information, which they may share with Us, through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons.

To learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising for participating ad networks, You can visit the Network Advertising Initiative website. If You are located in the European Union and would like to opt- out, please visit, this page . Please note this does not opt You out of being served ads.

How Do We Keep Your Information Secure?\n\nUdemy takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of, sensitive data that You share and We collect and store. These security measures may include practices such as keeping Your sensitive data on a secured server behind a firewall, transmitting sensitive information (such as a credit card number) entered on Our Services using secure socket layer technology (SSL), internal reviews of Our data collection practices and platforms, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where We store Your information. Unfortunately, however, no system can be 100% secured, and We cannot guarantee that communications between You and Udemy, the Services, or any information provided to Us in connection with the information We collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of User information at any time. Your password is an important component of Our security system. As such, it is Your responsibility to protect it. Do not share Your password with any third parties. If Your password has been compromised for any reason, You should change it immediately and contact support@udemy.com with any concerns.\n\n10.

How We Respond to Do-Not-Track Signals\n\nBecause consumers are often unaware that their do-not- track beacons are active, do-not-track does not frequently reflect the actual preferences of Our Users. Accordingly, Udemy does not respond to the federal do-not- track signal. If You would like to receive no promotional communication from Udemy, You are free to follow the procedure described in the previous section to unsubscribe.\n\n12.

You basically need to search instructor name in search section to find his/her other courses. Waste of time. This problem can be solved very easy.  In purchased courses,  a simple button/link which goes instructor profile can be put in the “more” section. Then I can easily look my instructors other courses and enroll them if I like it. \n\n- When you look for a new course, you can see the curriculum in extendable way. Tree structure in other words. When you click the “+” sign, you can see the content of the section. This is perfect. If there is a lot of section, it says after showing some section, “There is 19 more section”. 19 is trivial, this number depends on the course. Anyway, when you click this link to see whole section, there is no tree view any more. No “+” sign to extend section content. Which means there is a very big table of contents page. You have to scroll down and up to see everything. It is waste of time. You can implement a tree view after I click to see whole section. Then If I curious about content of the one section, I can click the “+” sign and see the content. You also can add “extend/collapse all section” option. This is more user friendly. \n\nThanks!","title":"UX should be improved in mobile app","userName":"SolveThisNeedUpdate"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5370646964","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-01-07T03:59:52Z","rating":3,"review":"The content on Udemy is first class, so that part is 5 star.  So this review is just for the iPhone app.  You can easily play content, and download to play off line, that is very good.  It has a couple of quirks, though, and one deficiency.\nQuirk 1:  you can’t play/pause using Bluetooth.  I’ll qualify that to say that you can play, but not pause.  I tested with Apple AirPods and Bose Quiet Comfort and neither could pause.  This is inconvenient, because sometimes I’ll have my phone plugged in and will be listening to a lecture and I have to walk over to the phone to pause.\nQuirk 2:  The “my courses” section will sometimes just appear empty.  If I close \u0026 reopen the app, it refreshes and I see my courses.  I think the app doesn’t gracefully handle being connected/disconnected from Internet access and then doesn’t properly display content.\nDeficiency:  You can’t bookmark or see bookmarks in the app.  These exist in a full Internet browser, and are very useful.  I often use my phone for watching lectures though so I can multitask when the lecture doesn’t require a hands on activity - then I go back to my laptop when needed.   I would like for the app to have bookmarks that are synced to Udemy so that they appear for me everywhere.","title":"Mostly Great - Has issues with Bluetooth","userName":"Nsxlane"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7306077758","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-05-06T21:03:23Z","rating":2,"review":"I absolutely love Udemy. I’m beginning to hate the app. They apparently once had an app for Apple TV but decided to abort it once apple developed the ability to airplay or cast your videos to the Apple TV from the iPhone. However, you can only cast from an iOS device and not a computer. Annoying, but that part isn’t necessarily Udemy’s fault. Udemy has a feature where you can increase the playback speed of the video. It’s great for instructors who talk slowly or for a lesson you might already be pretty familiar with but only want to brush up on. Well, when you increase this playback speed and then cast to your Apple TV, you may or may not have audio. More likely you won’t. I have to continually hit pause, play, pause, play, pause, play until the audio finally kicks in. I have to do this for each lecture. Additionally, if you pause a lecture for more than a few seconds, the Udemy app decides to start playing again on it’s own, but the real fun part is that it doesn’t start playing from where you paused, it jumps to an entirely new lecture. Need to go to the bathroom? Don’t pause it! Unless you want to spend the next 15 minutes trying to figure out where you actually left off. These issues are quite annoying and really affect the productivity of the learning process.","title":"Love Udemy....but not the app.","userName":"dbrock1958"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3786451080","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-02-18T22:04:47Z","developerResponse":{"id":7408042,"body":"Hi there, we sincerely apologize for the downloading and streaming issue.

I stream video from the usual places Netflix etc. without issue in HD but Udemy software is constantly buffering and won’t load making it impossible to use their courses. And I have tried to download courses to the mobile app multiple times. on three different devices, Over different Wi-Fi’s and on phone data plan. I’ve tried downloading different courses to mobile device without success, downloads will usually complete around halfway to 3/4 and then stop and never finished downloading the rest of the way. Since streaming capabilities are clearly not up to par, they should make downloading an option to desktop, otherwise they should notify people before purchasing that you’re only allowed to “rent” their courses since if I cannot download it I technically don’t own it. It’s truly unfortunate because they offer many great courses at very reasonable prices.

The app has lots of rendering issues switching from the vertical to the horizontal view. Today, the list of sections for the AWS CPP exam are being rendered incorrectly. Video clips actually appear under the wrong section in both views. I’m uncertain how to fix this. I checked and I am on the latest version and there are no pending bug fixes for this behavior that I can see. Also, pausing the app has been a problem since I started using it last Summer for training. If I pause it and come back after an hour or so, I always have to reboot the app. Otherwise it sits there unresponsive to any request. I often resort to just using the Udemy website for my phone or iPad because the app is that poor. I have found the desktop version of the site with my old Dell laptop running Ubuntu Chrome has actually been best. I wish that was not the case because I would like to use the iOS app with my phone and AirPods as I work around the house on mindless things like mowing grass or cleaning. Please fix UI issues for a better UX folks because I really enjoy your courses.

There is nothing wrong with the Udemy service, if you use it online on a desktop computer. This app can play the courses, but apparently is unable to pause for longer than a few seconds without completely disrupting the stream. This means that if you have to pause a lecture to catch up or just take a break, you will need to take the video out of full-screen mode, minimize it and then re-open it. After doing this 100 times, it’s clear this app is not ready for prime-time. I have purchased over 20 courses through Udemy, any now won’t be able to complete them because of this serious design flaw. Pay attention to the negative reviews. Do NOT sign up for a Udemy course or engage in any of their other services if you will be needing to access them via a mobile device. It is clear this is not the only bug, but it’s a big enough problem that one can only wonder how it slipped by quality control. The answer is simple: the developer team doesn’t test these apps on the devices they are designed for. It’s a shame, because Udemy would double or even triple their business profits if there were fully functional mobile options. As of the time of this review, this is not the case.","title":"Avoid Udemy courses if you will need mobile access","userName":"VizMind"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6986579370","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-12T20:30:01Z","rating":1,"review":"The app used to work fine. I could download videos and press play, they would just play in the background no problem. Now the app constantly gives me the alert Low memory even when playing downloaded videos. I deleted the app and reinstalled and still have the same problem. I have over 2 GB of free memory on my phone and no other apps running and this still happens. I can’t control which part of the video I want to watch from Lock Screen, the slider is disabled now even though it worked before. Also because of the low memory error that is incorrect it cannot keep playing on to the next video. So when I want to play videos in the background I have to: Unlock my phone, open the app, press ok on the low memory error, click to the course I was just in, click the next video, click okay AGAIN on the low memory error that pops up immediately, turn off my phone (which causes the video to pause even though play on background is on) press play then press play a second time because the first time changes the icon to the pause icon but doesn’t actually unpause the video.

And perhaps some of the UI/UX courses. App is very buggy. Crashes randomly. Screen would rotate 180 degrees (up side down) when you play the preview videos. Have to rotate device back and forth to “fix” the the issue. Sometimes the next video in the course would play automatically.  Other times, not. Need to restart app to restore functionality sometimes. Would also like to see it updated to support newer devices such as the 2018 iPad Pro I am using.  Would also like to see some of the functionalities such as the playback speed and captioning options made more easily accessible (e.g.  directly on the screen overlay along with the playback buttons).  I believe these functions are used often enough given the nature of the contents (i.e.  training courses) that they deserve to be in a more accessible location rather than behind another menu. I would even suggest some gesture controls for skipping backwards and forwards instead making the user try to push tiny buttons that are a miss half the time.","title":"Bugs, Bugs and more Bugs","userName":"Xohmer"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4571069919","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-08-05T04:22:19Z","developerResponse":{"id":10023039,"body":"Hi there, thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Very annoying to open a course and have a random video immediately start playing. I transition between the app and desktop site and progress has a hard time syncing so, no, I don’t want to pick up where you think I left off. Honestly, I’d like to read the title of the lecture before jumping in or even may want to rewatch the last one to get my bearings. I’d like to choose which lecture I want to watch next as nearly all courses I watch have modules that can be watched out of order. This is basic UX. Clicking on a course should take me to a course. If I want to watch a vid, I’ll click on the vid or a play button. I don’t need you to unintuitively skip steps for me. There is no way to check your progress without auto playing a lecture. \n\nHave also had issues recently where the majority of my lectures did’t load over WiFi, and numbering was completely off.
