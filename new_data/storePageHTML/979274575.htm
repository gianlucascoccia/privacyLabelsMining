Also includes a banner when highlighting comments to other participants.<br />- Two new icons! The first is a terrific icon named Dr. Spaceman by Jeff Broderick. The second is a beautiful icon named N.E.L.S.O.N. by Gavin Nelson. Together the two icons make an excellent pair. :)<br />- Fixed a crash that could occur on Apple silicon Macs<br />- Fixed an issue with keyboard navigation on iPad<br /><br />- Christian</p>

    Absolutely Stellar App, Developer is 🔥

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Apollo is by far the most-used app on my phone (and now I have the ScreenTime reports to prove it). It is orders of magnitude better than the “official” reddit app and is superior in every way. It is fast and smooth and packed with features. I especially love that I can pick the theme I want, change the icon, and remove ads! The thing I hated most about the official app was the ads that were disguised as legitimate posts and with Apollo that’s all gone!<br /><br />I bought the Pro upgrade months ago to gain access to additional features and it was one of the few in-app purchases I have never regretted or felt like wasn’t worth the cost. Today the developer released an update adding a bunch of new features that require a very reasonable (seems underpriced to be honest) monthly subscription, and like a true bro he has the option to unlock it for life with a onetime purchase! I hate monthly and even yearly subscriptions so I especially appreciated this option. <br /><br />All that by itself should convince you that this app is worth it, but the thing that really seals the deal is the developer. He is amazing. Super active with feedback and very open in his communication about the status of the app’s development and requested features.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Apollo is simply perfect, and you don’t really realize how many features you wanted in a Reddit app until you use Apollo. I used RiF for years and thought I really liked it, and when I made the switch to iOS about a year ago I was annoyed that I had to give it up. I tried 3 different apps on iOS before finally giving Apollo a shot, and that was that. It’s heaven compared to all of its competitors. <br /><br />Swipe to upvote/downvote/save/reply along with haptic feedback is so convenient to use that I find myself engaging in comments far more than I did previously (there’s something so satisfying about that little “bzzt”). The ability to map your own gestures for different actions within the app is awesome too. On top of all that, it’s just a beautiful, sleek looking app that was clearly designed by someone who knows their stuff when it comes to UX. <br /><br />Apollo also has its own subreddit, and Christian the sole developer is very active in it and is constantly adding features requested there. He’s a solid dude. Do yourself a favor and try it even if you think you love your current app. I can promise that you won’t regret it.</p>

    Fantastic Reddit client for iPhone
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>From first use, this app is a joy to use. It integrates incredibly well with the rest of iOS. The default settings are mostly intuitive (especially for first time users) and for those places where the app doesn’t do what you expect, the available options are extensive.<br /><br />What prompted me to write this review was actually a feature of the Ultra subscription (also available as a one time purchase). I’d put off purchasing Ultra for a while, as the biggest draw to me was the message/reply notifications but I still used Narwhal for that. I recently subscribed to support the developer, and got my first notification. It’s great, it feels like an iMessage notification with a quick reply sheet opening up so I can respond with the easy option to open the full app as well.<br /><br />The one limitation I encounter with this app is the iPad interface. It is not as well thought out as the iPhone interface; it’s basically a scaled up version of the iPhone interface. But as an iPhone app, this is the best Reddit client I’ve used (I even prefer it over the old and new website on a “real” computer).</p>

Also includes a banner when highlighting comments to other participants.\n- Two new icons! The first is a terrific icon named Dr. Spaceman by Jeff Broderick. The second is a beautiful icon named N.E.L.S.O.N. by Gavin Nelson.

First off, some issues around an occasional GIF playing weirdly should be fixed now (such as starting/restarting from a weird point, or not playing at all).\n\nAlso fixes some issues around theming, specifically the search bar could occasionally look weird against the top navigation bar. Further, there were reports of Apollo occasionally not properly switching between light and dark modes, that should be fixed too.\n\nFurther, an issue around uploading images to Imgur should now be fixed!\n\nLastly fixed an issue around GIFs sometimes starting to play after you paused them and unmuted the video, and a somewhat related issue around pressing the volume buttons on your iOS device not turning the sound on properly for a video.\n\nOh, and if you missed it in the last bug fix update, for Face ID / Touch ID locking Apollo, you can now set a timer delay so it optionally won’t activate immediately!\n\nAs always if you’re having any other issues please reach out!

Here’s some of the really cool things I've been working on this summer, focused around the new iOS 15 update. (Apollo’s always gotta have the latest and great, right?) There’s a lot of awesome features and fixes in this update that I think you're going to love, so read on!\n\nMORE WIDGETS\n\nWidgets are too much fun, so I couldn’t stop there. iPadOS 15 introduced the absolutely gargantuan “Extra Large Widgets” and of course I wanted to take advantage of that with Apollo. So now you have FOUR new choices there for widgets, all being hit with whatever the opposite of a shrink ray is. You have an enormous photo widget that just oozes details from your favorite subreddits, as well as a variant that shows photos at a time in a beautiful gallery look.

In the meantime, here's a quality of life update that adds and fixes some nice things.\n\n- New YouTube player! This update features a new YouTube player, since the old one could be a wee bit fragile at times, the new one is super-powerful, and uses the system video player so you'll feel right at home on iOS, and still with video-scrubbing capabilities like you know and love. \n- Twitter functionality restored! There was a small bug a little while back around tweets showing inline in Apollo, so I took the time to rewrite the engine for Apollo's tweet previews, and that's now live in this version, so everything should work just lickety-split!\n- New icon! There's a brand new Ultra icon by Alfrey Davilla, lovingly called Gorilla Gus. I hope you love Gorilla Gus as much as I do. He's a very kind-hearted gorilla.\n- Known issues: there's a small bug around the new YouTube player and Low Power Mode being active, so it'll kick you off to the web browser while Low Power Mode is active.

(Reminder: Apollo Ultra includes all of them!) See if you can find them all! A bunch of them are homages to some of my favorite video content creators.\n- Apollo now supports Family Sharing across all in-app purchases and subscriptions, so if you have a family member wanting to get in on the Apollo goodness they easily can now!\n- Added ability to \"follow\" users you find interesting, just like a subreddit!\n- Added back option to open Reddit links on your clipboard in Apollo. It's off by default but you can enable it in Settings \u003e General\n- Improved photo uploading in private messages\n- Added a suspicious looking text face to list of Text Faces in the comment composer\n- Added option to hide usernames in Share as Image (sometimes subreddits ask you to hide them when sharing, or sometimes people just have weird usernames)\n- Also in Share as Image you can now share link posts and it'll include the cute little thumbnail and everything!\n- Includes \"Privacy Nutritional Label\" information! Apollo is a good privacy citizen!\n- Added support for Reddit's new \"awarder and awardee\" karma that you get for giving and receiving awards.

Simply go to the subreddit of your choosing, and you can choose from a list of customizable flairs!\n- Tap on the long flair to bring up a window that expands it fully!\n- If the subreddit lets users tag their posts with individual flairs, you can now simply tap on that flair and Apollo will show you all the other posts in the subreddit that have been tagged with that same flair.\n- 5 new icons, the first three are Ultra icons, all made by the incredibly talented designer, Matthew Skiles! Next, we have a beautiful new icon representing the trans pride flag (originally by Monica Helms), which came out awesome! And our incredible community designer, FutureIncident, created the Japanese-inspired Apollo-san icon!\n- Detect if the language of a comment or post is different than the language of your iOS device, and if so, offer to quickly translate it so you can understand the conversation! \n- New auto-completing window that makes it super fast to search and add subreddits.\n- Two handy new additions to collapsing comments in Apollo. The first, Apollo will show you at a glance how many comments are in the collapsed conversation. Second, if you collapse a bunch of comments, and then come back to that same comment section later, Apollo will now remember which comments you had collapsed, and keep them collapsed for you!\n\nThank you so much!

It is orders of magnitude better than the “official” reddit app and is superior in every way. It is fast and smooth and packed with features. I especially love that I can pick the theme I want, change the icon, and remove ads! The thing I hated most about the official app was the ads that were disguised as legitimate posts and with Apollo that’s all gone!\n\nI bought the Pro upgrade months ago to gain access to additional features and it was one of the few in-app purchases I have never regretted or felt like wasn’t worth the cost. Today the developer released an update adding a bunch of new features that require a very reasonable (seems underpriced to be honest) monthly subscription, and like a true bro he has the option to unlock it for life with a onetime purchase! I hate monthly and even yearly subscriptions so I especially appreciated this option. \n\nAll that by itself should convince you that this app is worth it, but the thing that really seals the deal is the developer. He is amazing. Super active with feedback and very open in his communication about the status of the app’s development and requested features.","title":"Absolutely Stellar App, Developer is 🔥","userName":"Malefic11677"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5043435015","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-10-28T23:40:06Z","rating":5,"review":"Apollo is simply perfect, and you don’t really realize how many features you wanted in a Reddit app until you use Apollo. I used RiF for years and thought I really liked it, and when I made the switch to iOS about a year ago I was annoyed that I had to give it up. I tried 3 different apps on iOS before finally giving Apollo a shot, and that was that. It’s heaven compared to all of its competitors. \n\nSwipe to upvote/downvote/save/reply along with haptic feedback is so convenient to use that I find myself engaging in comments far more than I did previously (there’s something so satisfying about that little “bzzt”). The ability to map your own gestures for different actions within the app is awesome too. On top of all that, it’s just a beautiful, sleek looking app that was clearly designed by someone who knows their stuff when it comes to UX. \n\nApollo also has its own subreddit, and Christian the sole developer is very active in it and is constantly adding features requested there. He’s a solid dude. Do yourself a favor and try it even if you think you love your current app. I can promise that you won’t regret it.","title":"The best Reddit app there is, no doubt about it.","userName":"notgreatbob84"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6034922006","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-04T16:48:17Z","rating":5,"review":"From first use, this app is a joy to use. It integrates incredibly well with the rest of iOS. The default settings are mostly intuitive (especially for first time users) and for those places where the app doesn’t do what you expect, the available options are extensive.\n\nWhat prompted me to write this review was actually a feature of the Ultra subscription (also available as a one time purchase). I’d put off purchasing Ultra for a while, as the biggest draw to me was the message/reply notifications but I still used Narwhal for that. I recently subscribed to support the developer, and got my first notification. It’s great, it feels like an iMessage notification with a quick reply sheet opening up so I can respond with the easy option to open the full app as well.\n\nThe one limitation I encounter with this app is the iPad interface. It is not as well thought out as the iPhone interface; it’s basically a scaled up version of the iPhone interface. But as an iPhone app, this is the best Reddit client I’ve used (I even prefer it over the old and new website on a “real” computer).","title":"Fantastic Reddit client for iPhone","userName":"paxswill"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6627726949","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-11-10T00:59:22Z","rating":5,"review":"When i saw reddit(iphone app), it was confusing, i didnt know how to go to different subbredit(i am not that good at english) and it was complicated, but appolo is much simpler, i can go to different subbs more simply, everything is designed just for ios, overall, ist easy to use. But the problem is that i need to pay for stuff that is one of the reasong people go on reddit, to post, and you make us pay for that, i am still giving this app 5 stars, its amazing, but the need to pay  for posting and notifications is just weird. But one more reason to pay, that made me give this 5 stars, is that is an idie app, and its really nice from him to make this “ios version” of reddit for us to use, that is 50% of the reason why i paid 6.99$ for premium, other 50% is to make posts. And i dont understand how to get awards of coins here, but i dont care about those. So overall, the app is great, i reccommend, but only if you are willing to give at least 4.99$(one time purchase) to be able to post, change icon, etc. But even if you dont, the app is great, it goes with ios.","title":"Its perfect for ios, but...","userName":"Vuk Stajic"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4859845007","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-09-29T13:30:21Z","rating":4,"review":"I love Apollo, I have used it for months. And I paid for the pro and had an ultra subscription as well. The apps beautiful UI that blends well with the rest of iOS. However there are two things that bother me about the app. First, I feel the app adheres too well to the human interface guidelines. The apps hyper-minimalistic look creates a confusing and often buries you in a heap of menus with little to no pointers on what to do. This attempts to be remedied with occasional tips that pop up explaining some of the apps features. But it creates more of an annoyance to returning users or users just wanting to explore. Second, I feel like the app has too many features packed into one app as it attempts to cram casual and experienced browsing with searching and moderating. Features like the search bar are hidden while scrolling to make room for more of the screen, making it somewhat hard to get back up should you want to search in the middle of scrolling. Action sheets also tend to require a lot of scrolling to find a specific action, and some text is hard to select to go to subreddits and user pages.

I only use a fraction of all the features it has to offer and even still it is by far the best Reddit mobile experience I've seen.\n\nHowever, for the past week or so there's been a reoccurring glitch that has been incredibly frustrating. I'm using an iPhone 7 running iOS 11.2.1 for the record. So this usually occurs after I've been using the app for at least 10-15 minutes continuously. I'll be a few dozen posts down through my home page or one specific subreddit and suddenly I'll lose the ability to click on posts. I can scroll through the subreddit, click on the thumbnail, vote, and even use haptic touch or whatever it's called. But I can't click in a way that brings me to the post's \"page\" and thus there's no way I can view more than the top couple comments. The problems seems to fix itself temporarily when I force close the app and come back, but then I lose my place in the subreddit or on my home page.

If you are transitioning from another app, SURE you are going to face a transitional period. It’s been made so customizable and I’ve got it dialed in to what works best for me.

The four new icons have an error when applying (a popup actually comes up to contact the developer if I’m seeing the message, and the issue persists).  There are just a few things missing which will allow me to delete Alien Blue once and for all.  A gallery mode based on the current subreddit, and the ability to use gestures to filter subreddits from r/All are nearly the only things keeping me from permanently switching to Apollo.  Also from a UI perspective, in compact mode, lines to break up posts are probably not necessary, as each post is identical in height, and merely an appropriate amount of white/black space between

This update features a new YouTube player, since the old one could be a wee bit fragile at times, the new one is super-powerful, and uses the system video player so you'll feel right at home on iOS, and still with video-scrubbing capabilities like you know and love. \n- Twitter functionality restored! There was a small bug a little while back around tweets showing inline in Apollo, so I took the time to rewrite the engine for Apollo's tweet previews, and that's now live in this version, so everything should work just lickety-split!\n- New icon! There's a brand new Ultra icon by Alfrey Davilla, lovingly called Gorilla Gus. I hope you love Gorilla Gus as much as I do. He's a very kind-hearted gorilla.\n- Known issues: there's a small bug around the new YouTube player and Low Power Mode being active, so it'll kick you off to the web browser while Low Power Mode is active.

It's off by default but you can enable it in Settings \u003e General\n- Improved photo uploading in private messages\n- Added a suspicious looking text face to list of Text Faces in the comment composer\n- Added option to hide usernames in Share as Image (sometimes subreddits ask you to hide them when sharing, or sometimes people just have weird usernames)\n- Also in Share as Image you can now share link posts and it'll include the cute little thumbnail and everything!\n- Includes \"Privacy Nutritional Label\" information! Apollo is a good privacy citizen!\n- Added support for Reddit's new \"awarder and awardee\" karma that you get for giving and receiving awards. If you tap your/another user's karma header in their profile it will detail it.\n- Added support for Reddit's new \"Snoomoji\". It seems to only be a test in a few subreddits, but you'll be able to see little Reddit style emoji in comments.\n- Apollo now properly displays inline GIFs that Reddit has added to certain subreddits in the same inline way Apollo shows other GIFs in comments\n- Added subscribe and follow options to subreddits and users in the haptic touch context menus!\n- If a comment or post has been edited you can now tap the little pencil icon and it'll show you when the comment was edited\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n- Everyone upvoted a bug with a GIF of a fluffy dog in it so I fixed that bug too. Not going to lie the cute dog distracted me a little but I think it was something to do with GIF progress not updating in crossposts.\n- Fixed bug where you couldn't fully disable \"tap to collapse\", so now you can!\n- Fixed bug where subreddits in subreddit listing in dark mode had slightly lighter background color\n- Fixed some issues with video playback\n- Fixed crash that could occur when downloading some GIFs\n- Fixed background color of inbox boxes in dark mode\n- Fixed occasional crash that could happen with opening videos in media viewer\n- Fixed bug where haptic touch context menus would be reversed for subreddit and user\n- Fixed bug with moderators setting flair where custom flair wouldn't get set\n- Fixed bug where when refreshing your Inbox some messages could randomly disappear for a second or cause the badge count to be incorrect\n- Fixed another crashing bug that could occur with formatting dates (calendrical, not the fruit)\n- Some other tiny bug fixes and tweaks and tidies that make everything just a little bit spiffier\n\nI would have had even *more* features and bug fixes in this update but I've been working around the ham sandwich on the juicy iPad update (no olives), stay tuned for details on that!\n\nAs always, thank you for supporting Apollo and my work and I'll do my best to keep impressing you with awesome things to come! Have a great one!\n\n- Christian","releaseDate":"2021-02-05"},{"versionDisplay":"1.10.5","releaseNotes":"Hey all! I've been hard at work on this update that includes some awesome tweaks and additions, as well as a bunch of bug fixes to some areas you have messaged me about that have been a teensy bit annoying. Read on!\n\n- Two new awesome icons! Getting everything together for this update took a bit of time, so we have two Apollo Ultra icons in one this release: the icons for November AND December. The November icon is an absolutely gorgeous, very happy and cute icon from the incredible Raphael Lopes, I just love how this came out and it makes me smile. For December, something festive is in order, so we have a very tasty gingerbread man rendition (named George) of the Apollo icon by the awesomely talented Qi Sandor (who did the Christmas icon two years ago as well) that will spruce your home screen up for the holiday season and whatever you celebrate\n- Fixed some issues around videos loading improperly or slowly\n- Fixed bug where audio wouldn’t come unmuted sometimes, leaving you awkwardly alone with your thoughts\n- Some fixes around some widget bugs that could occur where the widgets might not load, or potentially show old content. If you run into any further bugs, should me an email with details and include your logs by going to Settings tab \u003e About \u003e Logs\n- Fixed bug with hiding r/All, r/Popular, etc. and added confirmation/explanation dialog\n- On the screen with your list of subreddits the stars and collapse buttons are now spaced further from the right\n- Fixed bug where reading a message sometimes wouldn't mark it as read\n- Fixed bug where “Save to ‘Apollo’ Photo Album” option in Settings \u003e General wasn’t working\n- The video/GIF progress bars now only show if the content is more than a few seconds long\n- Fixed bug where posts could show up as having an error when they really didn’t\n- Fixed bug where crossposted albums weren’t swipable\n- Fixed bug where user comments on their profile could repeat infinitely\n- Fixed bug where sometimes GIFs would just save as images\n- Fixed bug where subreddit icons wouldn’t show in crossposts\n- Fixed bug where custom moderator removal reasons wouldn’t stick\n- Fixed bug where the “successfully posted” banner wouldn’t show up\n- Added option to disable tap to collapse on just comment headers\n- Should look a little sharper on new iOS devices\n- Fixed bug where keyboard could disappear after first key typed in Search tab\n- Added some more bugs for me to find in the future\n\n- Christian","releaseDate":"2020-12-07"},{"versionDisplay":"1.10.4","releaseNotes":"A bunch of bug fixes as well as two new icons, including a spooky Halloween themed icon! Happy Halloween season!\n\n- Apollowe'en icon by the incredibly talented Anthony Piraino from The Iconfactory depicting our loveable hiding under a spooky bedsheet, getting in that Hallowe'en spirit and hoping for some candy, included as this month's Apollo Ultra Icon. But that's not all *infomercial voice*, unlock Apollo Ultra now and you won't get just one new awesome icon, we'll double the offer! TWO ICONS! Also included with Ultra is a new community icon pack called Rimuru, depicting a loveable slime by u/StevSarm.\n- Fixes bug where widgets would show posts from the Popular feed rather than posts from your Home feed.\n- Fixed bug where when scrolling over a comment it was way too easily to accidentally collapse the comment.\n- Fixed bug where when rotating device and then back it could throw you up the feed like a fun but annoying rollercoaster.\n- Fixed bug where audio from a previous video could be randomly duplicated into the next video.\n- Fixed bug where \"comment submitted\" banner would sometimes not show up.\n- Better error states for widgets.\n- Fixes text being cut off when making a cross post.\n- Larger accessibility text sizes now better track the system default sizes.\n- Filters affect widgets properly (as well as searches).\n- Fixed bug where when uploading a bunch of photos Apollo could crash from high memory usage.\n- If device has room the Posts Feed Widget will now show 5 entries instead of 4.\n- For iOS 14 I changed the option to save photos/GIFs/videos to a specific “Apollo” album due to some permission requirements/changes and made it so saving GIFs and videos requires less permissions.\n- If you want to remove r/Popular, r/All, or a Moderator multireddit from the top of your subreddit listing you can simply swipe to do so, or re-enable it via Settings tab \u003e General.\n- General bug fixes for widgets and other general parts across the app to make everything even smoother.\n\nAnd of course all the goodies from 1.10 and 1.9:\n\n- Awesome, customizable iOS 14 home screen widgets to show posts, shortcuts, and more! To add, simply long-press on the home screen, tap the + in the top corner, and select Apollo!\n- Picture in Picture video so you can continue watching video from Apollo when you're doing other things!\n- Viewing and performing crosspots!\n- Icons/images in flair!\n- Set your own flair! Simply go to the subreddit of your choosing, and you can choose from a list of customizable flairs!\n- Tap on the long flair to bring up a window that expands it fully!\n- If the subreddit lets users tag their posts with individual flairs, you can now simply tap on that flair and Apollo will show you all the other posts in the subreddit that have been tagged with that same flair.\n- 5 new icons, the first three are Ultra icons, all made by the incredibly talented designer, Matthew Skiles! Next, we have a beautiful new icon representing the trans pride flag (originally by Monica Helms), which came out awesome! And our incredible community designer, FutureIncident, created the Japanese-inspired Apollo-san icon!\n- Detect if the language of a comment or post is different than the language of your iOS device, and if so, offer to quickly translate it so you can understand the conversation! \n- New auto-completing window that makes it super fast to search and add subreddits.\n- Two handy new additions to collapsing comments in Apollo. The first, Apollo will show you at a glance how many comments are in the collapsed conversation. Second, if you collapse a bunch of comments, and then come back to that same comment section later, Apollo will now remember which comments you had collapsed, and keep them collapsed for you!\n\nThank you so much! I really hope you enjoy the update! More to come!\n\n- Christian","releaseDate":"2020-10-09"},{"versionDisplay":"1.10.3","releaseNotes":"Massive update ahead! iOS 14 features like Widgets, Picture in Picture Video, new Photo Picker, plus tons of other stuff like crossposting, flair improvements, translation features, and so much more!

Read on!\n\n- Fixed \"save image\" disappearing\n- For video playback, controls automatically fade out now\n- “Remember” setting for video audio, where it remembers if you unmuted the video until you either re-mute it or leave the app (or you can set to always unmute, or never unmute)\n- On iPad you can go to the Jump Bar with the command-L keyboard shortcut’\n- Can now use headphones control to pause video \n- Apollo now is more intelligent with autoplaying GIFs/videos and only starts them playing them once a majority is on-screen\n- Fixed crash that could occur with live videos\n- Fixed bug where some GIFs wouldn’t play\n- Fixed bug that could cause app to slow down after watching a bunch of videos\n- If user has thumbnails disabled in their Reddit prefs, Apollo will offer to enable them since it’s normally done accidentally\n- Marking posts read is now harder to do accidentally\n- Fixed bug where you could upvote and downvote at the same time (sidevote?)\n- Fixed bug around tapping awards after collapsing comment\n- Fixed bug with play arrow overlapping video for some GIFs\n- Fixed bug with mouse scroll-wheel support on iPad\n- Fixed bug where some weird GIFs would open in Safari instead of in the app\n- Support for new Reddit/subreddit posting requirements for certain communities\n- With large posts mode, the voting arrows have larger tap targets\n- When sharing with “Share Includes Post Title” enabled, it will now put the post title properly as the subject in an email\n- Subreddit icon fixes\n- Creating links fix\n- Audio resume bug\n- Picture position on iPad\n- Some weird crash fixes\n\nAs always, if you have any further suggestions I’d love to hear them! Thanks for being so awesome! And if you missed all the goodies in 1.8, here’s a quick summary of them!\n\n# Media Viewer (Images, GIFs, Videos, etc.)\n\n- In addition to GIFs, videos now also play inline in the feed, so you no longer have to tap into them in order to see what’s going on at a glance. \n\n- Save/share as GIF!\n\n- Pause GIFs! \n\n- Sharing the video file for Reddit videos now automatically merges the video and audio stream\n\n- Sharing’s much improved and more streamlined, so you can share content even easier.\n\n- On iOS 13 and later you can use haptic touch to long press on an image/video/GIF to preview it quickly\n\n# Share Comment or Post as an Image\n\n- If you’re the type that likes to screenshot a funny comment and send to a friend, now you don’t have to mess around with screenshoting, then cropping, or piecing together multiple images, Apollo will handle it all for you!\n\n# Portrait Lock Buddy\n\n- Apollo now has a Smart Rotation Lock as well as a Portrait Lock Buddy! Check out Settings \u003e General for more info.\n\n# 5 (Five!) New App Icons to Choose From\n\nTwo new Apollo Ultra icons, as well as 3 new additions to the Community Icon Pack!\n\n# New Reddit Awards\n\n- Reddit recently updated the award system to evolve from just Silver, Gold, and Platinum to a variety of fun, new awards. You can view and gift them!\n\n# Reddit Polls\n\n- Support for the new Reddit Polls! Have fun voting in heated community discussions about the intricacies of crocheting. \n\n# Comment Parent Previewing\n\n- On iOS 13 and later comments now get a nice context menu when you use haptic touch on them, but beyond just having some nice options it’ll now actually show you the parent comment to the comment you selected!\n\n# iPad Pointer Support\n\n- iOS 13.4 added a ton of awesome functionality around iPads and mouse/trackpad cursor support. Apollo now supports this thoroughly!\n\n# Thank You\n\nY’all are genuinely the best community, thank you so much for all the support and I really hope you enjoy this update!\n\n- Christian","releaseDate":"2020-06-13"},{"versionDisplay":"1.8.3","releaseNotes":"1.8.3 builds on 1.8 with a bunch of improvements and fixes based on awesome feedback from the community!
