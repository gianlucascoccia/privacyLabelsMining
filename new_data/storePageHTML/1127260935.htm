    One of the most fun and addicting games I have ever playes

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I was skeptical at first that this was going to be another Mobile Strike or Game of War type game but it is the complete opposite of it all. The amount of strategy needed to succeed in the game is unparalleled than most mobile war mmos on the market. You can build an army, rearrange your base how you see fit, attack both other players and NPC’s at different levels with different power levels with make it a truly terrific game to play. When you join a faction you gain access to faction mines that are so much faster and easier at collecting resources that you need to do everything and there are thousands of events everyday that give you so many more different pieces of equipment, power-ups and resources that help. The only downside that I have found to the game is that in the end you will end up having to buy a pack or two to really give you the boost you need to progress through the game rapidly.</p>

    Terrible Customer Service
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been playing this game for 2 years and have enjoyed it. During that timeframe, I’ve built up a strong base. A few days ago, my shield went down and I was attacked multiple times on the game. When I was first alerted to the attack, I tried to enter the game but received multiple messages about server issues. I was locked out of the game for 37 mins while I was attacked several times losing almost a million troops. If it hadn’t been for my teammates already logged on, I would have lost my resources too. When I finally was able to get into the game, several players told me they had also been locked out. I contacted customer service and they advised me that they don’t show any server issues at all that day and refused to help me. I find myself locked out this game several times a week for server issues. It happens so much that they have an FAQ about it on their customer service page. I’ve never complained about it a single time, but the first time I lose everything due to THEIR server issue, they refuse to assist me and even deny that it occurred. This is terrible customer service and I will no longer play this game because of it. My husband and I are both closing out our accounts solely because of the customer service issues.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>You may have tried Mobile Strike and you’ve been asking your self why should I pick up this clone? Well first off let me tell this is not a clone it’s what mobile strike should have been, for starters you can actually witness the battles happen and the map is the entire world! Me being a local Floridian I decided to setup my base in Florida! I usually don’t spend money in game but this one I had to purchase the $4.99 mega pack it was super helpful in giving me that edge and assistance to help control the state! Another cool thing is that there are several worlds so if you want to control a state but there’s a lot of people why not switch to a younger world with less people? I’ve only had some audio issues where if I leave the app and come back there’s no audio or only some audio like music but no interaction audio. Secondly in a game like this where you type in landscape mode it is absolutely a necessity to allow auto correct</p>

SHOW NO MERCY!\nWelcome our explosive new PVP Feature: the FACTION WARS! Join epic one-hour cross-world battles between factions in a unique combat level where you fight for control over strategic forts! The ultimate goal—conquer your enemy’s main base, assert your dominance and WIN!\nThe question is: Are you ready to defend the honor of your faction and fight against foes from different parts of the WPO Universe? If so, let us get straight into the details!\n- There are up to two battles per week for each faction—one attack and one defense.\n- The Faction Leaders \u0026 Diplomats pick the time and the date of the attacks.\n- Up to 200 players can participate in each battle.\n- The war is won by capturing the main base of the opponent. If the timer runs out, the winner is the faction that controls more forts. If there is a tie, the defending side is declared the winner.\n- NO UNITS DIE! You can bring your entire army to the battlefield and not worry about its well-being. Right after the Faction Wars end, your entire army will be teleported back to your airfield—without a scratch!\n- During Faction Wars, the Garage has no maximum capacity—while combat continues, you can repair as many units as you want with the new Repair Gear currency!\n- The Faction Wars Menu: All information you need is in this new section of your Faction menu. There you can see your faction’s current rank, pick the time slot for your next attack (if you are a Faction Leader or Diplomat) and also prepare for a critical defense.\n- Matching Powers: A fair matchmaking system will ensure that you will face enemies of similar strength. So your tactical skills will be crucial in future wars.\n- Faction Wars will become available when your World HQ reaches level 5 and when your faction has 100 or more Influence points.\n- After each battle, based on their score and the outcome of the clash, players will receive Glory XP that will help to level up their Glory Rank. Each new level will unlock powerful bonuses.\nGet ready for non-stop action and explosive surprises!\n\n[SEASONAL CONTENT]\nA) NEW OFFENSIVE ADD-ONS:\n- Barrage Bomb for Commander Walker\n- Backbone Blaster for all commanders\n\nB) WINTER MAYHEM:\n- The Winter Rumble chain event: Join the special events during the holiday week and fill your bag with frosty rewards!\n- The Gift Hunt mini-game: Piles of wrapped presents will spawn on the world map.

The amount of strategy needed to succeed in the game is unparalleled than most mobile war mmos on the market. You can build an army, rearrange your base how you see fit, attack both other players and NPC’s at different levels with different power levels with make it a truly terrific game to play. When you join a faction you gain access to faction mines that are so much faster and easier at collecting resources that you need to do everything and there are thousands of events everyday that give you so many more different pieces of equipment, power-ups and resources that help. The only downside that I have found to the game is that in the end you will end up having to buy a pack or two to really give you the boost you need to progress through the game rapidly.","title":"One of the most fun and addicting games I have ever playes","userName":"Lutzon"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6934091428","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-01-30T23:33:00Z","rating":1,"review":"I have been playing this game for 2 years and have enjoyed it. During that timeframe, I’ve built up a strong base. A few days ago, my shield went down and I was attacked multiple times on the game. When I was first alerted to the attack, I tried to enter the game but received multiple messages about server issues. I was locked out of the game for 37 mins while I was attacked several times losing almost a million troops. If it hadn’t been for my teammates already logged on, I would have lost my resources too. When I finally was able to get into the game, several players told me they had also been locked out. I contacted customer service and they advised me that they don’t show any server issues at all that day and refused to help me. I find myself locked out this game several times a week for server issues. It happens so much that they have an FAQ about it on their customer service page. I’ve never complained about it a single time, but the first time I lose everything due to THEIR server issue, they refuse to assist me and even deny that it occurred. This is terrible customer service and I will no longer play this game because of it. My husband and I are both closing out our accounts solely because of the customer service issues.","title":"Terrible Customer Service","userName":"MadDoggsMom"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2293215291","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-03-11T04:21:10Z","rating":5,"review":"You may have tried Mobile Strike and you’ve been asking your self why should I pick up this clone? Well first off let me tell this is not a clone it’s what mobile strike should have been, for starters you can actually witness the battles happen and the map is the entire world! Me being a local Floridian I decided to setup my base in Florida! I usually don’t spend money in game but this one I had to purchase the $4.99 mega pack it was super helpful in giving me that edge and assistance to help control the state! Another cool thing is that there are several worlds so if you want to control a state but there’s a lot of people why not switch to a younger world with less people?

I wound up in a game room that has a few players that probably spend $1000’s on this game.  They are so powerful that you can’t even fight against them. The only way to compete is to spend as much.  Takes the fun away.  Sure you can get the resources on your own without buying them but it takes hours....6 plus hours.  To get 60k in resources when you need 500k for 1 upgrade of 1 station. So where it can take weeks to upgrade 1 level the competition can upgrade multiple times in 1 hour by spending $50. I know I did that. And now I have 90k troops to the top guys 2million. Not a fair game. I’ve emailed them and nothing. They are obviously happy with the money they are getting.  Don’t get this game. Not worth thousands to play.\n\nStill have not heard back from them.","title":"Super disappointed.

Made it to headquarters level 12. I have been enjoying the casual sense of gameplay, and how “FTP” friendly the game is.\n\nHowever, this game is facing an extremely dangerous problem for its community. The worlds are controlled by a “mega alliance” multiple factions of the top players, all in an alliance. And all they do, is teleport around, and crowd control the population of other factions. Basically a stab, and run mentality. And obviously, this isn’t very cheap do these actions, or to try and defend yourself. The “attacks” on other players, or even the AI is skill-less. You press attack, and then it goes into a simulation. So in the end it’s just a bunch of people dropping loads of money, and having no actual skill involved. \n\nI gave it a three simply because as stated, I would really enjoy the game and all of the features, within the game, the seemingly constant world events and faction events. Makes it really fun. But the tactics of players ruins the game experience for me.","title":"Good, but at the same time.

They can always attack anyone who is half the level or even below 9. And players who are five or six ranks higher attacks even the lowest level of players like a 30 attacking a level 9. There needs to be a restriction on who can you attack but you cannot attack anyone who was way below or higher than you. And the resources and cost is unbearable. And also you cannot leave to another world after you’ve ranked past 9. You’re pretty much stuck in the world after rank 9. So little resources around. Every time you rank up it gets higher to the point where you have to spend a couple of weeks before you actually rank up.

However the game is not the reason I’m writing this review. The customer service for this company is among the worst I’ve encountered for application driven games. If you’re fortunate in getting them to respond the first time, you’re at least ahead of what I had. I had to submit twice and it took 3 days for the second request. When they responded they asked exactly what issue I was experiencing. I replied, an issue with the specific pack I purchased and was not provided. They replied our system has no issues it must have been user error. I was a little upset since my purchase history fell in line to exactly which pack I purchased and did not receive. I asked how can I prove this to you, which they replied again it works just fine and was my fault. Even though many people in game that I spoke with have claimed the same issue.

Was fun playing it, bought a few packs at $5 and $10. Once the packs go up they never come down. My packs are sitting at $50 and $100. Been waiting for months for something to change. The only way I get by is being in a big faction for protection.  If not for the faction.  I wouldn’t be able to play the game from how much the gold costs and you need gold to play and survive in this game.  It is definitely a pay to play, and pay to win. Sent a few feedback messages being polite and understanding and the only thing that has changed is a bigger bar you can write in.  I don’t know if they really care about their player community...  All They care about that I can see is your money.  If I could give less that a star I would. Don’t support pay to win games. The average person can’t beat the people who constantly pay money for this game.  The only reason I kept playing was because of the people.

On the other hand, connectivity is an issue, i have perfect wifi and Wireless connection and its very annoying for the game to constantly boot you to the loading screen when trying to do any action. Its a minor bug that should be taken care of.\n\nIncluding that the faction itself could use improvement. Even if its a collect and conquer type of style. Factions who are allied to other factions should be able to have a Union chat or any system that supports the whole allied Union such as rally, resource trade, and union chat. Sadly the faction doesn't really partake that role of ranks for members. Anyone including the rookies can start war between an allied faction, what i mean by that is. Even if you are allied with another faction. A selfish player would scout and attack an allied union. I believe that the attack and scout should be blocked if you are allied to a different faction.
