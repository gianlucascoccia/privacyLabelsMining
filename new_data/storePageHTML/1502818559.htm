    An absolute MUST HAVE for any ACNH player!!

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app is the best ACNH guide out there for just a couple of bucks. Being able to catalogue everything AC has to offer is such a blessing and its made so easy with the easy-to-use interface and ad-free app. By far the best thing about the app is that you can add a custom task to your daily reminders as a way to show if you’ve done that particular task. For me, since wood is so important, my custom task of breaking 5 flimsy axes is a daily thing for me; and with this app, I can have it as a custom daily task that I can check off. There is also references to other ACNH related content like a designer tool to help make custom designs instead of doing it in-game and passports access to meet other players online and establish new friendships; honestly the amount of things this app provides is absolutely incredible. The only thing I can offer as something to add would be to add a profile section where you can put your in-game name and island name and other personal add-ons such as a picture of your favorite villager or visitor etc... <br /><br />All in all, this is seriously one of the best apps I have had the pleasure of using. Even if you aren’t a hardcore AC fan, the amount of content for $3.99 is unbelievable and I am glad to have purchased it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!<br /><br />Edit: What are the hearts used for? I know its a dumb question, but is it just for saying its “a favorite”? I would honestly love to know.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Really happy to see someone release a fully functioning and up-to-date app to support cataloging of items in ACNH. The checklists are easy to use and I love having the status bars that I can share out to social media. The free alternatives out there don’t hold up in comparison. Definitely worth the price of admission. I canceled my preorder of the printed guide because this app has everything that I need. Also really appreciate the embedded links to other companion apps like the turnip price tracker, island designer, etc. If I had to make any recommendations for improvement I might suggest a tab for a customizable daily task list for people to keep up with things like fossil hunting, tree shaking, rock hitting, and so on. Also, it doesn’t appear to support iCloud backup of data and it doesn’t work on an older iPad (gives an error about not having iOS 13). Any way to implement iCloud backup or a way to register an account to safeguard my data would be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to the seasonal updates as new items become available.<br /><br />UPDATE: Appreciate the prompt and direct response from the developer and within a day, the daily checklist and other quality of life features have already been added! Good to know that iCloud support is in the pipeline, too. I will continue to recommend this to everyone I know that plays ACNH. :)</p>

I released an update of the app today that adds a daily tasks list, which of course is fully customizable. I hope you like it! iCloud sync is something that&#39;s definitely on my list of things to add to the app!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>(I’m leaving my original review intact but now with the updated information/solution after reaching out to the app designer)<br />Updated review: this app actually syncs to iCloud and I didn’t realize this and must’ve disabled it or something went awry when I last updated my phone. After resyncing to iCloud all of my missing data reappeared. If this happens to you, the app designer would like to look into the logs before you resync to make sure that was the issue because this can differ from device to device.<br />After learning this info I’ve changed my review to 5 stars and I’m very happy with the app. <br /><br />I love this app because it stays updated constantly and gives a lot of information about each item/creature , but whenever the app last updated all of my saved info got deleted. I had almost all of the diys checked off and the museum collection checked off. So I have no idea what I’m missing anymore because that progress has been deleted. I had all of my cataloged items checked off to tell me what I was missing and now I have to go back through the thousands of items I’ve collected over time and recheck them off even knowing there’s a chance they could be deleted again. That’s truly going to take hours and that’s extremely frustrating.</p>

Being able to catalogue everything AC has to offer is such a blessing and its made so easy with the easy-to-use interface and ad-free app. By far the best thing about the app is that you can add a custom task to your daily reminders as a way to show if you’ve done that particular task. For me, since wood is so important, my custom task of breaking 5 flimsy axes is a daily thing for me; and with this app, I can have it as a custom daily task that I can check off. There is also references to other ACNH related content like a designer tool to help make custom designs instead of doing it in-game and passports access to meet other players online and establish new friendships; honestly the amount of things this app provides is absolutely incredible. The only thing I can offer as something to add would be to add a profile section where you can put your in-game name and island name and other personal add-ons such as a picture of your favorite villager or visitor etc... \n\nAll in all, this is seriously one of the best apps I have had the pleasure of using. Even if you aren’t a hardcore AC fan, the amount of content for $3.99 is unbelievable and I am glad to have purchased it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!\n\nEdit: What are the hearts used for? I know its a dumb question, but is it just for saying its “a favorite”? I would honestly love to know.","title":"An absolute MUST HAVE for any ACNH player!!","userName":"SteelStrife"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5908323151","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-05-06T02:09:41Z","developerResponse":{"id":15111424,"body":"Thank you so much for your review and for sharing your feedback!

The checklists are easy to use and I love having the status bars that I can share out to social media. The free alternatives out there don’t hold up in comparison. Definitely worth the price of admission. I canceled my preorder of the printed guide because this app has everything that I need. Also really appreciate the embedded links to other companion apps like the turnip price tracker, island designer, etc. If I had to make any recommendations for improvement I might suggest a tab for a customizable daily task list for people to keep up with things like fossil hunting, tree shaking, rock hitting, and so on. Also, it doesn’t appear to support iCloud backup of data and it doesn’t work on an older iPad (gives an error about not having iOS 13). Any way to implement iCloud backup or a way to register an account to safeguard my data would be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to the seasonal updates as new items become available.\n\nUPDATE: Appreciate the prompt and direct response from the developer and within a day, the daily checklist and other quality of life features have already been added! Good to know that iCloud support is in the pipeline, too.

After resyncing to iCloud all of my missing data reappeared. If this happens to you, the app designer would like to look into the logs before you resync to make sure that was the issue because this can differ from device to device.\nAfter learning this info I’ve changed my review to 5 stars and I’m very happy with the app. \n\nI love this app because it stays updated constantly and gives a lot of information about each item/creature , but whenever the app last updated all of my saved info got deleted. I had almost all of the diys checked off and the museum collection checked off. So I have no idea what I’m missing anymore because that progress has been deleted. I had all of my cataloged items checked off to tell me what I was missing and now I have to go back through the thousands of items I’ve collected over time and recheck them off even knowing there’s a chance they could be deleted again.

But this app is so much more than just an encyclopedia of Animal Crossing knowledge. It helps me keep track of what fossils, fish, bugs, paintings, and sea creatures I have. It tells me how many creatures I have left to catch during the month before they disappear for the season, and pictures of both the real and fake versions of Redd’s art. If there’s anything you need to know about ACNH, this app has it. Even the fact that they updated it to have the newly added sea creatures right away shows how dedicated they are. I’m honestly in love with how customizable the tasks and everything are. It’s incredible. The only thing that might be able to be improved is the quality of the art in the art tab, but that’s such a minor thing that I’m not really mad at it. I love this and I’m going to recommend it to all of my ACNL friends. \n\nThank you so much for making this. I truly appreciate it, having all of this info in one place just a tap away.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention just how aesthetically pleasing this app is.

You can customize your homepage, including a very customizable daily to-do list. You can see new bugs and fish near the beginning of the month, and which bugs and fish are leaving near the end of the month. It will tell you the next birthday and all good gifts for every villager. The event items seem to update within hours of launch. One of the best things? Time travel support. Easier than changing the time on your switch. Everything is super intuitive and easy on the eyes. I’ve never had this app crash. Its getting updated and better all the time. It’s ad-free. I ended up stuck back on May 7 until today trying to keep a villager from voiding (success) and now I have to rapidly time travel forward one day at a time to get to the present day.

The app is one of the best (if not the best!) AC:NH guides out there. Worth every penny. This has pretty much everything you need to ensure that you maximize every opportunity to improve your island and collect everything. I’m very much looking forward to how this app updates for future AC:NH updates as well. Most importantly for me, every UI element is smooth and looks extremely polished with a lot of thought and effort (and yay, even has a dark mode!). The customization within the app, such as creating your own daily tasks, is such a great tool to have (I’ve forgotten to check in at the Nook Stop all the time before I used this app). And even in the most recent update, keeping track of visitors and automatically integrating it into the daily tasks is wonderful. Keeping track of everything has never been easier with this. The one thing I really would like is to be able to see how my predicted turnip prices will be changing throughout the week within the app, and without having to go to the TurnipProphet website. (I believe the other AC:NH guide on the App Store at this time has this already, but I would absolutely love to see it in a polished and clean UI like this!)

However I took a gamble and trust me it payed off in so many ways. This is one of the most well developed looking apps. Since I have had it they have added new features such as a daily task list that you can totally customize and they added villager lists! Truthfully as this app has expanded I have deleted almost all my other apps. \nI will also say my favorite feature is that you can look at what fish and insects are available at the current time and can sort so that it shows you which ones you have not gotten yet. \nIf you do decide to get this app make sure you explore and play around with it! There are so many ways to customize your view if you take a few minutes. Also make sure you go to more in the  and scroll to bottom because there are some awesome community resources listed!\nThis app truly has almost everything! The only thing it currently does not have is a place where you can connect with others for turnip trading or other events.

I use it every time I play ACNH! The developer made checking off the things you’ve collected so simple and easy. You can even favorite items that you want to work towards getting or things that you like or that you may already have including furniture, clothes, villagers, diys, mystery islands, tools, all you can think of- check em off or fav them-  nice and simple with some info to go along with each item. You can view critters and fish in a bunch of assorted ways, by month, what time they are available, etc. it’s very helpful! The fine details included are also extremely helpful and informative. It covers all  basis. \nThe one thing that would be cool to add would be a compatibility chart for the villagers but that’s just an idea. Even without it the app is perfection. And I loved reading past reviews and seeing so many suggestions from people being integrated into the app. \nI like the developers updates as well.

It’s made it very easy for me to log what I’ve collected and what I still need! Being able to track everything as real time goes by just as it does in the game is very helpful! \nThe addition of Southern Hemisphere use has made the app a lot better in my opinion, and is all it took for me to bump my rating up to 5 stars! (I’m in the north myself, but all should be included, of course). \nOver time I’ve been exploring the many functions of this app, and I must say, the continuous attention to detail and high levels of support are what I love to see! All of the resources, like the map creator, pattern maker, and town tune maker are very welcome, and very thoughtful! I also appreciate the ability to report any errors I come across. While the game is still new, and I still haven’t personally found any errors myself, it’s good to know the option is at least there in the event that I do. \n\nOverall, wonderful app, excited to see where it could go in the future!

I remember thinking to myself that I wish there were an app for my phone that helped me keep track of things like fossils and daily tasks and here it is! The interface is minimalistic and very nice to look at, especially in dark mode. It is also very easy to find everything I need, customize it if needed, and I love being able to see my completion rates for various collections and the ability to share them directly from the app. I also am extremely fond of the information screens for bugs and fish. Being able to see the different price rates, where the creature can be located and when, etc is so convenient and saves me time from having to open safari and have tons of tabs open. Seriously, I cannot gush enough about this app, and it was well worth the purchase. I usually never write reviews for apps, but this has definitely made my Animal Crossing experience even better than before.
