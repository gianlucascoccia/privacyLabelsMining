Nikola is working for you.\n \nPrivacy:\n \n• Nikola does not store your Tesla account password. The Nikola App on your Apple Device communicates directly with Tesla to obtain an authentication token, and saves the token to process vehicle data. The Nikola servers do not see or store your password.

    Best Tesla App Available! HIGHLY RECOMMEND ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I wish I could give more than a five star rating for this app. First and foremost, the developer is an extremely nice individual who takes a genuine interest in making sure the app is always at its best. He is extremely hands on with it, and each time the app updates, you get more cool features to use! This app is not only fun to use, it is genuinely interesting and extremely useful for anyone who owns a Tesla! <br /><br />Several days ago I accidentally left one of my windows down when I parked my car, and I had just arrived at the Doctor’s when I got a notification that I had left the window all the way down. Well, I obviously ran back to my car quick and rolled it up and then went to my Doctor appointment. When I came back outside after my appointment it was POURING down rain!! I let out a huge sigh of relief that I got the notification when I did, otherwise I could’ve had a lot of damage to the inside of my car. <br /><br />Most people, including myself, would give just the app an easy 5-star rating by itself, but when you add on how knowledgeable, friendly and dedicated the Developer is, you really can’t ask for anything more!<br /><br />100% RECOMMEND ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I haven’t even tried the app. This review is because of the way this app tries to get you pay. There is no clear information about the fees.  So you may think the app is free. Then you download the app and on first step he asks for your Tesla credentials before showing anything else. Now that he got your email and access to your Tesla account, he will hit you with the price that you MUST sign up or you can’t even access the app. The trial period that he offers is 7 days, but that’s also provided to you AFTER you give your credit card information. Because he already got your name and email, he automatically adds you to his mailing list and start sending you marketing emails, even if you don’t sign up and you delete the app immediately (which I did). So, basically, unless you give him your Tesla account access AND your credit card information, you get nothing from this app. But he gets your data to use for God knows what else in addition to marketing. The app features may be good (I don’t know because I didn’t give him my credit card info) but because the process is not honest, I don’t trust this type of people or companies.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hello,I&#39;ms sorry the app wasn&#39;t what you were looking for. That said, I hope you&#39;ll consider the harm done by negatively reviewing an app you haven&#39;t tried.<br /><br />I do declare in the description that the app requires at least a trial. This is because monitoring Tesla&#39;s is very expensive for me to do. Apple unfortunately doesn&#39;t have a &quot;subscription required&quot; declaration I can put on the download button. Would you mind updating your review so people know I&#39;m not misleading users?<br /><br />Here&#39;s what&#39;s always been in the app store description: &quot;Note: Nikola requires a subscription, paid from your App Store Account. Nikola offers an automatic one-week free trial before payment. The Nikola subscription will automatically renew and charge your account $9.99 at the end of the trial, and each month after that. You can cancel your free trial or subscription at any time by going to your iTunes Account Settings at least 24 hours before the end of the period.&quot;<br /><br />Additionally, Nikola does not collect credit card info, as that is against Apple&#39;s rules. Nikola simply accepts subscriptions via your App Store account. Unlike other Tesla apps, you can try Nikola for free before paying anything.<br /><br />Thanks for checking out the app.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve tried several other apps but find this one to be nearly perfect for what I was looking for. I found it to be informative with its data and reports as well as simple to understand the way things were laid out.  I am also an Apple Watch user and find the watch interface very useful.  Whenever I’ve had questions or suggestions, the app developer has been quick to respond and eager to help.  <br /><br />Thanks for a great app and I can’t wait to see how it continues to be improved on an already great product!</p>

He is extremely hands on with it, and each time the app updates, you get more cool features to use! This app is not only fun to use, it is genuinely interesting and extremely useful for anyone who owns a Tesla! \n\nSeveral days ago I accidentally left one of my windows down when I parked my car, and I had just arrived at the Doctor’s when I got a notification that I had left the window all the way down. Well, I obviously ran back to my car quick and rolled it up and then went to my Doctor appointment. When I came back outside after my appointment it was POURING down rain!! I let out a huge sigh of relief that I got the notification when I did, otherwise I could’ve had a lot of damage to the inside of my car. \n\nMost people, including myself, would give just the app an easy 5-star rating by itself, but when you add on how knowledgeable, friendly and dedicated the Developer is, you really can’t ask for anything more!\n\n100% RECOMMEND ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","title":"Best Tesla App Available!

That said, I hope you'll consider the harm done by negatively reviewing an app you haven't tried.\n\nI do declare in the description that the app requires at least a trial. This is because monitoring Tesla's is very expensive for me to do. Apple unfortunately doesn't have a \"subscription required\" declaration I can put on the download button. Would you mind updating your review so people know I'm not misleading users?\n\nHere's what's always been in the app store description: \"Note: Nikola requires a subscription, paid from your App Store Account. Nikola offers an automatic one-week free trial before payment. The Nikola subscription will automatically renew and charge your account $9.99 at the end of the trial, and each month after that. You can cancel your free trial or subscription at any time by going to your iTunes Account Settings at least 24 hours before the end of the period.\"\n\nAdditionally, Nikola does not collect credit card info, as that is against Apple's rules. Nikola simply accepts subscriptions via your App Store account. Unlike other Tesla apps, you can try Nikola for free before paying anything.\n\nThanks for checking out the app.","modified":"2021-05-19T07:27:57Z"},"rating":1,"review":"I haven’t even tried the app. This review is because of the way this app tries to get you pay. There is no clear information about the fees.  So you may think the app is free. Then you download the app and on first step he asks for your Tesla credentials before showing anything else. Now that he got your email and access to your Tesla account, he will hit you with the price that you MUST sign up or you can’t even access the app. The trial period that he offers is 7 days, but that’s also provided to you AFTER you give your credit card information. Because he already got your name and email, he automatically adds you to his mailing list and start sending you marketing emails, even if you don’t sign up and you delete the app immediately (which I did). So, basically, unless you give him your Tesla account access AND your credit card information, you get nothing from this app. But he gets your data to use for God knows what else in addition to marketing. The app features may be good (I don’t know because I didn’t give him my credit card info) but because the process is not honest, I don’t trust this type of people or companies.","title":"No Transparency","userName":"bccom"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6936964555","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-01-31T16:39:48Z","developerResponse":{"id":21038412,"body":"Thank you so much!

I wanted to let you know that Nikola states in as many places as possible / Apple allows that there is a subscription after the trial. It is listed in the App Store listing as Apple requires, and on the website. Apple doesn't have an option for \"subscription required\" with the download button, though I wish they did. \n\nUnlike with other apps, you are free to try Nikola at zero cost to see if it's worth it. I'm also incentivized to continue making the app better, which is why Nikola has thousands of happy paying users.\n\nWhile I wish Nikola could be completely free, Nikola has serious ongoing costs to do vehicle and battery health monitoring, so a one-time purchase or a free App wouldn't be doable. That said, I'm happy to report I'm working on an update that does have a free tier now that I've managed to bring my costs down a bit!\n\nAnyway, feel free to reach out to me if you have any more questions. I can be reached at david@nikolaapp.com. I'd also be happy to extend a longer trial to give more time to see the value of the app.\n\nAdditionally, if you feel I've addressed your concerns, it would mean a lot to me if you'd consider updating your review, as I'm representing this App as correctly as Apple allows in their rules.","modified":"2021-04-15T03:15:10Z"},"rating":1,"review":"I absolutely hate apps that don’t clearly state upfront that they are not free, which even reading details before installing didn’t make clear in this case; the way it was presented, it was reasonable to expect that subscription to additional features was OPTIONAL. I don’t care how much others praise this app, in fact the top comment in the app store admits to knowing the developer. \n\nBecause this was such misrepresentation which I only fully discovered after having given this app my Tesla account credentials, I have no trust whatsoever and immediately deleted the app and will have to change my Tesla password.\n\nI installed STATS long ago and absolutely love it, but the huge difference is I knew ahead of time of the app’s cost.","title":"Misrepresentation","userName":"Gilles E Coyote"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7331802312","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-05-13T01:57:46Z","developerResponse":{"id":22825246,"body":"Thank you so much!

The addition of the Apple Watch app provided me with a tool I didn’t know I needed. The addition of the watch complication for watchOS 7 and the Home Screen widget for iOS 14 is yet another game changer. \n\nWhat I’m getting at is that you should give this app a try. Is it free? No, but if you give the trial a try you’ll understand it’s worth the asking price. \n\nIt’s worth paying a developer that’s invested in their product. If this was for sale at $19-$29 it would probably be just as cool, but for how long?

If you were charged and want to cancel, we'll refund you.\n\nIf you don't mind, once we get this fixed for you, it would mean a lot to me if you could update this review with the new info.

Interestingly enough there is no place either on the app or the website where you can cancel the trial period. The only thing I could do was to delete the app.  Reached out to the developer and was still charged for the first month subscription.
