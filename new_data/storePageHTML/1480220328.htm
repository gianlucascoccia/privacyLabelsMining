  <script id="ember23612152" name="schema:software-application" class="ember-view" type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"SoftwareApplication","name":"Tiimo - Visual Daily Planner","description":"Tiimo is a visual daily planning app that helps you organize your life, stick to your routines, and work towards your personal goals.  \n\nWith a subscription, you can use it at home, in school and at work to support you in doing the things you need to do, in a visual and motivating way! Tiimo leverages the fact that visual information is considerably more effective than written information for many.\n\nTiimo is designed to be inclusive and helpful across neurodiversity, including for people with ADHD and/or autism, and support executive function challenges like planning, organization, time management, and focus. Our features specifically support these areas. \n\n** KEY FEATURES ** \n\n+ A visual timeline supports time management and focus. \n\n+ Visual checklists help you keep track of each point on your list not only by text but also by using colours, emojis or icons. \n\n+ Ongoing reminders (notifications, vibrations and sound) halfway through and at the end of activities increase motivation and help with transitions.\n\n+ Pre-made routines, designed with common activities, that make scheduling faster.\n\n+ Choose between +3000 icons, including unique background colours, emojis, as well as the option to upload your own images.\n\n+ Joint-use function means the app can easily be used between family members, or an adult and a child. \n\n+ With one Tiimo subscription you can create up to five different profiles/schedules.\n\n+ NEW: Calendar integration with iCal (and others if synced), color theme picker, darkmode and flexible activities that you can \"play\", \"pause\" and \"resume\".\n\n** OUR USERS SAY ** \n\n“This app is a godsend. I used to use a planner to get through each day but a planner doesn’t notify you if you forget to check it. I highly recommend this for anyone on the spectrum or even if you just struggle with executive functioning skills.”\n\n“I just wanted to take a minute to say how incredible I think this app is! As a visual learner, this has such an engaging structure that makes it reliable and causes me so much less stress when I’m trying to stay organized.  I have already recommended this app to multiple people/platforms!’’\n\n“Tiimo makes me feel “in control” because I’m able to see my day visually, and I can build up a library of routines to make scheduling a breeze. I always know what is coming next which reduces anxiety and helps me focus on what I am currently doing. The power of Tiimo is that they know their audience and build specifically for them. This makes such a difference. They listen and respond promptly, I can tell that they care about the community they build their app for. I’m excited to see this app evolve even more in the future.\"\n\nGet started with Tiimo today! \n\n- We financially support neurodivergent partners &amp; creators\n- We are a small company on a mission to make a big difference\n- We are 100% ad free and proud of it\n- We don't sell your data\n\nTiimo is a paid subscription app with a 14-day free trial.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Tiimo is a visual daily planning app that helps you organize your life, stick to your routines, and work towards your personal goals.  <br /><br />With a subscription, you can use it at home, in school and at work to support you in doing the things you need to do, in a visual and motivating way! Tiimo leverages the fact that visual information is considerably more effective than written information for many.<br /><br />Tiimo is designed to be inclusive and helpful across neurodiversity, including for people with ADHD and/or autism, and support executive function challenges like planning, organization, time management, and focus. Our features specifically support these areas. <br /><br />** KEY FEATURES ** <br /><br />+ A visual timeline supports time management and focus. <br /><br />+ Visual checklists help you keep track of each point on your list not only by text but also by using colours, emojis or icons. <br /><br />+ Ongoing reminders (notifications, vibrations and sound) halfway through and at the end of activities increase motivation and help with transitions.<br /><br />+ Pre-made routines, designed with common activities, that make scheduling faster.<br /><br />+ Choose between +3000 icons, including unique background colours, emojis, as well as the option to upload your own images.<br /><br />+ Joint-use function means the app can easily be used between family members, or an adult and a child. <br /><br />+ With one Tiimo subscription you can create up to five different profiles/schedules.<br /><br />+ NEW: Calendar integration with iCal (and others if synced), color theme picker, darkmode and flexible activities that you can &quot;play&quot;, &quot;pause&quot; and &quot;resume&quot;.<br /><br />** OUR USERS SAY ** <br /><br />“This app is a godsend. I used to use a planner to get through each day but a planner doesn’t notify you if you forget to check it. I highly recommend this for anyone on the spectrum or even if you just struggle with executive functioning skills.”<br /><br />“I just wanted to take a minute to say how incredible I think this app is! As a visual learner, this has such an engaging structure that makes it reliable and causes me so much less stress when I’m trying to stay organized.  I have already recommended this app to multiple people/platforms!’’<br /><br />“Tiimo makes me feel “in control” because I’m able to see my day visually, and I can build up a library of routines to make scheduling a breeze. I always know what is coming next which reduces anxiety and helps me focus on what I am currently doing. The power of Tiimo is that they know their audience and build specifically for them. This makes such a difference. They listen and respond promptly, I can tell that they care about the community they build their app for. I’m excited to see this app evolve even more in the future.&quot;<br /><br />Get started with Tiimo today! <br /><br />- We financially support neurodivergent partners &amp; creators<br />- We are a small company on a mission to make a big difference<br />- We are 100% ad free and proud of it<br />- We don&#39;t sell your data<br /><br />Tiimo is a paid subscription app with a 14-day free trial.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>As someone who is neurodivergent, this app has helped me bring order and structure to what was an overwhelming amount of unstructured time. I highly recommend trying it for a couple weeks if you think you’ll benefit, because you’ll probably find it as helpful as I did.<br /><br />Now for why I docked a star: there are a couple of things that could really improve the app. A search feature for the icons would streamline use. More background colors as well (especially a white background option) would be nice, as I’ve found I run out of color coding colors quickly. Also, being able to schedule multiple things at one time (such as eating lunch while at work) and being able to more easily repeat activities on the same day (rather than just the next day/ week at the same time) would be great for those of us who take meds more than once daily and while doing other things. Finally, adapting the app to be available to sync on the smarter FitBit devices would be VERY helpful (I’d gladly pay a fee to download it onto my device if that’s what it takes). Though these would make the app better and more useful, it’s already pretty great, so if I had the option to give it 4.5 instead of 4, I would have.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Dear katswimmer,<br /><br />First of all thank you so much for giving us this lovely review ✨<br /><br />I am happy to let you know that very soon you can search in icons. We just need to test it properly before sending it out there!<br /><br />I&#39;ve noted down you wish for more colors. Did you know you can also create your own colors by clicking the + button when you select icon color?<br /><br />We are right now working on activities that have a duration only so that you can start them when it fits you. That will allow you to have multiple things going on, as you can start activities while still having some scheduled.<br /><br />Officially we don&#39;t support FitBit. However if the watch mirrors your phone notifications, you would get your notifications from Tiimo as well as other apps on your phone. Some users have gotten back to us saying they do this, however we didn&#39;t test this ourselves so no guarantees 🙏<br /><br />Thank you for the review, and for the feedback! 💚<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Signe from Tiimo<br /></p>

    Improving, but there are still problems

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I fully acknowledge that this app is a work in progress, and is getting a little better with every update. But there’s still a perpetual problem where as soon as Tiimo is updated, a new feature is rolled out, bugs are fixed and glitches are patched, there is always another problem or new bugs that come up when it seems to be improving. It’s like one step forward and two steps back. I don’t quite understand that because the concept and design of this app seems pretty simple (although I’m sure there’s more to it under the surface). <br /><br />I don’t know, I’m just trying to get through my days, get stuff done and not let ADHD (and what I suspect is ASD) get the best of me. This app helps some, but the benefits kind of become redundant when I have to manually go in and correct things because little bugs in the program throw off my routine. The one I’m the most frustrated with right now is the fact that Tiimo likes to log me out of the app on my Apple Watch randomly - it almost always happens overnight, and it sometimes when I’m in the middle of an active routine, and I don’t realize until more time than I had intended to spend on an activity has passed and then “whoops! I have to enter my log-in information again.” <br /><br />If you have ADHD or are on the autism spectrum, you know how frustrating and discouraging interruptions to routine can be, especially in their early stages before you’re fully comfortable with them.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi, CalvinationStation! Thanks for your review. Please know that we understand your frustration, it is not our intention to develop new features and then be plagued by some bugs. Our intention is for the app to run as smoothly as possible so that it can be a helpful tool that users also enjoy using. The team is already aware of the Apple Watch issue and there is an update on the way which is going to fix this issue (being released very soon). We truly apologise for all the inconvenience this has caused you. Warmly, Team Tiimo <br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I don’t have adhd or autism but this app has helped me to reflect and improve on my routines and systems a lot. It’s one of the best calendar / routine apps since Google Calendar , which is saying a lot bc GCal was the standard for years and over these past few months I’ve already fallen in love with tiimos capabilities. Only thing is I am unable to use the new Widget functionality on the app which I was looking forward to. I have the latest tiimo version so I’m not sure why it’s not available for my iPhone? But that brings me to my suggestions:<br /><br />What would really make this app spectacular is if it had 2-way sync with Apple Calendar /Google Calendar and if there was a way to block other apps while using this app. <br />2-way sync is important to me because i like my events and routines to be backed in my base calendar which is Google Calendar. And having to switch between the two constantly can be frustrating. Also, my second point kind of relates to the widget feature, as I would like to be focused on only the tiimo activity that’s currently scheduled and not be distracted, but having to open the app each time defeats that purpose. Nevertheless I’m excited for what’s to come feature wise with this app as its grown so much, if these features could also be taken into consideration I’d appreciate</p>

You can also pause flexible activities and start them again when it fits. Dont worry - you can still use tiimo exactly like you did before, planning activities in a timed schedule. But now you have the option to not set a specific time for certain activities as well!\n\nIt means you can have many activities ongoing at the same time. That is why we have added a little thumbnail for “Right now” of your ongoing activities so you can switch in focus between different activities.\n\nWe’ve made some visual changes to the activity card in My Day as well. Icons are moved to the right side so that you quickly browse through your day visually with activities and checklist items.\n\nThanks for all your feedback and ideas! We read and listen to all of them. We have so many great features coming very soon. Next being a new and improved routine system, and more usability updates. So stay tuned!\n\nP.S. if you like our app, please don’t hesitate to rate and review us.

Tiimo leverages the fact that visual information is considerably more effective than written information for many.\n\nTiimo is designed to be inclusive and helpful across neurodiversity, including for people with ADHD and/or autism, and support executive function challenges like planning, organization, time management, and focus. Our features specifically support these areas. \n\n** KEY FEATURES ** \n\n+ A visual timeline supports time management and focus. \n\n+ Visual checklists help you keep track of each point on your list not only by text but also by using colours, emojis or icons. \n\n+ Ongoing reminders (notifications, vibrations and sound) halfway through and at the end of activities increase motivation and help with transitions.\n\n+ Pre-made routines, designed with common activities, that make scheduling faster.\n\n+ Choose between +3000 icons, including unique background colours, emojis, as well as the option to upload your own images.\n\n+ Joint-use function means the app can easily be used between family members, or an adult and a child. \n\n+ With one Tiimo subscription you can create up to five different profiles/schedules.\n\n+ NEW: Calendar integration with iCal (and others if synced), color theme picker, darkmode and flexible activities that you can \"play\", \"pause\" and \"resume\".\n\n** OUR USERS SAY ** \n\n“This app is a godsend. I used to use a planner to get through each day but a planner doesn’t notify you if you forget to check it. I highly recommend this for anyone on the spectrum or even if you just struggle with executive functioning skills.”\n\n“I just wanted to take a minute to say how incredible I think this app is! As a visual learner, this has such an engaging structure that makes it reliable and causes me so much less stress when I’m trying to stay organized.  I have already recommended this app to multiple people/platforms!’’\n\n“Tiimo makes me feel “in control” because I’m able to see my day visually, and I can build up a library of routines to make scheduling a breeze.

I highly recommend trying it for a couple weeks if you think you’ll benefit, because you’ll probably find it as helpful as I did.\n\nNow for why I docked a star: there are a couple of things that could really improve the app. A search feature for the icons would streamline use. More background colors as well (especially a white background option) would be nice, as I’ve found I run out of color coding colors quickly. Also, being able to schedule multiple things at one time (such as eating lunch while at work) and being able to more easily repeat activities on the same day (rather than just the next day/ week at the same time) would be great for those of us who take meds more than once daily and while doing other things. Finally, adapting the app to be available to sync on the smarter FitBit devices would be VERY helpful (I’d gladly pay a fee to download it onto my device if that’s what it takes). Though these would make the app better and more useful, it’s already pretty great, so if I had the option to give it 4.5 instead of 4, I would have.","title":"I LOVE this app, but there are a couple kinks","userName":"katswimmer"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7962710670","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-10-28T13:31:37Z","developerResponse":{"id":26036058,"body":"Hi, CalvinationStation!

But there’s still a perpetual problem where as soon as Tiimo is updated, a new feature is rolled out, bugs are fixed and glitches are patched, there is always another problem or new bugs that come up when it seems to be improving. It’s like one step forward and two steps back. I don’t quite understand that because the concept and design of this app seems pretty simple (although I’m sure there’s more to it under the surface). \n\nI don’t know, I’m just trying to get through my days, get stuff done and not let ADHD (and what I suspect is ASD) get the best of me. This app helps some, but the benefits kind of become redundant when I have to manually go in and correct things because little bugs in the program throw off my routine. The one I’m the most frustrated with right now is the fact that Tiimo likes to log me out of the app on my Apple Watch randomly - it almost always happens overnight, and it sometimes when I’m in the middle of an active routine, and I don’t realize until more time than I had intended to spend on an activity has passed and then “whoops! I have to enter my log-in information again.” \n\nIf you have ADHD or are on the autism spectrum, you know how frustrating and discouraging interruptions to routine can be, especially in their early stages before you’re fully comfortable with them.","title":"Improving, but there are still problems","userName":"CalvinationStation"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7728668573","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-08-24T10:43:06Z","developerResponse":{"id":24692579,"body":"Dear habits are a blessing!

It’s one of the best calendar / routine apps since Google Calendar , which is saying a lot bc GCal was the standard for years and over these past few months I’ve already fallen in love with tiimos capabilities. Only thing is I am unable to use the new Widget functionality on the app which I was looking forward to. I have the latest tiimo version so I’m not sure why it’s not available for my iPhone? But that brings me to my suggestions:\n\nWhat would really make this app spectacular is if it had 2-way sync with Apple Calendar /Google Calendar and if there was a way to block other apps while using this app. \n2-way sync is important to me because i like my events and routines to be backed in my base calendar which is Google Calendar. And having to switch between the two constantly can be frustrating. Also, my second point kind of relates to the widget feature, as I would like to be focused on only the tiimo activity that’s currently scheduled and not be distracted, but having to open the app each time defeats that purpose.

Drag and drop to adjust times of routines or activities. Calendar items would be locked/static and then tasks can shift around as needed between scheduled events. \n2. Visual representation of gaps in the day. I like how the Structured app does this. It shows how much time there is between tasks/events on your schedule and asks if you would like to add anything.  Also their time blocks(bubbles) are larger or smaller based on the length of the task/event. \n3.  Option to add routines to schedule based on end time rather than start time.  This takes away the headache of doing the mental math of trying to plug tasks/routines into my schedule. For example I want to leave the house or be in bed by a certain time and that changes from day to day. I would like to be able to set my morning / evening routines accordingly.

Sometimes in the routine I like to change where something goes, like I wanna make my bed first instead of after I brush my teeth for example. It’s really hard to change the location of it because then you have to change all of the times individually. I just wish there was a way to like, drag the activity somewhere else and it would immediately change the times of everything after it to match instead of the times overlapping.

Tiimo wouldn’t allow me to adjust the break time, instead either pushing ahead or requiring me to pause the whole routine.\n\nI feel like this app could be very useful, but with the existing bugs, I don’t find it worth the subscription price.

Tiimo leverages the fact that visual information is considerably more effective than written information for many.\n\nTiimo is designed to be inclusive and helpful across neurodiversity, including for people with ADHD and/or autism, and support executive function challenges like planning, organization, time management, and focus. Our features specifically support these areas. \n\n** KEY FEATURES ** \n\n+ A visual timeline supports time management and focus. \n\n+ Visual checklists help you keep track of each point on your list not only by text but also by using colours, emojis or icons. \n\n+ Ongoing reminders (notifications, vibrations and sound) halfway through and at the end of activities increase motivation and help with transitions.\n\n+ Pre-made routines, designed with common activities, that make scheduling faster.\n\n+ Choose between +3000 icons, including unique background colours, emojis, as well as the option to upload your own images.\n\n+ Joint-use function means the app can easily be used between family members, or an adult and a child. \n\n+ With one Tiimo subscription you can create up to five different profiles/schedules.\n\n+ NEW: Calendar integration with iCal (and others if synced), color theme picker, darkmode and flexible activities that you can \"play\", \"pause\" and \"resume\".\n\n** OUR USERS SAY ** \n\n“This app is a godsend. I used to use a planner to get through each day but a planner doesn’t notify you if you forget to check it. I highly recommend this for anyone on the spectrum or even if you just struggle with executive functioning skills.”\n\n“I just wanted to take a minute to say how incredible I think this app is! As a visual learner, this has such an engaging structure that makes it reliable and causes me so much less stress when I’m trying to stay organized.  I have already recommended this app to multiple people/platforms!’’\n\n“Tiimo makes me feel “in control” because I’m able to see my day visually, and I can build up a library of routines to make scheduling a breeze. I always know what is coming next which reduces anxiety and helps me focus on what I am currently doing. The power of Tiimo is that they know their audience and build specifically for them. This makes such a difference. They listen and respond promptly, I can tell that they care about the community they build their app for. I’m excited to see this app evolve even more in the future.\"\n\nGet started with Tiimo today! \n\n- We financially support neurodivergent partners \u0026 creators\n- We are a small company on a mission to make a big difference\n- We are 100% ad free and proud of it\n- We don't sell your data\n\nTiimo is a paid subscription app with a 14-day free trial.
