        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Like i said, the app works great, its intuitive, easy to navigate, and very modern. It lacks in two places: where it supports english as a language, most of the internal menus and screens are hard coded in french — this is frustrating! The other area is the Spanish banking ecosystem support is severely lacking compared to the french.</p>

Also, Bankin&#39; is a French start-up which explains that most of our banks are French. You have the possibility to suggest a bank directly in your app on the main page.
