        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>We are back with a big new update for MoneyCoach. <br />Here’s what’s new:<br /><br />=== Monterey Support ===<br />We’ve updated the app to make the most out of the new things included with the macOS Monterey release. New designs, new icons, new navigation options, new materials and so much more. MoneyCoach on the Mac has never felt any better. Note that this new update is only available for devices running macOS Monterey 12.0 or later.<br /><br />=== Locations ===<br />Yes! When adding a new transaction, you can search for a location and attach it to your transaction. This is just the beginning of this feature as we have plans to expand it even more in the future with additional insights and reports based on your spending locations.<br /><br />=== Categories 3.0 ===<br /><br />We’ve completely redesigned the Categories screen. You can sort them to your liking or use any of the built in sorting options. We also added additional insights to the categories too as now you can check how many transactions you’ve added in that category and see how much you’ve spent or earned per category.<br /><br />=== Merge Categories ===<br /><br />You can now merge categories to your liking. If you have multiple categories for basically the same thing, you can now merge them into one. Any subcategories linked to those categories will also get merged into that new category. You can also merge subcategories within a category. Have fun!<br /><br />=== Edit Payees ===<br /><br />You can now edit all your Payees. Change the name, sort them to your liking or with the new built in sort options, this will grant more control over your financial data.<br /><br />=== Quick Note ===<br /><br />Yep, on iPad you can now add Quick Notes to any of your Transactions, Budgets and Goals. Add more details about your spending, reflect on the progress with your budget and remember why you created that goal. Quick Notes gives you a lot of flexibility and it’s just a great addition to the MoneyCoach experience.<br /><br />=== Tags ===<br />You can now add new tags, edit existing ones, delete and sort them however you want in the Settings.<br /><br />=== New Custom App Icons ===<br />We added a couple of new custom app icons requested by the community and a special one featuring our lovely robot mascot.<br /><br />=== Keyboard Navigation ===<br /><br />iPad users this is for you. You can now navigate through the app without lifting your fingers from the keyboard. Combined with the new keyboard shortcuts we added, this takes your MoneyCoach iPad experience to the next level. Mac users also benefit from this new great addition.<br /><br />=== Fixes &amp; Improvements ===<br /><br />- We improved the sorting when creating a new payee<br />- We improved the placement of the buttons in New Transaction screen<br />- We improved the CSV importing and exporting<br />- We fixed a bug that prevented you from using a newly created payee<br />- We fixed a bug that displayed the wrong localization for categories in the Settings<br />- We fixed a rare bug with the budgets<br />- We fixed a UI bug in category insights<br />- We fixed a UI bug in Personalized Goals<br /><br />We put a lot of love and care into this massive new update and we hope you like what you see. App reviews are like gold to a small app developer. If you like using the app take a minute and leave one, it helps a ton!<br /><br />If you have feedback or suggestions, please submit a support ticket from within the app. <br /><br />Best,<br />MoneyCoach team</p>

    Needs bank sync

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>If ever this app added bank sync it would be a top tier standard. As it is now it feels more like debit &amp; credit, an app I used in college &amp; about a year after graduating. It does train you to a certain mindset about expenses, but it’s easy to get behind in keeping track when all the entry is by hand. For an app that charges a $30/year sub I was surprised by the lack of web access bank connection. It’s effectively charging the cost of an app with actual AI built in (eg ability to set filters and predictive category assignment etc) but expecting the user to do all the data logging footwork.<br /><br />I suppose it appeals to those without 3+ years of records to import, but given all entries seemingly need to be individually edited it’s not ideal for those not starting from square one.<br /><br />Definitely love the concept, really really wanted to love it. Was ready to drop the $75/lifetime until I spent about 6 hours trying to fumble through all the data entry. Then realized I was working too hard to make an app work the way I wanted it to, which never works out in the long run.<br /><br />Will keep my eye on it, definitely a promising developer team and concept.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app definitely needs to add bank syncingRight now I feel like I have to do too much to keep up with my finances but there are many other apps out there that just pay synchronizing with the bank account can automatically categorize all my expenses based on the vendor so I can know and how much money I spent on groceries or car note our home expenses etc... I still have to get credit to this app because I love their interface it’s so smooth and easy for the eyes to understand what I had in front of me but I would much appreciate it if I can have my bank account sync with this account and have more automated system so I can easily set goals in budgets and the app will show me automatically based on my expenses from my bank account how much money I spent from my budget or how much money I have saved towards my goal I hope I can get a response from the developer for any further questions I’ll be happy to help. <br /><br />Marcos P.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi Marcos. Thanks a lot for this lovely review and for your support! We want to support online banking in our app, but we can&#39;t afford to offer that service at the moment as it is very costly for our small team. But it is definitely something we are looking forward for the future. Hope you understand. Have a wonderful day!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I like the app. The functionality is being built inside this app are extremely useful but it will take time to get used to using the app. I am a college student, I spend over four hours trying to navigate through the app and build your own personalize system to keep track of your spending or setting up your goal to pay college debt. I highly recommend using the tutorial to guide on building a personal system of your own to explore.<br /><br />I know this app is still currently work in progress. A few things I like to see on upcoming update are the Categories and the iCloud sync. <br />The general in the category for the expense and income always seem to update itself and I am unable to delete it. (OCD about organization)<br />iCloud sync function. I believe I am doing correctly but currently it doesn’t seem to sync through out my apple ecosystem device. I always have to update manually in each device to “sync”.</p>

are back with a big new update for MoneyCoach. \nHere’s what’s new:\n\n=== Monterey Support ===\nWe’ve updated the app to make the most out of the new things included with the macOS Monterey release. New designs, new icons, new navigation options, new materials and so much more. MoneyCoach on the Mac has never felt any better. Note that this new update is only available for devices running macOS Monterey 12.0 or later.\n\n=== Locations ===\nYes! When adding a new transaction, you can search for a location and attach it to your transaction. This is just the beginning of this feature as we have plans to expand it even more in the future with additional insights and reports based on your spending locations.\n\n=== Categories 3.0 ===\n\nWe’ve completely redesigned the Categories screen. You can sort them to your liking or use any of the built in sorting options. We also added additional insights to the categories too as now you can check how many transactions you’ve added in that category and see how much you’ve spent or earned per category.\n\n=== Merge Categories ===\n\nYou can now merge categories to your liking. If you have multiple categories for basically the same thing, you can now merge them into one. Any subcategories linked to those categories will also get merged into that new category. You can also merge subcategories within a category. Have fun!\n\n=== Edit Payees ===\n\nYou can now edit all your Payees. Change the name, sort them to your liking or with the new built in sort options, this will grant more control over your financial data.\n\n=== Quick Note ===\n\nYep, on iPad you can now add Quick Notes to any of your Transactions, Budgets and Goals. Add more details about your spending, reflect on the progress with your budget and remember why you created that goal. Quick Notes gives you a lot of flexibility and it’s just a great addition to the MoneyCoach experience.\n\n=== Tags ===\nYou can now add new tags, edit existing ones, delete and sort them however you want in the Settings.\n\n=== New Custom App Icons ===\nWe added a couple of new custom app icons requested by the community and a special one featuring our lovely robot mascot.\n\n=== Keyboard Navigation ===\n\niPad users this is for you. You can now navigate through the app without lifting your fingers from the keyboard. Combined with the new keyboard shortcuts we added, this takes your MoneyCoach iPad experience to the next level. Mac users also benefit from this new great addition.\n\n=== Fixes \u0026 Improvements ===\n\n- We improved the sorting when creating a new payee\n- We improved the placement of the buttons in New Transaction screen\n- We improved the CSV importing and exporting\n- We fixed a bug that prevented you from using a newly created payee\n- We fixed a bug that displayed the wrong localization for categories in the Settings\n- We fixed a rare bug with the budgets\n- We fixed a UI bug in category insights\n- We fixed a UI bug in Personalized Goals\n\nWe put a lot of love and care into this massive new update and we hope you like what you see.

The list is quite long so let’s get right to it.\n\n=== iOS \u0026 iPadOS 15 Design Refresh ===\n\nThe new OS versions come with lots of cool new design tweaks and improvements and we have included all of them in MoneyCoach. We redesigned many of the screens in the app with new layouts, buttons, colors, symbols, etc. and they look gorgeous. Let’s see if you can spot all of them.\n\n=== Categories 3.0 ===\n\nWe’ve completely redesigned the Categories screen. You can sort them to your liking or use any of the built in sorting options. We also added additional insights to the categories too as now you can check how many transactions you’ve added in that category and see how much you’ve spent or earned per category.\n\n=== Merge Categories ===\n\nYou can now merge categories to your liking. If you have multiple categories for basically the same thing, you can now merge them into one. Any subcategories linked to those categories will also get merged into that new category. You can also merge subcategories within a category. Have fun!\n\n=== Edit Payees ===\n\nYou can now edit all your Payees. Change the name, sort them to your liking, or with the new built-in sort options, this will grant more control over your financial data.\n\n=== Quick Note ===\n\nYep, on iPad, you can now add Quick Notes to any of your Transactions, Budgets, and Goals. Add more details about your spending, reflect on the progress with your budget and remember why you created that goal. Quick Notes gives you a lot of flexibility and it’s just a great addition to the MoneyCoach experience.\n\n=== XL Widgets ===\n\nNew beautiful XL widgets have been added to the iPad versions that offer more information about your spending habits directly on the home screen.\n\n=== Keyboard Navigation ===\n\niPad users this is for you. You can now navigate through the app without lifting your fingers from the keyboard. Combined with the new keyboard shortcuts we added, this takes your MoneyCoach iPad experience to the next level. Mac users also benefit from this new great addition.\n\n=== Watch Improved ===\n\nThe MoneyCoach Watch experience was already amazing, but we have taken it a step further. We’ve improved the design and also added support for the Always-On displays.\n\n=== New Icons ===\n\u2028We’ve added many new account icons that were requested by the community. And as usual, we’ve added a couple of new custom app icons.\n\nWe put a lot of love and care into this massive new update and we hope you like what you see.

This report is available only for devices running iOS 14 / Big Sur or later.\n\nNew Custom Icons\nThis is for all our lovely Italian users.

We also added a couple of requested account icons.\n\nInvert Colors Switch\nA couple of updates ago we inverted the colors for some Asian regions as red \u0026 green have different meanings.

Accounts are new, Budgets are new, Transactions are new, a lot things are new. MoneyCoach is more snappier and beautiful than ever.\n\n- New Branding\nAs the app evolves, the app icon has to evolve to support a global app available in multiple currencies and countries. We wanted to bring a fresh new look to MoneyCoach, a more positive approach to finances that turn green over time, now that is reflected in our new beautiful app icon. Our mascot, MON3-Y, also received an upgrade and looks really dashing.

What’s new:\n\nNew - Bulk Edit Transactions\nThis is an extremely powerful premium feature that will allow you to quickly edit the category/subcategory or account for multiple transactions in one go. Bulk editing takes the MoneyCoach experience to the next level as it grants you more control over multiple transactions at once. \n\nTap the Edit button in the Transactions list, select the transactions, and tap the ellipsis icon to quickly edit the category/subcategory or the account for these transactions.

We are super stoked to see what you think about this new powerful tool!\n\nNew - Category Search Enhanced\nIn the last update, we introduced search inside the category selection screen. Now we’ve improved it even further where if you select a category the keyboard dismisses immediately leaving space for the subcategories. There are also empty states for subcategories. On Mac, you can also Command + F to search categories. \n\nPlus, we included a switch to disable the search when the screen pops up offering more control and personalization over your MoneyCoach experience.\n\nSiri Shortcuts Enhanced\nYou can now add a custom transaction via the Siri Shortcut. Set up the shortcut either in MoneyCoach or the Shortcuts app. We also added support for more currencies when you set up and run a shortcut. It just works now.\n\nOther Enhancements\n- Added a new festive “Candy Cane” custom app icon to enjoy\n- Improved the Premium Card in the Settings and Premium Screen\n- The add description screen has predictive text\n- Added Premium Chat exclusively for Premium subscribers\n- Improved the design of the Personalized Budgets\n- Improved the MON3-Y assets and other illustrations\n- Improved the manual backup\n- Improved localizations\n\nThis was a long and difficult year for everyone and we hope we’ve helped you by creating healthy spending habits that have saved you money.\n\nMerry Christmas \u0026 Happy Holidays.

As it is now it feels more like debit \u0026 credit, an app I used in college \u0026 about a year after graduating. It does train you to a certain mindset about expenses, but it’s easy to get behind in keeping track when all the entry is by hand. For an app that charges a $30/year sub I was surprised by the lack of web access bank connection. It’s effectively charging the cost of an app with actual AI built in (eg ability to set filters and predictive category assignment etc) but expecting the user to do all the data logging footwork.\n\nI suppose it appeals to those without 3+ years of records to import, but given all entries seemingly need to be individually edited it’s not ideal for those not starting from square one.\n\nDefinitely love the concept, really really wanted to love it. Was ready to drop the $75/lifetime until I spent about 6 hours trying to fumble through all the data entry. Then realized I was working too hard to make an app work the way I wanted it to, which never works out in the long run.\n\nWill keep my eye on it, definitely a promising developer team and concept.","title":"Needs bank sync","userName":"neblotr"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6485082112","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-30T15:33:23Z","developerResponse":{"id":18280175,"body":"Hi Marcos.

However, upon starting to use the app, I found that you can’t split transactions into different categories. That’s a huge dealbreaker for me as most of the purchases I make are typically comprised of items from multiple different categories. I could go and make individual transactions for each portion of the full purchase, but I must be honest and say that’s a lot of extra work to create all of those transactions and it would just be faster for me to write it down at that point. It’d also be amazing to have the ability to link bank accounts. That’s always incredibly convenient. Overall great app, but missing some key features that I need in a budget/financial app.\n\n**Also FYI the widget didn’t work which I was really sad about because that was what made me download the app. You guys have the most useful widgets in an finance app that I’ve seen.","title":"Good, but could be better","userName":"lauragee33"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4837217840","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-09-25T19:26:55Z","developerResponse":{"id":10903477,"body":"Thanks for reporting these issues!

Thanks for fixing this.\nHowever, I am still having issues, some very minor and one I consider major.\nMinor #1: your welcome screen announcing the new release when I start the app for the first time. I click the hyperlink to view the compete list of changes and NOTHING happens.\nMinor #2: I accidentally tapped the Restore Purchases button. Instead of checking for prior purchases and telling me there are none, the app hangs until I restart it. It does try to check for prior purchases but never gives control back to me.\nMajor: I didn’t have a lot of data before downloading this update. As I said in my prior review, I had only just started using your app. BUT, once the new version was downloaded, it appears I have lost any data I had previously entered. It looks like a fresh install. If I was a longtime customer with lots of data, I would be furious right now; as it is I am more than a little concerned. Please look into what caused my data loss.\n\nOriginal Review\nI downloaded this recently and was very interested. I spent the last couple of days getting my information set up and starting to track my expenses. Today I downloaded your new update. Now the program crashes on startup.

And the more I use the app, the more features I continue to find.\n\nOne of the great things about this app is that they have a one-time payment option to purchase the app. It’s a hefty price, but it beats paying a subscription as most apps are these days. But, beyond that, this app has been fantastic when tracking my expenses.\n\nOne main feature I hope to see one day is Budget Rollover, so that whatever I end up not spending for a budget rolls over to the next week/month/year/etc., or if I spend too much then the exceeded amount rolls over to the next month.

You can sort them to your liking or use any of the built in sorting options. We also added additional insights to the categories too as now you can check how many transactions you’ve added in that category and see how much you’ve spent or earned per category.\n\n=== Merge Categories ===\n\nYou can now merge categories to your liking.
