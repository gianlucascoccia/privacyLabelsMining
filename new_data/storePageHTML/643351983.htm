Uncover a wealth of detailed stats (and bragging rights) about your days skiing and snowboarding, log your memories and replay your winter adventures with Slopes. Get the best ski tracking experience on iPhone and Apple Watch:\n\nSMART RECORDING - Hit record, then forget about it.\nSlopes automatically detects lifts and runs, just by leaving the phone in your pocket. And don't worry, Slopes is easy on the battery, so you can ride all day and it won't miss a thing. \nWith the new Smart Reminders system, Slopes can ping you if you get to a lift and hadn’t started recording yet (based on your selected resorts), or if you drive away and forgot to stop recording.\n\nDETAILED STATISTICS - Know everything about your day.\nUncover a wealth of information about your performance, so you can see exactly how you're improving season-over-season. Know your speed, vertical, run times, distance, and more. Find out how good you are and how you’re getting even better.\n\nTRAIL MAPS &amp; CONDITIONS - Your pocket guide, on and off the mountain.\nNever get lost again with access to digital trail maps right in your pocket. And before you head out, check what other riders are saying about the snow quality at a resort.\n\nFRIENDLY COMPETITIONS - A new layer of competition and fun.\nAdd your friends and compete against 8 different stats throughout the season. These leaderboards (and your account) are 100% private, so you don’t have to worry about random strangers ruining the fun.\n\nSLOPES + APPLE WATCH - Did those moguls got your heart racing? Get credit for it.\nSee how you're pushing yourself with live heart-rate data, close your activity rings, and with Slopes Premium you can check vitals and fitness insights for every twist and turn.\n\nPRIVACY-FOCUSED\nFeel secure knowing Slopes never sells your data, and features are always designed with privacy and safety in mind. Accounts are optional, and Sign-in with Apple is supported when you create one. \n\nQuestions? Feedback? Use the \"Help &amp; Support\" section in-app or visit help.getslopes.com.\n\n========================\n\nSlopes free version is ad-free and truly free. You won't waste battery, cell data, or your time on ads. And you get all the core features you expect &amp; love: unlimited tracking, key stats &amp; summaries, timeline replays on generic maps, online trail maps, snow conditions, season &amp; lifetime overviews, Siri, HealthKit, handoff, always-on display, and more.\n\nIf you’re itching for more than just your daily totals, Slopes Premium unlocks stats for every run (the full timeline view) and powerful insights into your performance:\n• Estimated data in real-time, for every run. Don't wait until you're home.\n• Winter Maps &amp; Speed Heatmaps on the timeline. Find out where you hit top speeds, which was your best run, and who was riding alongside you.\n• Fitness Insights when you record with Apple Watch - see how hard you pushed yourself at a glance.\n• Bring the mountains to life on interactive 3D &amp; AR. Works great to check what your speeds and verticals looked like.\n• Know you’ll always have a map, even without cell reception. Save offline any of the resort trail maps available in the app.\n\nIf you purchase an Annual or Family Pass, payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Your account will automatically be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period unless you disable auto-renew.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>At the start of the ski season, I tried to use Slopes, but iOS had offloaded it since I hadn’t used it during the off-season. I couldn’t get it to download again and after several tries, finally discovered that it now only works on iOS 13 and up. The developer claims you can keep using the old version, but if you have to reinstall, you can’t get the old one back. Now switching to a competitor that still supports iOS 12. As a developer myself, it’s generally a good idea to support at least the previous iOS version.<br /><br />Update: After the developer contacted me, I was able to reinstall an older version of the app. Apple did not make this easy to find. I added two more stars due to the developer’s prompt response. However, I would still like to see support for at least one iOS version back for new updates. Most apps I checked still support back to iOS 10.<br /><br />Update 2: The developer supports iOS 12 again! Greatly appreciated and definitely noticed performance improvements and less battery drain. Thanks again for making this change!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hey Starkiller, you can totally still use it with the 6 (since you previously downloaded it)! Apple just doesn&#39;t make that 100% clear how. In the App Store go to the Updates tab, and you&#39;ll see the &quot;Purchased&quot; option at the top. Hit that and find Slopes in the list. Apple lets you download older versions of apps as long as the developer approves it. I made sure to keep a version around for people on 12. I&#39;ve got ya covered. <br /><br />Update: I went ahead and put in a lot of work to retrofit iOS 12 support into Slopes, meeting your request to support one version older of iOS. Hope you enjoy all the new goodies!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Fantastic app for any skiers/snowboarders looking to track their day on the slopes. The data the app gives even without the premium pass is still very cool and helpful. You can view your top speed, longest run length, a timeline of all lift rides and runs with an animation on a 2D map, etc. <br /><br />The premium pass somehow makes it 10x better, with precise lift and run times for each run, instantaneous speeds on any run, a 3D google-earth like view of your day on the slopes, a graph with your heart rate and speed along the timeline, and many other things that would take too long to list here. I would HIGHLY recommend this app, and if you can afford the premium pass, even just for a day or a single trip, I would also highly recommend it. <br /><br />The only issue I have had with the app is the last 90 min of one of my days not recording, which I think was due to me accidentally force closing the app; otherwise, it is absolute 🔥. I almost never write reviews, but this app deserved my time. (Which should tell y’all something)</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I give a 5 star. I was gifted an Apple Watch for Christmas and have been recording as many days on snow as I can. (So far iv got 28 days, 258runs) I really enjoy being able to look back at my day and see each run, even with the free version. I am however very forgetful and sometimes forget to stop the recording and the app records my ride home as a result. I know I can edit those out with the features provided. I wish there was a way for the app to be able to recognize when iv left the resort, and am on main roads, so that an auto stop would activate and auto log while I’m driving. I get that that’s asking a lot for someone who’s lazy and just forgetting to simply hit stop, but i think, in my opinion, that it would make the app better. You’ve already improved in so many ways since the 26th of dec. and I thank you for that! Thank you for a lock, the stop without pause, and the safety features for glade trials.</p>

It has a bit of personality now, showing either a skier or a snowboarder based on what you recorded last. And it'll much better match your watch face if you use custom color tinting.\n- Added a little bit of \"fanning\" for friend avatars on the premium maps, making it easier to see who is where when you have a stack of friends all together.\n- Added support for the new Pro Motion playback on the timeline screen on iPhone 13 Pros.\n- Added an alert if you try to enable Smart Reminders but you had previously denied Slopes permission to send notifications (usually why you'd toggle them on and then the switch would revert to off right away).\n- Fixed the run comparisons not using speed heatmaps.\n- Fixed case on iPad where photos displayed on premium maps wouldn't completely clear when switching activities.","releaseDate":"2021-10-21"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.13","releaseNotes":"This app has been updated by Apple to display the Apple Watch app icon.\n\n- Smart Reminders. Oh boy I've been trying to crack this nut forever. Slopes can now ping you if you drive away and forgot to stop recording, or if you get to a lift and you hadn’t started recording yet (among other things).\n    - You enable Smart Reminders on the device you record with, either your Watch or your iPhone.\n    - You can enable these reminders for up to 12 resorts. When you get to one of the resorts you’ve enabled them for, you’ll get a welcome notification. Tap it to launch Slopes really quick to make sure the lift reminders are good to go for your first day there.\n    - For any resort you don’t add ahead of time, Slopes will enable all these reminders once you start recording there. So basically, you just miss out on the lift-based start recording reminders the first day if you just let Slopes do its thing.\n    - This new system fixes the annoyance with the old reminder system where you’d get pings to record even when you were already recording.\n    - All this happens without Slopes needing to run into the background and spy on your location.\n    - Smart reminders works on all version of iOS, but requires today’s new watchOS to work on Watch.\n- Adds support for the always-on display on Apple Watch when using the new version of watchOS.\n- Also new for Apple Watch, the graph of vertical / speed / etc for the most recent 5 runs has been replaced with a heart rate graph while you're recording. I’m always curious when I’m hiking up Peak 8 at Breck where my heart rate is at compared to riding a groomer, and I was really annoyed Slopes didn’t show me this. It'll show the last hour of your heart rate, so it is easy to go back and look after you make it to the bottom.\n- The stat graphs might be gone, but whichever stat you have as your focus (rotate the Digital Crown) will now show an arrow to indicate which of your most recent run was better/worse vs the previous. Much easier to glance, and really that was the point of the graphs anyway.\n- The resort condition and forecast widgets support the new intelligent widget suggestions. This means if you check the conditions at your favorite resort every day at 8am, the Smart Stack widget in the new iOS should start recommending the conditions widget even if you haven’t added it manually yet.\n- The conditions widget also supports the new relevance scores, so the system knows a powder day is important and to highlight the widget when in a stack.\n- Fixed a case where 3d mountains on the daily summary might pop in without trees.\n- You should see some smaller speed improvements with premium maps on iPad and macOS.\n- The usual round of small UI polish and improvements throughout the app.\n- Finally, support for iOS 13 and watchOS 6 has been dropped (remember that if you need to you can go to your purchase history in the App Store to download Slopes on older versions of iOS).","releaseDate":"2021-09-20"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.12","releaseNotes":"- Fixed the share button on the activity screen.","releaseDate":"2021-07-21"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.11","releaseNotes":"- Fixed a crash when linking Slopes and Strava accounts.\n- Fixed a crash when displaying photos on the timeline map.","releaseDate":"2021-07-18"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.10","releaseNotes":"- Fixed an issue where some popup sheets would jump to the top of the screen if you triggered a second popup over top of the original.","releaseDate":"2021-06-30"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.9","releaseNotes":"- Fixed Voice Over support for tagging conditions on the record completion screen.\n- Fixed a case where 3D mountains would have the camera pointed backwards looking away from the mountain.","releaseDate":"2021-06-16"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.8","releaseNotes":"- Improved the Household Pass onboarding, making the process easier to invite people to join your household after purchase.\n- Updated the Household Pass to work with Apple's Family Sharing (and as a result now supports up to 5 other members). It still works cross-platform, too.\n- Improved how Slopes saves to Apple Health, letting apps like HealthFit more easily separate lift time vs idle time (this will apply to new recordings, not retroactive).\n- Fixed an issue with the heat map of your visits during a season not initially rendering on the share card generator.","releaseDate":"2021-04-16"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.7","releaseNotes":"- New automatic merging. Slopes has had the option to manually merge two or more recordings from the same day (and it'd do it automatically for Watch recordings). But now, instead of worrying about merging at all, Slopes will just display multiple recordings like this as one in the UI automatically. There's some smarts to it, like it won't group together 2 activities from the same day if they are more than 3 miles apart. This fixes all bugs related to the old merging system since nothing is actually merged anymore!\n- Added workout routes to Apple Health saves, so new activities will have their GPS data added to Apple Health. Note: a full day of skiing has 100KB to 300KB worth of GPS data, so a dozen days per season = 2 to 4 photos from your camera. Most of you don't have to worry about a thing, but if you record 50+ days per year that might add up over the years. You can always turn route saving off in Apple's Health app under Slopes's permissions.","releaseDate":"2021-03-23"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.6","releaseNotes":"- Added Russian translation, the second language to be brought to you by other Slopes users (thanks lisachev and petr.kashlikov!)\n- Improvements to the UX when using PayPal via iTunes and those countries in Europe with a new two-step checkout process in iTunes.

These zoom options work in both 2D and 3D modes.\n    - AR mode is now triggered from the timeline screen.\n- Season and Trip summary screens have also been reorganized, and now always include maps of where you went.\n- The More tab is gone, and the important items from there like settings have been consolidated into the Account tab. Lots of people never thought to tap on More to find things, turns out.\n- Added support for iOS 13.4's pointer interactions if you have an iPad + trackpad.\n- Added an Add to Siri button on the

These leaderboards (and your account) are 100% private, so you don’t have to worry about random strangers ruining the fun.\n\nSLOPES + APPLE WATCH - Did those moguls got your heart racing? Get credit for it.\nSee how you're pushing yourself with live heart-rate data, close your activity rings, and with Slopes Premium you can check vitals and fitness insights for every twist and turn.\n\nPRIVACY-FOCUSED\nFeel secure knowing Slopes never sells your data, and features are always designed with privacy and safety in mind.

I couldn’t get it to download again and after several tries, finally discovered that it now only works on iOS 13 and up. The developer claims you can keep using the old version, but if you have to reinstall, you can’t get the old one back. Now switching to a competitor that still supports iOS 12. As a developer myself, it’s generally a good idea to support at least the previous iOS version.\n\nUpdate: After the developer contacted me, I was able to reinstall an older version of the app. Apple did not make this easy to find. I added two more stars due to the developer’s prompt response. However, I would still like to see support for at least one iOS version back for new updates. Most apps I checked still support back to iOS 10.\n\nUpdate 2: The developer supports iOS 12 again! Greatly appreciated and definitely noticed performance improvements and less battery drain.

The data the app gives even without the premium pass is still very cool and helpful. You can view your top speed, longest run length, a timeline of all lift rides and runs with an animation on a 2D map, etc. \n\nThe premium pass somehow makes it 10x better, with precise lift and run times for each run, instantaneous speeds on any run, a 3D google-earth like view of your day on the slopes, a graph with your heart rate and speed along the timeline, and many other things that would take too long to list here. I would HIGHLY recommend this app, and if you can afford the premium pass, even just for a day or a single trip, I would also highly recommend it. \n\nThe only issue I have had with the app is the last 90 min of one of my days not recording, which I think was due to me accidentally force closing the app; otherwise, it is absolute 🔥.

I wish there was a way for the app to be able to recognize when iv left the resort, and am on main roads, so that an auto stop would activate and auto log while I’m driving. I get that that’s asking a lot for someone who’s lazy and just forgetting to simply hit stop, but i think, in my opinion, that it would make the app better.

I’m not a premium subscriber yet as my main riding partner is in a cast and I won’t be going to any big resorts this year, but I am looking forward to using my day pass to try out the features. \n\nMy one complaint, and this may just be with my Watch itself, is that the Siri integration for Slopes doesn’t work on it. I say “hey Siri, start snowboarding” and the Fitness app pops up. It works fine on my phone, but not on the Watch.

It got my exact times (times Myself with atop watch) shows you any wipeouts, slowdowns, speeds, and everything you cAn think of. It shows you very single run in 3D mode, and even a satellite view of the mountain, showing exactly on the trail you were at, showing all your turns. That one is a paid feature, but with all the amazing paid features I recommend getting a one day pass. I don't ski often, so it's totally worth it.

It’s good, but there is a lot that can be improved. I would rate it more positively if there were reviews for every run. Let’s say, the top speed, distance, average speed, and time for every trail you ski or ride. Also, the time on the chairlift and lift line time (as well as other breaks) are added into your average speed. This doesn’t bother me much, but when comparing with friends who use other apps, I always have a speed of around 3 mph when they have averages of 24 mph. Some apps I’ve used (which have [sadly] been taken out of the App Store) recorded numbers of jumps and names of trails. When talking with friends today on the lifts, we decided that the app should totally show the names of the trails you skied and have trail maps readily available. Along with the maps, I always wished the app would show which trails were closed, and which chairlifts were running. Other than these suggestions, the app is great!!

The mapping is also amazing, you can see each of the runs you did and the lifts you used. I was also amazing at just how far and high we skied. You would think that the gps recording and speed tracking takes a toll on your battery. It turns out it didn’t really at all! The app uses the gps and speed stats from the Apple health trackers and it’s relatively energy efficient. I started at 89% and on low power mode, with a bit of snap chatting and phone calling my phone dropped to only 56%.

My only request would be that you can view a trail map of the resort as one of the map layer options when you view your run details. Right now you can only view in winter or satellite layer. I’ve also noticed that some resort maps are only a portion of the resort and not the entire resort. Overall, I think it’s an awesome app and am grateful for all the new updates every season.

The \"account required\" flow is a bit nicer now.\n- Improved keyboard support for menus and popups on iPad.\n- Updated translations for Dutch (thanks minelli1959!).\n- Added options under your account to change what kind of emails Slopes can send you.\n- Fixed a crash on iOS 14 when viewing the map of your day.\n- Fixed icons sometimes not showing on the premium maps on iPad.","releaseDate":"2021-11-04"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.14","releaseNotes":"- While I as fixing an issue with Slopes's complications not showing on watchOS 8 (sorry!), I ended up spending an extra 2 days down the rabbit hole of completely redesigning and rebuilding it with a more modern style. It has a bit of personality now, showing either a skier or a snowboarder based on what you recorded last. And it'll much better match your watch face if you use custom color tinting.\n- Added a little bit of \"fanning\" for friend avatars on the premium maps, making it easier to see who is where when you have a stack of friends all together.\n- Added support for the new Pro Motion playback on the timeline screen on iPhone 13 Pros.\n- Added an alert if you try to enable Smart Reminders but you had previously denied Slopes permission to send notifications (usually why you'd toggle them on and then the switch would revert to off right away).\n- Fixed the run comparisons not using speed heatmaps.\n- Fixed case on iPad where photos displayed on premium maps wouldn't completely clear when switching activities.","releaseDate":"2021-10-21"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.13","releaseNotes":"This app has been updated by Apple to display the Apple Watch app icon.\n\n- Smart Reminders. Oh boy I've been trying to crack this nut forever. Slopes can now ping you if you drive away and forgot to stop recording, or if you get to a lift and you hadn’t started recording yet (among other things).\n    - You enable Smart Reminders on the device you record with, either your Watch or your iPhone.\n    - You can enable these reminders for up to 12 resorts. When you get to one of the resorts you’ve enabled them for, you’ll get a welcome notification. Tap it to launch Slopes really quick to make sure the lift reminders are good to go for your first day there.\n    - For any resort you don’t add ahead of time, Slopes will enable all these reminders once you start recording there. So basically, you just miss out on the lift-based start recording reminders the first day if you just let Slopes do its thing.\n    - This new system fixes the annoyance with the old reminder system where you’d get pings to record even when you were already recording.\n    - All this happens without Slopes needing to run into the background and spy on your location.\n    - Smart reminders works on all version of iOS, but requires today’s new watchOS to work on Watch.\n- Adds support for the always-on display on Apple Watch when using the new version of watchOS.\n- Also new for Apple Watch, the graph of vertical / speed / etc for the most recent 5 runs has been replaced with a heart rate graph while you're recording. I’m always curious when I’m hiking up Peak 8 at Breck where my heart rate is at compared to riding a groomer, and I was really annoyed Slopes didn’t show me this. It'll show the last hour of your heart rate, so it is easy to go back and look after you make it to the bottom.\n- The stat graphs might be gone, but whichever stat you have as your focus (rotate the Digital Crown) will now show an arrow to indicate which of your most recent run was better/worse vs the previous. Much easier to glance, and really that was the point of the graphs anyway.\n- The resort condition and forecast widgets support the new intelligent widget suggestions. This means if you check the conditions at your favorite resort every day at 8am, the Smart Stack widget in the new iOS should start recommending the conditions widget even if you haven’t added it manually yet.\n- The conditions widget also supports the new relevance scores, so the system knows a powder day is important and to highlight the widget when in a stack.\n- Fixed a case where 3d mountains on the daily summary might pop in without trees.\n- You should see some smaller speed improvements with premium maps on iPad and macOS.\n- The usual round of small UI polish and improvements throughout the app.\n- Finally, support for iOS 13 and watchOS 6 has been dropped (remember that if you need to you can go to your purchase history in the App Store to download Slopes on older versions of iOS).","releaseDate":"2021-09-20"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.12","releaseNotes":"- Fixed the share button on the activity screen.","releaseDate":"2021-07-21"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.11","releaseNotes":"- Fixed a crash when linking Slopes and Strava accounts.\n- Fixed a crash when displaying photos on the timeline map.","releaseDate":"2021-07-18"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.10","releaseNotes":"- Fixed an issue where some popup sheets would jump to the top of the screen if you triggered a second popup over top of the original.","releaseDate":"2021-06-30"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.9","releaseNotes":"- Fixed Voice Over support for tagging conditions on the record completion screen.\n- Fixed a case where 3D mountains would have the camera pointed backwards looking away from the mountain.","releaseDate":"2021-06-16"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.8","releaseNotes":"- Improved the Household Pass onboarding, making the process easier to invite people to join your household after purchase.\n- Updated the Household Pass to work with Apple's Family Sharing (and as a result now supports up to 5 other members). It still works cross-platform, too.\n- Improved how Slopes saves to Apple Health, letting apps like HealthFit more easily separate lift time vs idle time (this will apply to new recordings, not retroactive).\n- Fixed an issue with the heat map of your visits during a season not initially rendering on the share card generator.","releaseDate":"2021-04-16"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.7","releaseNotes":"- New automatic merging. Slopes has had the option to manually merge two or more recordings from the same day (and it'd do it automatically for Watch recordings). But now, instead of worrying about merging at all, Slopes will just display multiple recordings like this as one in the UI automatically. There's some smarts to it, like it won't group together 2 activities from the same day if they are more than 3 miles apart. This fixes all bugs related to the old merging system since nothing is actually merged anymore!\n- Added workout routes to Apple Health saves, so new activities will have their GPS data added to Apple Health. Note: a full day of skiing has 100KB to 300KB worth of GPS data, so a dozen days per season = 2 to 4 photos from your camera. Most of you don't have to worry about a thing, but if you record 50+ days per year that might add up over the years. You can always turn route saving off in Apple's Health app under Slopes's permissions.","releaseDate":"2021-03-23"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.6","releaseNotes":"- Added Russian translation, the second language to be brought to you by other Slopes users (thanks lisachev and petr.kashlikov!)\n- Improvements to the UX when using PayPal via iTunes and those countries in Europe with a new two-step checkout process in iTunes. Slopes won't incorrectly report an error when there was actually wasn't one.\n- Dug through the customer support emails for this season and made improvements based on common confusions:\n    - You can now remove friends via the friends tab too (icon in top right brings up option).\n    - Added a message if you have Slopes Cloud Backup turned off that lets you know you can't participate in the stat comparisons with friends (no data on the server).\n    - Promoted two FAQs up to the main help screen.\n    - Tweaked some labels to make some buttons / options clearer.\n    - Added some other new FAQs and rewrote some existing ones to be clearer / more helpful.\n- My help provider, HelpScout, has made some nice improvements to their in-app help system over the year. So now launching into that when you view an FAQ instead of the web interface.\n- Fixed an issue on the summary screen where the red / black / gray dots could be way, way, too big.\n- Server-side fix, but fixed the case where the \"recent change\" green arrows on the friends tab would stick around longer than 2 weeks.\n- Fixed two missing icons on the compare run screen.","releaseDate":"2021-02-18"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.5","releaseNotes":"- Fixed crash on Apple Watch related to permissions.","releaseDate":"2021-02-06"},{"versionDisplay":"2021.4","releaseNotes":"- Quick fix to fix adding/removing friends.\n\nWhat's new in 2021.3:\n\nSlopes is partnering with Protect Our Winters to ensure winter sports stay around for future generations. 2% of Slopes's 2020 revenue is being donated, and Slopes will continue to donate 2% of purchases going forward.

Lots of people never thought to tap on More to find things, turns out.\n- Added support for iOS 13.4's pointer interactions if you have an iPad + trackpad.\n- Added an Add to Siri button on the summary screen for starting skiing hands-free.\n- Added a little weight/inertia to 3D mountains when you move them around.\n- You can now permanently dismiss the prompt asking if you want to display photos from your photo library.\n- Massive improvement to the smoothness of user avatars moving on maps during playback / scrolling of the timeline.\n- Fixed off-piste / backcountry recordings sometimes being changed to \"Unlisted Resort\" after saving.\n- Fixed an issue on the timeline screen where starting/stopping playback multiple times would cause playback to speed up.\n- Fixed a case where at smaller resorts playback would happen too fast on the timeline screen.\n\nStay safe y'all.","releaseDate":"2020-05-05"}],"languageList":["English","Afrikaans","Danish","Dutch","French","Georgian","German","Hebrew","Italian","Japanese","Korean","Norwegian Bokmål","Polish","Portuguese","Russian","Slovenian","Spanish","Turkish"],"messagesScreenshots":{"ipadPro_2018":[{"width":2048,"height":2732,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/a6/df/b7/a6dfb7cb-3503-0f0d-b54d-65c14f7727fe/51d2b6df-b980-424d-8cdb-22928ac575e0_ipadPro129.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"0f3a14","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"3f6143"}],"iphone_6_5":[{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/9f/da/d6/9fdad64c-66d2-8cca-9fa4-0f9e96b95750/281a0419-31a7-4474-b720-ca7b9d71a141_6.5__U0028XR__U0026_Max_U0029_-_iMessages.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f9f9f9","textColor1":"0b0b0b","textColor2":"202045","textColor3":"3b3b3b","textColor4":"4b4b69"}],"ipadPro":[{"width":2048,"height":2732,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/45/9a/4b/459a4b6e-2696-8247-4f31-c36f0ab98a48/637c1933-c60c-406f-b6e1-7e668eccb3a9_iPad.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"0f3a14","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"3f6143"}],"iphone6+":[{"width":1242,"height":2208,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/06/6f/c9/066fc9e0-5f65-99ce-2e58-244533b9fa6d/f43fcf5d-7416-416f-a8af-af6715e95228_5.5__U0028Plus_U0029_-_iMessages.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f9f9f9","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"4e0000","textColor3":"323232","textColor4":"703131"}]},"privacyPolicyUrl":"https://getslopes.com/data.html","requirementsString":"Requires iOS 14.1 and watchOS 7.1 or later.
