        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Waking Up is not just another meditation app—and now our bold new look and feel informs that reality. We’re excited to announce the app has been fully reimagined and redesigned. <br /><br />First of all, we’ve collaborated with dozens of artists—known and unknown—from around the world. They were chosen because they reflect the depth, thoughtfulness, and quality of our content (think modern art meets legendary album covers). We’ve also created a new logo that will give us a better frame for our Daily Heads—and, as you’ll see, this will allow for some very cool collaborations with outside artists in the future. <br /><br />Next, we’ve continued to feature even more meditation teachers, scientists, and scholars. They’re helping us pressure-test the ancient wisdom we’re committed to decoding and sharing. As always, our goal is to invoke a radical shift in perspective using the best minds in the world to do it. This includes more series and lessons on a diverse range of philosophies and practices—from Stoicism, Zen, walking meditations, and a brand-new “SOS” practice series that features emergency meditations for life’s crisis moments. Also, we’ve added new conversations and sessions with such luminaries as Joseph Goldstein on the Buddhist meditation path, James Fadiman on psychedelics and the self, the incandescent poetry of David Whyte, and the compassionate wisdom of Tara Brach. We have many new series in development. <br /><br />Finally, we’ve refined our navigation for a cleaner and more intuitive way to explore our library. This includes descriptions of every meditation, lesson, and conversation in the app, so you can easily find what you’re looking for. <br /><br />Whether you’re a beginning or advanced meditator, Waking Up opens the door to a deeper understanding of yourself—and a new way of being in the world. <br /><br />Thank you for your practice, and enjoy the app. </p>

    I could cry at how much Sam Harris and this app has changed my life
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I first discovered Sam Harris through his podcast, Making Sense, which is still my favorite podcast of all time. And I remember when he announced he’d be coming out with this app and at first, I didn’t use it. I was already using Headspace for over a year and didn’t feel the need. Then I tried it once and felt this immediate click, this light: “This is the kind of practice I’ve been looking for.” I’ve been using Waking Up ever since. I remember trying the first-offered longer introductory course and after each session, I swear I said “whoa.” Not because I felt like I was in another state, but I felt closer to “myself” and others, bit by bit, each session. I felt less insecure, less anxious, less angry, less anticipatory, less critical, bit by bit, each session. And this continues to be true. Sam, I wish I could look you in the eyes and tell you this in person: This app and your podcast have made me a better person. My interactions feel lighter. I am less self critical. I am less reactive. I am a better critical thinker. Your work pushes those who listen over and through the walls we put up, the walls created by childhood, by fear, by habit, by politics, by culture. I don’t know how to thank you and don’t think I ever will. I will end with this: This app is for everyone. Even if this way of thinking and practicing is totally new to you, try it. Just try it. Give it a shot. You won’t regret it.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Sam, this is great. I’ve done maybe a few dozen hours of pure meditation over all. Ranging from 5 minute sessions to upwards of 2 hours at a time. I’ve read probably more than the average amount of material on meditation in general with no specific method at the forefront and the way you explain the experience and how to get there is identical to the lane I found best as I was figuring it out on my own. You’ve both reassured my current understanding of at least the begging stages of meditation and it’s always comforting to hear that we’re not trying to stop our thoughts more so recognize them and experiences them while not losing track of ourselves. I have some thoughts and questions on the breath being the forefront of meditation but ultimately have my doubts that it’s the perfect tool that most practicing meditators use. I think we can do better and I have to assume you take us there in this corse because if I have to spend one more second concentrating on my breath I’m going to phyciclyy implode. Again, thank you. <br /><br />Just a special note: I’ve followed your career and your work over the years, I’ve read your books, and listen to your podcast religiously. I can’t help but consider you a friend in spirit. And I’d like to offer my thanks to you for being a source of reason in the times of my life that I could find none face to face. You’ve helped me tremendously...just in case you needed reminding that you are helping people.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>We live in despondent times, or so it seems. In these times more than any, there is an tendency to look inwards and when this inward seeking is constantly interrupted by our small self, which assures us there is no there-there and to get on with your life. A lot of my forays in to this enquiry had this character, leaving me more jaded for the effort. <br />Many have wondered and tried to come up with a way of illuminating this path. There seems to me a fundamental problem with using traditional communication, for what it communicated is not for the conceptual mind. Hence when we grasp these ideas through this small mind, there is just exasperation. The aim of true teaching is to awaken the teacher in each one of us. Plant a seed of curiosity in one’ mind and be there to help guide with the subsequent unraveling. If someone suggested this can be achieved with a digital medium in the form of a smart phone app, literally everyone in the world will find it silly. Sam Harris thankfully is not one of them and for that I Thank him(I wish there is a way to express the amplitude behind that Thanks, but my grasp of English is sadly inadequate). <br />My hope for writing this review is to see it can help to make this tool available for few or at least one other explorer, who has the character of not willing to surrender his/her intellect, but still willing to explore the idea of non-dualism which rings true to him/her.</p>

They were chosen because they reflect the depth, thoughtfulness, and quality of our content (think modern art meets legendary album covers). We’ve also created a new logo that will give us a better frame for our Daily Heads—and, as you’ll see, this will allow for some very cool collaborations with outside artists in the future. \n\nNext, we’ve continued to feature even more meditation teachers, scientists, and scholars. They’re helping us pressure-test the ancient wisdom we’re committed to decoding and sharing. As always, our goal is to invoke a radical shift in perspective using the best minds in the world to do it. This includes more series and lessons on a diverse range of philosophies and practices—from Stoicism, Zen, walking meditations, and a brand-new “SOS” practice series that features emergency meditations for life’s crisis moments. Also, we’ve added new conversations and sessions with such luminaries as Joseph Goldstein on the Buddhist meditation path, James Fadiman on psychedelics and the self, the incandescent poetry of David Whyte, and the compassionate wisdom of Tara Brach. We have many new series in development. \n\nFinally, we’ve refined our navigation for a cleaner and more intuitive way to explore our library. This includes descriptions of every meditation, lesson, and conversation in the app, so you can easily find what you’re looking for. \n\nWhether you’re a beginning or advanced meditator, Waking Up opens the door to a deeper understanding of yourself—and a new way of being in the world. \n\nThank you for your practice, and enjoy the app. ","releaseDate":"2021-11-04"},{"versionDisplay":"2.0","releaseNotes":"Waking Up is not just another meditation app—and now our bold new look and feel informs that reality.

Then I tried it once and felt this immediate click, this light: “This is the kind of practice I’ve been looking for.” I’ve been using Waking Up ever since. I remember trying the first-offered longer introductory course and after each session, I swear I said “whoa.” Not because I felt like I was in another state, but I felt closer to “myself” and others, bit by bit, each session. I felt less insecure, less anxious, less angry, less anticipatory, less critical, bit by bit, each session. And this continues to be true. Sam, I wish I could look you in the eyes and tell you this in person: This app and your podcast have made me a better person. My interactions feel lighter. I am less self critical. I am less reactive. I am a better critical thinker. Your work pushes those who listen over and through the walls we put up, the walls created by childhood, by fear, by habit, by politics, by culture. I don’t know how to thank you and don’t think I ever will. I will end with this: This app is for everyone. Even if this way of thinking and practicing is totally new to you, try it. Just try it. Give it a shot. You won’t regret it.","title":"I could cry at how much Sam Harris and this app has changed my life","userName":"Alana Herlands"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4786601763","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-09-15T19:40:22Z","rating":5,"review":"Sam, this is great. I’ve done maybe a few dozen hours of pure meditation over all. Ranging from 5 minute sessions to upwards of 2 hours at a time. I’ve read probably more than the average amount of material on meditation in general with no specific method at the forefront and the way you explain the experience and how to get there is identical to the lane I found best as I was figuring it out on my own. You’ve both reassured my current understanding of at least the begging stages of meditation and it’s always comforting to hear that we’re not trying to stop our thoughts more so recognize them and experiences them while not losing track of ourselves. I have some thoughts and questions on the breath being the forefront of meditation but ultimately have my doubts that it’s the perfect tool that most practicing meditators use. I think we can do better and I have to assume you take us there in this corse because if I have to spend one more second concentrating on my breath I’m going to phyciclyy implode. Again, thank you. \n\nJust a special note: I’ve followed your career and your work over the years, I’ve read your books, and listen to your podcast religiously. I can’t help but consider you a friend in spirit. And I’d like to offer my thanks to you for being a source of reason in the times of my life that I could find none face to face.

In these times more than any, there is an tendency to look inwards and when this inward seeking is constantly interrupted by our small self, which assures us there is no there-there and to get on with your life. A lot of my forays in to this enquiry had this character, leaving me more jaded for the effort. \nMany have wondered and tried to come up with a way of illuminating this path. There seems to me a fundamental problem with using traditional communication, for what it communicated is not for the conceptual mind. Hence when we grasp these ideas through this small mind, there is just exasperation. The aim of true teaching is to awaken the teacher in each one of us. Plant a seed of curiosity in one’ mind and be there to help guide with the subsequent unraveling. If someone suggested this can be achieved with a digital medium in the form of a smart phone app, literally everyone in the world will find it silly. Sam Harris thankfully is not one of them and for that I Thank him(I wish there is a way to express the amplitude behind that Thanks, but my grasp of English is sadly inadequate). \nMy hope for writing this review is to see it can help to make this tool available for few or at least one other explorer, who has the character of not willing to surrender his/her intellect, but still willing to explore the idea of non-dualism which rings true to him/her.","title":"Thank you!

However, each meditation being disconnected and by a different person made me eventually feel drawn to this course after hearing from a friend how helpful she was finding it to be. I’m only five days in and I already can feel how much deeper I’m getting. These practices really do layer and build together in important ways that I was missing before. I really appreciate having a specific meditation to do each morning rather than starting the day scrolling through options trying to choose between too many choices and sometimes changing my mind mid way through. I also have been benefiting a lot from the theory talks that I listen to during moments throughout my day. It helps integrate the practice with daily life and create the scaffolding for deeper understanding. It’s so nice being able to favorite and download these too for offline use. Overall feeling a lot of gratitude for all the thoughtfulness put into this course and all I am receiving from it. I truly believe that each of us doing the inner work to train our minds and respond rather than react to each other and the world around us is crucial to the meeting problems we are collectively facing.

The best way I can describe it is that I feel that I am more able to notice my thoughts and feelings in the present moment. How I suddenly find myself playing in a drama in the theater of my mind. Sam Harris is able to teach you how to notice the dramas, rather than getting lost in them for long periods of time. As I become more observant of my mind, I feel Iike I have more control over my mind. Sam Harris explains his insights in a way that challenges you. But when you come to understand it what he’s saying, you feel like you “wake up” from tendencies that we’re holding you back. Like lucid dreaming feels (gaining control during a dream) waking up has made me feel like I am gradually lucid living. I find myself enjoying the moment more, short circuiting thoughts and feelings but feeling them more powerfully, and ultimately appreciating my life so much more. I initially was skeptical of mediation but Sam Harris does such an excellent job of explaining his message in a way that you eventually understand. The effects of this practice are indescribably priceless. I’m achieving things I didn’t think I could achieve. I enjoy everything about my life more and more as I continue to wake up. Thanks for helping me grow Sam.

I understood what I was supposed to do (focus on the breath, not attach myself to thoughts), but I didn’t understand WHY I was doing these specific things. This app is completely different. It delves fully into the theory behind meditation. Not just it’s measurable benefits, like improved focus or reduced stress, but it also goes into the higher-level purpose of the practice, like realizing the illusion of the ego and giving yourself a whole new perspective on every situation you encounter in life. If one was not interested in this kind of theory, he/she could definitely just use the app for practice alone, but the theory section of the app as well as the little bits of theory interspersed throughout the guided sessions help me TREMENDOUSLY. This really keeps me motivated, because it shows me that if I commit to spending time with the practice, my outlook on life is going to change in so many positive ways. And it has! I’ve been meditating for almost 2 months now and I feel less stressed, less reactive to negative emotions and inconvenient events in life, and more positive overall. That being said, I can tell I still have SO much more room to grow with the practice, and I hope to continue on for a lifetime. Thank you so much for waking me up, Sam Harris.

I tried apps and various teachers , monks guided meditations with the same results. I am a big fan of Sam’s work in general , his books and podcast,  and feel that he brought an immense level of detail to this course. It is well thought out and structured, he gradually introduces you to various concepts and ways of thinking/perceiving the meditation. he is filing in blindness spots, that you are not yet aware of, along the way. No day is the same in the app, and each lesson challenges you in a different way. You can also deepen your experience through additional provided exercises. I’m on day 24 so far, which is the longest streak for me, and while many concepts still seem hard to grasp , i look forward to coming lessons. And it does feel incredible already to sense the time slower and your own nature and reactions differently.

And this is saying a lot, considering the knee jerk reactions to daily life which nearly all of us consistently trip over, time and time again. This increase in absense mostly takes the form of our phone hypnosis, even amongst those of us who have noticed that putting our phone away while eating, or spending time with family, or friends, is “polite”, and necessary to being present.  Despite this, how useful, really, is our time spent staring into the screen? And how often do we do this?\nI have found this meditation course one of increasing utility, wisdom, and sense making, amazingly packaged within the very device which blankets and obscures these positive aforementioned qualities. One of the few times in my day when picking up my phone increases the quality of my life, truly. And it’s quite likely because as soon as I pick my phone up, and start the next lesson, I just as quickly put it down, close my eyes, and begin browsing, or becoming mindful of the unceasing browsing in the one actual reality that actually matters most. Thanks Sam. Though I love podcasts, and opinions, and moral and political and psychological debate; talk, really, is cheap.

At first, I kept him at an arm’s length, only doing a session of the waking up course once every other day. I applied his teachings to every moment I could, starting with every bite of food. On day 27, I was having a bit of a mind-blowing psychedelic experience. 8 hours in, I got a tad bit lost... in thought. Wait! I need Sam! I exclaimed. And so I did my guided meditation practice with my friend Sam, who was there for me. He instructed me to, upon his snapping, look inward at the meditator. I kept drawing a blank at this concept. “Ah I see what you’re doing Sam, I get it!” I said to him. He continued to snap, which quite literally snapped me back into reality. “C’mon Sam!” I said, reluctant to return to reality. Eventually, I accepted it, went along, and returned to the present moment, where I would rest peacefully and happily. The next day, my sister and my grandmother recognized me as an adult, and noticed that my already few symptoms of Asperger’s Syndrome stopped presenting themselves in the ways that my family recognized them. I then went on to complete the waking up course the next day, and I think I’ll keep coming back so long as there’s internet! Thanks Sam!

It can change the way you think and process the world. The guided meditation courses will teach you all you need to know to meditate on your own but the conversation topics are what really blew me away and challenged my thinking the most. The things I’ve learned from Sam Harris have helped me manage my anxiety during very uncertain times. But beyond the benefits of the app itself, I was moved immensely by the kindness of the people on the Waking Up support team. When my app needed to be renewed I didn’t have extra funds at the time but the global news was incredibly bleak and I could feel my anxiety creeping back in with scary force. I reached out in hopes of getting a trial that I could use for a month or two to bring mindfulness back into my life and they responded in a matter of moments saying that they added a full year to my account for free. I have truly never had a company think about my well-being over their own profit. It blew me away and I’m still quite shocked. This isn’t just a business for them, it’s a way of life and they are walking the walk not just talking the talk.
