    Getting Better With Every Update

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I bought Aviary when it first came out. I was excited for the potential and the features that were being added. Initially it was difficult to use. The feature was there but the app was still early days and still had some rough edges.<br /><br />For the past month or so, however, Aviary has become my daily driver for Twitter on my phone. It runs more smoothly and the rough edges are being cleaned up with each update. On top of that the feature set is unparalleled among third party Twitter clients. There are still occasional crashes, but the developer is quick to correct. All told it’s a solid app that I only expect to get better.</p>

    A Twitter Client With Taste
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>When an app like this comes along you always expect a standard of what it does, this app far exceeds that standard. Avery really brings a whole bag of features and improvements and even small touches around the UX that brings a smile on my face. From the haptics to the “feel” of the app I really love it. For me personally I find it hard to use 3rd party apps because of the companies that treat them as second class citizens and the API have many limitations that nerf apps like this from working with a full feature set. I love supporting developers that take that leap of faith and sink god knows how many hours to make a product like this. Yes it has it faults but everything does. I give this app 5 stars because for what it is and by a small team of people and all these limitations this is a fantastic app with great experiences.</p>

    The Apollo variant of Twitter
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been using Aviary as my main Twitter app for some time now, and I grew to fall in love with it. The UI which reminds me of Apollo is part of the reason why I use it as my main Twitter app the other part is just how fluid and clean the app looks from the app icon to the app itself it shows how much the developer cared about the design of the app and to make it as if Apple created the app itself! While it’s not perfect I do have issue trying to use the app on my Apple Watch Series 3 where it won’t let me log in and they’re still some things I would love to see added in future builds assuming the Twitter API allows it, but at the end of the day I plan on keeping with Aviary for all my Twitter needs and can’t wait to see where it’ll be a year from now!</p>

I was excited for the potential and the features that were being added. Initially it was difficult to use. The feature was there but the app was still early days and still had some rough edges.\n\nFor the past month or so, however, Aviary has become my daily driver for Twitter on my phone. It runs more smoothly and the rough edges are being cleaned up with each update. On top of that the feature set is unparalleled among third party Twitter clients. There are still occasional crashes, but the developer is quick to correct.

Avery really brings a whole bag of features and improvements and even small touches around the UX that brings a smile on my face. From the haptics to the “feel” of the app I really love it. For me personally I find it hard to use 3rd party apps because of the companies that treat them as second class citizens and the API have many limitations that nerf apps like this from working with a full feature set. I love supporting developers that take that leap of faith and sink god knows how many hours to make a product like this. Yes it has it faults but everything does. I give this app 5 stars because for what it is and by a small team of people and all these limitations this is a fantastic app with great experiences.","title":"A Twitter Client With Taste","userName":"Jslee14"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6437698916","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-17T09:10:32Z","developerResponse":{"id":18055246,"body":"Hey there, thank you for the feedback! \n\nI appreciate you thinking that.","modified":"2020-09-23T15:21:46Z"},"rating":5,"review":"I’ve been using Aviary as my main Twitter app for some time now, and I grew to fall in love with it. The UI which reminds me of Apollo is part of the reason why I use it as my main Twitter app the other part is just how fluid and clean the app looks from the app icon to the app itself it shows how much the developer cared about the design of the app and to make it as if Apple created the app itself! While it’s not perfect I do have issue trying to use the app on my Apple Watch Series 3 where it won’t let me log in and they’re still some things I would love to see added in future builds assuming the Twitter API allows it, but at the end of the day I plan on keeping with Aviary for all my Twitter needs and can’t wait to see where it’ll be a year from now!","title":"The Apollo variant of Twitter","userName":"Zues2020"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6738641325","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-12-10T19:15:38Z","developerResponse":{"id":22765817,"body":"Hi there, thank you for your feedback.

Unfortunately there are too many bugs or things that just don’t work right.\n\nLinks often don’t match what they should, and sometimes you can watch the link change in the tweet to something unrelated right before your eyes. Very odd. You may tap a link and get something completely different.\n\nIf you share a tweet through iMessage, more often than not the tweet doesn’t actually share, it just sends a blank message.\n\nI can’t figure out how to view the tweet that is being retweeted. Sometimes I can tap on it and it takes me to that tweet, sometimes absolutely nothing happens. Same thing for tweets in the timeline. Sometimes tapping on a tweet takes me to a completely different tweet.\n\nAnd the thing that is most infuriating, when you open the app, it shows the tweets you were viewing last time, not the newest tweets. On the iPad, tapping the “Feed” tab takes you to the top, but this doesn’t work on the iPhone. You have to tap the top of the screen.\n\nGreat idea for an app, but it really doesn’t work as it should. Hopefully over time it will mature. But, this was released before it was ready, leaving us paying customers as beta testers.","title":"Good start but needs help","userName":"sdh9"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6541911760","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-16T17:43:31Z","developerResponse":{"id":18592325,"body":"Hey there, thank you for the feedback!\n\nI'm sorry you've been facing these issues.

He cares more about insignificant new features, but rarely fixing bugs. I’ve switched back to my old Twitter app, I can’t take daily updates with no bug fixes. \n\n• Timeline doesn’t remember where I was. I often read the same tweet multiple times because it scrolled back. This bug is SO common I’m shocked it shipped this way.\n• Duplicate chunks of tweets a few times: I scroll past a bunch, then the same bunch again. Only seen this once or twice.\n• Tweeting at an account I follow doesn’t show a suggestion for that account, rather other random accounts I don’t follow. I have to type the entire user name every single time.\n• Can’t long-press any links to copy the URL.\n• Tapping a linked tweet “preview” opens details for the tweet of the account I follow, not the tweet that person linked to.\n• Undoing a retweet is strangely rather difficult.\n\nPS: we don’t need or want four updates in a day. Focus more time on developing.

And of course, it never interrupts your timeline with \"You should follow these algorithmically-chosen people!\" and other such irritants pleading for you to stay after you've read everything new.\n\nThe bad is that it's not quite polished yet on the Mac. I wish I could resize the window such that I only have two columns—timeline and detail—without the search column (or whatever column of your choosing) permanently displayed. I wish the media player worked at all. I also wish the window titlebar wasn't there and the columns were full-height, like Mail or Messages.
