        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I use this app mainly for property lines and the mapping. Other apps are way more expensive a year for literally only one state worth of property lines. The 3D feature has to be the best thing about it, being able to look at a 3D map of the terrain in a hilly area really improves scouting. Only downfall is the map doesn’t show a lot of smaller creeks that are in the woods, but I can usually pull up google maps and it’ll show me if I’m really curious. I’ve never tried any of the weather stuff or go off of any of the “hunt predictions” so I can’t say anything about those. Truly if you want to know the weather check it on your phone and get out there in the woods regardless because it’s unpredictable. All in all tho it’s a very useful thing to have if you want to pay for the membership.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve had HuntWise on my iPhone for a few years.  It was a free app when I started using it.  It was also very easy to use and an almost perfect app for a hunter.  I had 7 stands marked and could open the app and check all the stands for wind, moon phase, temp etc. in about three minutes.  <br />But all good things come to an end.  HuntWise started to “improve” the app and wanted everyone to purchase the new one.  So they started to take away from the free one.  This month I gave up and upgraded to the Pro.  So far not impressed at all.  From the pics on the come-on’s to upgrade I thought I would be getting what used to be free.  Wrong!  So far it is amazingly difficult to use.  My original stands are on the map but not listed. So the only way to get to the stand is use my finger to move the map to the stand.  Once there all that is shown is the stand itself, no wind direction....nothing!  Then when I try to get a prediction the app immediately defaults to my home.  I’ll play with the app some more but I doubt that I’ll be a HuntWise costumer much longer.<br />If they would get back to what they had when it was free, simple to use and very informative, I would gladly pay.</p>

    Very useful app. Could use a couple of simple additions..

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Love the app, use it to mark down everything I see. <br /><br />A couple of things that I have experienced that I hope can be improved:<br /><br />When you have very bad reception and are recording your path, the recorded path will erase entirely when you go somewhere and have no reception. I understand not being able to continue the recorded path at that point, but it would be VERY helpful if it would auto save the path that was being recorded up to that point, and also if it would have an option to automatically resume the path whenever you get back into an area with reception. <br /><br />Second, I wish that it would show your current elevation when you are creating a marker or recording a path. No need to continuously track elevation, but i would love to be able to see what elevation the path began and ended at, with occasional updates every 500 feet up or down, or something like that. At the very least, having the best guess at current elevation when pinning a marker would be awesome.<br /><br />Other than those two things, it works awesome and I will continue to use it and pay the membership during the seasons I use it often.</p>

Other apps are way more expensive a year for literally only one state worth of property lines. The 3D feature has to be the best thing about it, being able to look at a 3D map of the terrain in a hilly area really improves scouting. Only downfall is the map doesn’t show a lot of smaller creeks that are in the woods, but I can usually pull up google maps and it’ll show me if I’m really curious. I’ve never tried any of the weather stuff or go off of any of the “hunt predictions” so I can’t say anything about those. Truly if you want to know the weather check it on your phone and get out there in the woods regardless because it’s unpredictable.

It was a free app when I started using it.  It was also very easy to use and an almost perfect app for a hunter.  I had 7 stands marked and could open the app and check all the stands for wind, moon phase, temp etc. in about three minutes.  \nBut all good things come to an end.  HuntWise started to “improve” the app and wanted everyone to purchase the new one.  So they started to take away from the free one.  This month I gave up and upgraded to the Pro.  So far not impressed at all.  From the pics on the come-on’s to upgrade I thought I would be getting what used to be free.  Wrong!  So far it is amazingly difficult to use.  My original stands are on the map but not listed. So the only way to get to the stand is use my finger to move the map to the stand.  Once there all that is shown is the stand itself, no wind direction....nothing!  Then when I try to get a prediction the app immediately defaults to my home.  I’ll play with the app some more but I doubt that I’ll be a HuntWise costumer much longer.\nIf they would get back to what they had when it was free, simple to use and very informative, I would gladly pay.","title":"So far not so good","userName":"Vey Unhappy"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7820285678","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-09-18T21:32:42Z","rating":5,"review":"Love the app, use it to mark down everything I see. \n\nA couple of things that I have experienced that I hope can be improved:\n\nWhen you have very bad reception and are recording your path, the recorded path will erase entirely when you go somewhere and have no reception. I understand not being able to continue the recorded path at that point, but it would be VERY helpful if it would auto save the path that was being recorded up to that point, and also if it would have an option to automatically resume the path whenever you get back into an area with reception. \n\nSecond, I wish that it would show your current elevation when you are creating a marker or recording a path. No need to continuously track elevation, but i would love to be able to see what elevation the path began and ended at, with occasional updates every 500 feet up or down, or something like that. At the very least, having the best guess at current elevation when pinning a marker would be awesome.\n\nOther than those two things, it works awesome and I will continue to use it and pay the membership during the seasons I use it often.","title":"Very useful app. Could use a couple of simple additions..","userName":"H.
