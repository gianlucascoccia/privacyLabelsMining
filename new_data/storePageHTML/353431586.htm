    Fantastic Expense Tracking App!

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been using this app for many years now, and after retirement noticed that the app would not update. I thought the developers had stopped supporting it, and just left it since I did not need it anymore due to retiring.<br />Turns out that may gran daughter needed to track her expenses, and I started looking for another app, then, to my great and welcome surprise, I found it buried in the long list of business expense tracking apps. How sad that this incredibly powerful, and intuitive app would be buried like this. I still do not understand why it would not update on either my iPhone or iPad, and yet after visiting the Apple App Store, it updated without any problem.<br />I have used this App since it started, and with my international business travel, I find it to be superb for time and expense tracking. Billing customers becomes a simple task when using this great App.<br />Keep up the good work!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This was an outstanding app and I have used it since it’s start in 2009 and I will continue to use the old app until it no longer works , however I will never pay a company for a subscription. I hate and despise companies who do this. and this company is another classic example. I will gladly pay an upgrade fee however never a subscription. So I say I’m not sorry that I am cutting ties with this company since it turned to a subscription model only company. Good bye and good luck. Because it’s the customers that will keep your company up and running with no customers you have no company. The app does have several ways to back up even through Wi-Fi desktop however let me warn you, Through the Wi-Fi back up to your desktop you are limited to the number of logs files or it will crash every time and will not do a sysnc backup, now iCloud will do unlimited logs and transactions syncs because I have synced over 7k files and images without any problems and quick, however Wi-Fi to desktop will definitely not work and I have been with this app since 2009. And will only use the old version until it actually don’t work anymore because eventually with iOS updates it’s bound to stop working in the future. Because I will not be forced into a subscription payment. I will look for another app that’s just as good</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I do not write many reviews. However, I have enjoyed this app for several years, and feel it is one of few apps which deserve a review. I have this on my iPhone, and have used it for my current and previous job. I have used this app mostly for monthly travel expenses and/or time tracking. The countless number of ways to customize this app is one of its strongest features. The amount of effort this developer has put into flexibility is amazing. Expense and time entry is quick, yet can be very detailed if desired. Data can be viewed and reported many different ways. Lists of clients/customers, projects, and more can be saved and reused. The few times I needed to request support from the developer were quickly and thoroughly responded to. Extremely happy with this app, and would recommend to anyone.</p>

How sad that this incredibly powerful, and intuitive app would be buried like this. I still do not understand why it would not update on either my iPhone or iPad, and yet after visiting the Apple App Store, it updated without any problem.\nI have used this App since it started, and with my international business travel, I find it to be superb for time and expense tracking.

I hate and despise companies who do this. and this company is another classic example. I will gladly pay an upgrade fee however never a subscription. So I say I’m not sorry that I am cutting ties with this company since it turned to a subscription model only company. Good bye and good luck. Because it’s the customers that will keep your company up and running with no customers you have no company. The app does have several ways to back up even through Wi-Fi desktop however let me warn you, Through the Wi-Fi back up to your desktop you are limited to the number of logs files or it will crash every time and will not do a sysnc backup, now iCloud will do unlimited logs and transactions syncs because I have synced over 7k files and images without any problems and quick, however Wi-Fi to desktop will definitely not work and I have been with this app since 2009. And will only use the old version until it actually don’t work anymore because eventually with iOS updates it’s bound to stop working in the future. Because I will not be forced into a subscription payment. I will look for another app that’s just as good","title":"It was an outstanding appp","userName":"Retired_Marine_30_4"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3464738691","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-11-27T03:24:57Z","rating":5,"review":"I do not write many reviews. However, I have enjoyed this app for several years, and feel it is one of few apps which deserve a review. I have this on my iPhone, and have used it for my current and previous job. I have used this app mostly for monthly travel expenses and/or time tracking. The countless number of ways to customize this app is one of its strongest features. The amount of effort this developer has put into flexibility is amazing. Expense and time entry is quick, yet can be very detailed if desired. Data can be viewed and reported many different ways. Lists of clients/customers, projects, and more can be saved and reused. The few times I needed to request support from the developer were quickly and thoroughly responded to. Extremely happy with this app, and would recommend to anyone.","title":"Have enjoyed this app for many years","userName":"Klausbird"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3050205877","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-08-11T15:00:39Z","rating":4,"review":"Update:\nLock up issue mostly gone.  The notes field is larger and it scrolls better.  Great fix of an item from a prior review.  Still as useful as ever.  Auto backup is seamless.  No worries if something happens to this I-pad.  I have been using for over 4-years now.  All my time, mileage and expenses are tracked for for both a salaried job and multiple clients for my LLC.\n\nUpdate:\nStill using, still very useful features.\nHowever, has become prone to locking up after several items are input. This is generally when putting in text details about a time entry.  Only way out is to force it to close, reopen and reenter the latest input.  I close and reopen it frequently if I have numerous additions to make.  Running a 4 year old i-pad Air.  Other apps are closed when this happens.  No longer 5-stars for me.\n\nOriginal:\nI have been using for 2 years. I track time, expenses, mileage and activities for multiple clients and jobs. Backs up to drop box every time it opens. The reporting has been useful for invoices, time sheet input and as an input for taxes.  \nThe search function upgrade to return to the last spot on the search list after looking closer at a particular item is great. \nMaking it better?  A larger text box for adding notes to an entry.  It scrolls, but it would be more useful for review if more was visible at once.\nOverall, it is great.","title":"Working better","userName":"Langchester"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3018052119","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-08-04T21:53:13Z","rating":5,"review":"First let me start with saying i never thought I could ever save receipts and keep track of logging expenses, in my mind I was terrible at doing this and thought I had to pay an assistant to help!

It’s simple so that makes it easy to use.  I really wish you could customize or add categories though.  You’ll find that it’s not exactly tuned for every business but gets 90% of what you need.
