    Best Mileage Tracking App I’ve Found!
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been using this app since 2012 (it’s now 2019) - it’s the best one I’ve found and would recommend to ANYone. The auto-tracking features that lets you “just drive” &amp; edit description later is a HUGE plus and a great help = saves a TON of time. I don’t think there’s any part of an entry that you can’t edit, including indicating “one-way”, or “round-trip“. You can even edit/modify the mileage if the auto tracking amount is incorrect, create expense categories, edit client, project, or group (business/personal), add notes, and set currency type. It even auto-calculates your mileage deduction per the current year IRS per-mile deductible rate by each drive you make AND by the monthly log total so you can see your deductions at a glance. You can also backup your info and export your logs as reports. This app is a MUST HAVE!</p>

    Best Mileage Tracker
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have tried several of these mileage apps and settled twice on MileTracker. I don&#39;t want automatic tracking while I drive (uses space and battery in my phone) - I travel to the same local places almost all the time. This is absolutely the only app that makes it easy to designate and name favorite locations and track round trip mileage to them easily and MileTracker always delights me when it designates my starting point as the place where I currently am. Also, for several years I have used this app to create yearend reports that have passed muster with my accountant. Don&#39;t look further than this app - simple and just what you need.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>It was a bad time for the app to ask me to rate it. I&#39;ll start with one star until I find that I am the problem, not the app. It is irritating that on occasion I open the program and I don&#39;t see data I&#39;ve previously entered. I can&#39;t find it. Other times, for reasons I don&#39;t understand, the data is present. There may be a simple answer to my problem, but I would simply prefer that the data appear when I open the app.<br /><br />Another annoying thing is preparing reports from data I&#39;ve entered. I own rental properties and , in one case, I must keep travel expenses separate for two condo units within a single development complex. I haven&#39;t found the reports flexible enough to handle this problem.<br /><br />As I&#39;ve said, perhaps I am the problem, not the app. But, unless I can find myself far more satisfied with the app than I am at the present time, I will delete the app and search for what I consider a better one that meets my needs with fewer problems.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi, I read your review today and I think all can be resolved with a simple phone call.  I can give you a quick tour of how the app works.  The unique feature is the concept of Logs.  Logs are simply folders which help you organize your entries.  As for the reports, the app is one of the most flexible and feature-rich.  I can help you with this via email or if you wish via a phone call.  Since we are not provided contact information for you it will be up to you to reach out and provide us with your contact information.  Just tap the &quot;Email the Author&quot; link within the Prefs screen within MileTracker.</p>

I don’t think there’s any part of an entry that you can’t edit, including indicating “one-way”, or “round-trip“. You can even edit/modify the mileage if the auto tracking amount is incorrect, create expense categories, edit client, project, or group (business/personal), add notes, and set currency type. It even auto-calculates your mileage deduction per the current year IRS per-mile deductible rate by each drive you make AND by the monthly log total so you can see your deductions at a glance.

I'll start with one star until I find that I am the problem, not the app. It is irritating that on occasion I open the program and I don't see data I've previously entered. I can't find it. Other times, for reasons I don't understand, the data is present. There may be a simple answer to my problem, but I would simply prefer that the data appear when I open the app.\n\nAnother annoying thing is preparing reports from data I've entered. I own rental properties and , in one case, I must keep travel expenses separate for two condo units within a single development complex. I haven't found the reports flexible enough to handle this problem.\n\nAs I've said, perhaps I am the problem, not the app. But, unless I can find myself far more satisfied with the app than I am at the present time, I will delete the app and search for what I consider a better one that meets my needs with fewer problems.","title":"Waiting To Learn More","userName":"mottle"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2113996602","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-01-22T06:08:03Z","rating":4,"review":"Started with this app a couple of years ago after having used a program tied into Garmin.
