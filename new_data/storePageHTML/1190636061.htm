        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>OK, the commercials are crap, but, again, they are on a par with the daytime TV stuff shown with OTA programming and I can deal with that. What makes the streaming video unwatchable is an extremely annoying and LOUD 10 second loop played when there aren’t enough commercials to fill the break time (at the time of this review 8-10 repititions). If I am absolutely determined to watch, I kill the sound until the program begins again. This means I’m not listening to any of the paid advertisements at all. Usually, though, I just exit the app and try to understand why I haven’t deleted it yet.<br /><br />update:  the @#$%! commercials and the annoying chanting have been eliminated, MUCH better. Still a few minor bugs, but all in all a distinct improvement.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The Ad’s are ridiculous! I understand that they are needed to keep your site free.. however, they are extremely excessive and very annoyingly interruptive!! Cannot enjoy our faves without an Ad interrupting every darn Two minutes or so! Also!, you definitely need to add more NEW episodes more OFTEN! I am a huge fan of many such as “Steve Wilkos”:ect, but it has been almost two months that you have added anything new..and that is on all talk shows!! 😡really quite disappointing especially when you finally find a free App with all your favorite daytime talk shows or reality TV shows.. Would have definitely been 5***** .. when this gets better, I’m sure you’ll immediately get thousands of 5*****’s and thousands of new viewers!! <br />DISAPPOINTED! 😒</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I understand that media needs sponsored advertising, but There are a few things wrong with this app besides the ads. There are a few things I like, which will also be mentioned. <br />1. If you scroll by mistake, the commercial on the next thumbnail forces you to watch that accident so you can’t scroll back to what you were originally watched.<br />2. Everything is in a scroll format! I liked exiting and entering each video on an individual basis where it can be seen without any accidental scrolling.<br />3. The advertisements repeat over an over. When you go BACK to show and try to begin where you left off, the advertisement comes on as soon as you find your place back in the video and starts over as if you didn’t even forward the video ahead<br />What I do like is the accessibility of Steve Wilkos who is my favorite person and watching him has always given me fresh perspective on society and the world we live in today. This is the only reason I have the Nosey app! <br />I also like that’s it’s much crisper in the video and the audio is nice too.<br />I just get turned off watching Nosey due to the other problems above.</p>

We use standard OAuth (open authorization) to enable you to give permission to share your information with other websites and services, such as Facebook (e.g., when you agree to a pop-up requesting you to allow another application to access your account information). We also use OAuth to allow us to share information about you that is stored by us without sharing your security credentials.\r\n\r\n•\tConsent. We share information with notice to you and your consent.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, we share information that does not identify you (including information that has been aggregated or de-identified) except as prohibited by applicable law. For example, we share and/or license aggregate geolocation data to our affiliates, agents, business and promotional partners, and other third parties. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe the Platform and these products and services to current and prospective business partners and investors and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.\r\n\r\n\nFor information on your rights and choices regarding how we share information about you, please see the “Your Rights and Choices” section below.\r\n\r\n\n\nOther Parties \n\n\r\n\r\nWe offer parts of our Platform through websites, platforms, and services operated or controlled by other parties. In addition, we integrate technologies operated or controlled by other parties into parts of our Service. \n\n\r\n\r\nSome examples include:\r\n\r\n•\tLinks. Our Platform includes links that hyperlink to websites, platforms, and other services not operated or controlled by us. \r\n\r\n•\tLogging-In. We may embed a pixel or SDK on our Platform that allows you to login to your account through social media. If you choose to engage with such integration, we may receive information from the social network that you have authorized to share with us. Please note that the social network may independently collect information about you through the integration. \r\n\r\n•\tBrand Pages and Chatbots. We may offer our content through social media. Any information you provide to us when you engage with our content (such as through our brand page or via our chatbot on Facebook Messenger) is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Also, if you publicly reference our Platform on social media (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Nosey in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our Service.\r\n\r\n\nPlease note that when you interact with other parties, including when you leave our Platform, those parties may independently collect information about you and solicit information from you. The information collected and stored by those parties remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.\n\n\r\n\n\nYour Rights and Choices\r\n\r\n\nIf you are a California resident or a data subject in Europe, please see the additional disclosures at the end of this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n\nAccessing and Modifying Information and Communication Preferences\r\n\r\n\nYou may access, remove, review, and/or make changes to your information by contacting us as set forth below. Please note that we will retain and use information about you as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. In addition, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the \"unsubscribe\" link located on the bottom of any Nosey marketing e-mail.  Please note that your opt out is limited to the email address and device used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions.  You cannot opt out of receiving transactional e-mails related to the Platform (e.g., requests for support). If you have opted-in to receive push notification on your device, you can opt-out at any time by adjusting the permissions in your device or uninstalling our mobile app.\r\n\r\nTracking Technology Choices.\r\n\r\n•\tCookies and Pixels. Most browsers accept cookies by default. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. \r\n\r\n•\tDo Not Track. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, Nosey does not monitor, recognize, or honor any opt-out or do not track mechanisms, including general web browser \"Do Not Track\" settings and/or signals. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com. For instructions on how to opt out of third-party interest-based advertising, please see \"Analytics and  Interest-Based Advertising\" below. \r\n\r\n•\tApp and Location Technologies. You can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app. You can also reset your device Ad Id at any time through your device settings, which is designed to allow you to limit the use of information collected about you. You can stop all collection of precise location data through an app by uninstalling the app or withdrawing your consent through your device settings.\r\n\r\n\nPlease be aware that if you disable or remove tracking technologies some parts of the Platform may not function correctly.\r\n\r\n\n\nAnalytics and Interest-Based Advertising\n\n\r\n\r\nGoogle provides tools to allow you to opt out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/ .  \r\n\r\nThe companies we work with to provide you with targeted ads are required by us to give you the choice to opt out of receiving targeted ads. Most of these companies are participants of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and/or the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). \n\nTo learn more about the targeted ads provided by these companies, and how to opt out of receiving certain targeted ads from them, please visit: (i) for website targeted ads from DAA participants, https://www.aboutads.info/choices; (ii) for app targeted ads from DAA participants, https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices; and (iii) for targeted ads from NAI participants, https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. \n\nOpting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participants’ other customers or from other technology services).\r\n\r\n\r\n\nAdditionally, users of mobile devices can follow the below instructions:\r\n\r\n\nAndroid Users\n\n\r\n\nFor Android devices with OS 2.2 and up and Google Play Services version 4.0 and up:\r\n\r\n\nOpen your Google Settings app \u003e Ads \u003e Enable \"Opt out of interest-based advertising.\"\r\n\r\n\n\niOS Users\r\n\r\niOS 7 or Higher\r\n\r\n\nGo to your Settings \u003e Select Privacy \u003e Select Advertising \u003e Enable the \"Limit Ad Tracking\" setting.\r\n\r\niOS 6\r\n\r\n\nGo to your Settings \u003eSelect General \u003e Select About \u003e Select Advertising \u003e Enable the \"Limit Ads Tracking\" setting.\r\n\r\n\nPlease note that if you opt out using any of these methods, the opt out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any opt out options or programs, or the accuracy of any other entities’ statements regarding their opt out options or programs.\n\n \r\nHow We Protect Your Information \r\n\r\n\nWe take commercially reasonable steps to protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases or the databases of the third parties with which we may share such information, nor can we guarantee that the Information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to us may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. \r\n\r\n\nImportant Notices to Non-U.S. Residents\r\n\r\n\nThe Platform and its servers are operated in the United States. Please be aware that your Information, including your personal information, may be transferred to, processed, maintained, and used on computers, servers, and systems located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. You must be located in the United States or Canada to use the Platform. If you are located outside the United States and choose to use the Platform, you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to such transfer, processing, and use in the United States and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nExternal Websites\r\n\r\n\nThe Platform may contain links to third-party websites. Nosey has no control over the privacy practices or the content of these websites. As such, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those third-party websites. You should check the applicable third-party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any other websites.\r\n\r\nChildren\r\n \r\nThe Platform is not directed to children under the age of 13 and intended for a general audience. Nosey adheres to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\") and does not knowingly collect personal information from any child under the age of 13. We ask that minors (under the age of 13) not submit any personal information to us. \r\n \r\nNeither we nor any third party acting on our behalf employs behavioral advertising or retargeting in connection with users whom we know to be under 13 years old.\r\n\r\n\nIf a child under the age of 13 has provided us with Personal Information, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us and request that such information be deleted from our records in accordance with COPPA.\r\n\r\n\nWe do not knowingly “sell,” as that term is defined under the CCPA, the personal information of minors under 16 years old who are California residents.\r\n\r\nChanges to This Privacy Policy\r\n \r\nThis Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated at the top of this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any such changes will be effective immediately and posted on the Platform. By accessing the Platform after we make any such changes to this Privacy Policy, you are deemed to have accepted such changes. Please be aware that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, our use of the information is governed by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collect the information.\r\n \r\nContact Us\r\n \r\nIf you have questions about this Privacy Policy, our data practices, or our compliance with applicable law,  please e-mail us at privacy@nosey.com with \"Privacy Policy\" in the subject line.\r\n \r\nAdditional Disclosures for Nevada Residents\r\n\r\n\nNevada law (NRS 603A.340) requires each business to establish a designated request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties. If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law, please contact us as at privacy@nosey.com.\r\n\r\n\nAdditional Disclosures for California Residents\r\n\r\n\nThese additional disclosures apply only to California residents. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides additional rights to know, delete, opt-out, and not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights. The CCPA requires businesses collecting or disclosing personal information to provide notices and means to exercise your rights.  \r\n\r\n\n\n1.\tNotice of Collection\r\n\r\nIn the past 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information listed in the CCPA: \r\n\r\n•\tIdentifiers, including name, email address, and online identifiers (such as IP address).  \r\n\r\n•\tCharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law, including gender.  \r\n\r\n•\tCommercial information, including records of titles viewed.\r\n\r\n•\tInternet activity, including interactions with our website, emails, applications, or advertisements. \r\n\r\n•\tGeolocation data.\r\n\r\n•\tInferences drawn from the above information about your predicted characteristics and preferences. \r\n\r\n\nFor further details on information we collect, including the sources from which we receive information, review the The Information We Collect section above. We collect and use these categories of personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How Information is Used section, including to manage our Platform. \r\n\r\n\nTo the extent “sale” under the CCPA is interpreted to include the activities set out in this Privacy Policy, such as those disclosed in the Third-Party Analytics and Third-Party Advertising section, we will comply with applicable law as to such activity. We disclose the following categories of personal information for commercial purposes: identifiers, characteristics, commercial information, internet activity, geolocation data, and inferences drawn. Please review the Sharing Information section for further details about the categories of parties with whom we share information. \r\n\r\n\n\n2.\tRight to Know and Delete\r\n\r\n\nYou have the right to know certain details about our data practices in the past 12 months or delete the personal information we have collected from you. You may request the following information from us:\r\n\r\n•\tThe categories of personal information we have collected about you;  \r\n•\tThe categories of sources from which the personal information was collected; \r\n•\tThe categories of personal information about you we disclosed for a business purpose or sold; \r\n•\tThe categories of third parties to whom the personal information was disclosed for a business purpose or sold; \r\n•\tThe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the personal information; and \r\n•\tThe specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.\r\n\r\n\nTo exercise any of these rights, please submit a request through our Online Form or email us at privacy@nosey.com. In the request, please specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the request. We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days. We may require specific information from you to help us verify your identity and process your request. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your requests to know or delete, in whole or in part.\r\n\r\n\nPlease note you can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. However, we will require written proof of the agent’s permission to do so and verify your identity directly. \r\n\r\n\n\n3.\tRight to Opt-Out \r\n\r\n\nTo the extent Nosey sells your personal information as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information by us to third parties at any time. You may request to opt-out by clicking Do Not Sell My Personal Information on our home page and making your choice. \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n4.\tShine the Light\r\n\r\n\nUnder California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents who have an established business relationship with Nosey may choose to opt out of our sharing your personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and (1) you wish to opt out; or (2) you wish to request certain information regarding our disclosure of your personal information to third parties for the direct marketing purposes, please send an e-mail to privacy@nosey.com with \"Privacy Policy\" in the subject line or write to us at:\n\r\n\r\n\nNosey Baxter, LLC\r\n675 Third Avenue\r\n11th Floor\r\nNew York, New York 10017\r\nAttention: Privacy Policy\r\n\r\nAdditional Disclosures for Data Subjects in Europe\r\n\r\n\n1.\tRoles\n\n\r\n\r\nData protection laws in Europe distinguish between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”). Nosey Baxter, LLC acts as a controller with respect to personal data collected as you interact with our websites, emails, and advertisements. \r\n\r\n\n2.\tLawful Basis for Processing\n\n\n\r\nData protection laws in Europe require a “lawful basis” for processing personal data. Our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us or to our service providers, partners; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (d) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests. Where applicable, we will transfer your personal data to third countries subject to appropriate or suitable safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses.\r\n\r\n\n3.\tYour Data Subject Rights\r\n\r\n\nYou have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.\n\n\r\n\nTo exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@nosey.com and specify which right you are seeking to exercise. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may require specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. \r\n\r\n\nPlease note that we retain information as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.\n\r\n\r\n\nIf you have any issues with our compliance, you may contact us at 675 Third Avenue, Fl 11, New York, NY 10017. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction.\n\n\r\n\r\n","is32bitOnly":false,"isStandaloneWithCompanionForWatchOS":false,"seller":"Nosey Baxter, LLC","isSiriSupported":false,"languageList":["English","Spanish"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"description":{"standard":"Nosey is the FREE TV video app with full episodes of the best of Maury Povich, Jerry Springer, Steve Wilkos, Paternity Court, Cheaters, Match Game, Family Feud and much, much more!\n\nReality, Court and Talk TV shows have never been easier to watch online.

We share information with vendors and other parties for analytics, advertising and permissions related purposes. These parties may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information. We share information about you with such partners for ad distribution and ad optimization (sometimes defined as the tailoring, targeting (i.e., behavioral, contextual, and retargeting), analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing of ads). These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs), and/or other technologies to collect other information for such purposes. Pixel tags enable us and these third-party advertising companies to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits the site on which the pixel tag is located in order to learn which advertisement brings a user to a given site. In addition, we may receive other information from advertisers and/or their service providers such as advertising identifiers, IP addresses, and post-conversion data. \r\n\r\n•\tPromotions. In order to provide our Platform and administer our contests, sweepstakes, rewards, and other promotional programs, we share your information with our third-party promotional and marketing partners, including, without limitation, businesses participating in our various programs.\r\n\r\n•\tAffiliates. We share your information with our parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us.\r\n\r\n•\tMerger or Acquisition. As we develop our businesses, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event, or during negotiations, of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, sale of assets, dissolution, or similar event, the Information may be part of the transferred assets.\r\n\r\n•\tSecurity and Compelled Disclosure. To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose your information: (i) when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency; or (ii) whenever we believe that disclosing such Information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of Nosey or others.\r\n\r\n•\tFacilitating Requests. We share information at your request or direction. For example, with your permission, third-party applications or services may access your information. We use standard OAuth (open authorization) to enable you to give permission to share your information with other websites and services, such as Facebook (e.g., when you agree to a pop-up requesting you to allow another application to access your account information). We also use OAuth to allow us to share information about you that is stored by us without sharing your security credentials.\r\n\r\n•\tConsent. We share information with notice to you and your consent.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, we share information that does not identify you (including information that has been aggregated or de-identified) except as prohibited by applicable law. For example, we share and/or license aggregate geolocation data to our affiliates, agents, business and promotional partners, and other third parties. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe the Platform and these products and services to current and prospective business partners and investors and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.\r\n\r\n\nFor information on your rights and choices regarding how we share information about you, please see the “Your Rights and Choices” section below.\r\n\r\n\n\nOther Parties \n\n\r\n\r\nWe offer parts of our Platform through websites, platforms, and services operated or controlled by other parties.

Any information you provide to us when you engage with our content (such as through our brand page or via our chatbot on Facebook Messenger) is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Also, if you publicly reference our Platform on social media (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Nosey in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our Service.\r\n\r\n\nPlease note that when you interact with other parties, including when you leave our Platform, those parties may independently collect information about you and solicit information from you. The information collected and stored by those parties remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.\n\n\r\n\n\nYour Rights and Choices\r\n\r\n\nIf you are a California resident or a data subject in Europe, please see the additional disclosures at the end of this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n\nAccessing and Modifying Information and Communication Preferences\r\n\r\n\nYou may access, remove, review, and/or make changes to your information by contacting us as set forth below.

Most browsers accept cookies by default. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. \r\n\r\n•\tDo Not Track. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, Nosey does not monitor, recognize, or honor any opt-out or do not track mechanisms, including general web browser \"Do Not Track\" settings and/or signals. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

You can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app. You can also reset your device Ad Id at any time through your device settings, which is designed to allow you to limit the use of information collected about you. You can stop all collection of precise location data through an app by uninstalling the app or withdrawing your consent through your device settings.\r\n\r\n\nPlease be aware that if you disable or remove tracking technologies some parts of the Platform may not function correctly.\r\n\r\n\n\nAnalytics and Interest-Based Advertising\n\n\r\n\r\nGoogle provides tools to allow you to opt out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/ .  \r\n\r\nThe companies we work with to provide you with targeted ads are required by us to give you the choice to opt out of receiving targeted ads. Most of these companies are participants of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and/or the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). \n\nTo learn more about the targeted ads provided by these companies, and how to opt out of receiving certain targeted ads from them, please visit: (i) for website targeted ads from DAA participants, https://www.aboutads.info/choices; (ii) for app targeted ads from DAA participants, https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices; and (iii) for targeted ads from NAI participants, https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. \n\nOpting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participants’ other customers or from other technology services).\r\n\r\n\r\n\nAdditionally, users of mobile devices can follow the below instructions:\r\n\r\n\nAndroid Users\n\n\r\n\nFor Android devices with OS 2.2 and up and Google Play Services version 4.0 and up:\r\n\r\n\nOpen your Google Settings app \u003e Ads \u003e Enable \"Opt out of interest-based advertising.\"\r\n\r\n\n\niOS Users\r\n\r\niOS 7 or Higher\r\n\r\n\nGo to your Settings \u003e Select Privacy \u003e Select Advertising \u003e Enable the \"Limit Ad Tracking\" setting.\r\n\r\niOS 6\r\n\r\n\nGo to your Settings \u003eSelect General \u003e Select About \u003e Select Advertising \u003e Enable the \"Limit Ads Tracking\" setting.\r\n\r\n\nPlease note that if you opt out using any of these methods, the opt out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any opt out options or programs, or the accuracy of any other entities’ statements regarding their opt out options or programs.\n\n \r\nHow We Protect Your Information \r\n\r\n\nWe take commercially reasonable steps to protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases or the databases of the third parties with which we may share such information, nor can we guarantee that the Information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to us may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. \r\n\r\n\nImportant Notices to Non-U.S. Residents\r\n\r\n\nThe Platform and its servers are operated in the United States. Please be aware that your Information, including your personal information, may be transferred to, processed, maintained, and used on computers, servers, and systems located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. You must be located in the United States or Canada to use the Platform. If you are located outside the United States and choose to use the Platform, you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to such transfer, processing, and use in the United States and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nExternal Websites\r\n\r\n\nThe Platform may contain links to third-party websites. Nosey has no control over the privacy practices or the content of these websites. As such, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those third-party websites. You should check the applicable third-party privacy policy and terms of use when visiting any other websites.\r\n\r\nChildren\r\n \r\nThe Platform is not directed to children under the age of 13 and intended for a general audience. Nosey adheres to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\") and does not knowingly collect personal information from any child under the age of 13. We ask that minors (under the age of 13) not submit any personal information to us. \r\n \r\nNeither we nor any third party acting on our behalf employs behavioral advertising or retargeting in connection with users whom we know to be under 13 years old.\r\n\r\n\nIf a child under the age of 13 has provided us with Personal Information, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us and request that such information be deleted from our records in accordance with COPPA.\r\n\r\n\nWe do not knowingly “sell,” as that term is defined under the CCPA, the personal information of minors under 16 years old who are California residents.\r\n\r\nChanges to This Privacy Policy\r\n \r\nThis Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated at the top of this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any such changes will be effective immediately and posted on the Platform. By accessing the Platform after we make any such changes to this Privacy Policy, you are deemed to have accepted such changes. Please be aware that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, our use of the information is governed by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collect the information.\r\n \r\nContact Us\r\n \r\nIf you have questions about this Privacy Policy, our data practices, or our compliance with applicable law,  please e-mail us at privacy@nosey.com with \"Privacy Policy\" in the subject line.\r\n \r\nAdditional Disclosures for Nevada Residents\r\n\r\n\nNevada law (NRS 603A.340) requires each business to establish a designated request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties. If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law, please contact us as at privacy@nosey.com.\r\n\r\n\nAdditional Disclosures for California Residents\r\n\r\n\nThese additional disclosures apply only to California residents. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides additional rights to know, delete, opt-out, and not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights. The CCPA requires businesses collecting or disclosing personal information to provide notices and means to exercise your rights.  \r\n\r\n\n\n1.\tNotice of Collection\r\n\r\nIn the past 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information listed in the CCPA: \r\n\r\n•\tIdentifiers, including name, email address, and online identifiers (such as IP address).  \r\n\r\n•\tCharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law, including gender.  \r\n\r\n•\tCommercial information, including records of titles viewed.\r\n\r\n•\tInternet activity, including interactions with our website, emails, applications, or advertisements. \r\n\r\n•\tGeolocation data.\r\n\r\n•\tInferences drawn from the above information about your predicted characteristics and preferences. \r\n\r\n\nFor further details on information we collect, including the sources from which we receive information, review the The Information We Collect section above. We collect and use these categories of personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How Information is Used section, including to manage our Platform. \r\n\r\n\nTo the extent “sale” under the CCPA is interpreted to include the activities set out in this Privacy Policy, such as those disclosed in the Third-Party Analytics and Third-Party Advertising section, we will comply with applicable law as to such activity. We disclose the following categories of personal information for commercial purposes: identifiers, characteristics, commercial information, internet activity, geolocation data, and inferences drawn. Please review the Sharing Information section for further details about the categories of parties with whom we share information. \r\n\r\n\n\n2.\tRight to Know and Delete\r\n\r\n\nYou have the right to know certain details about our data practices in the past 12 months or delete the personal information we have collected from you. You may request the following information from us:\r\n\r\n•\tThe categories of personal information we have collected about you;  \r\n•\tThe categories of sources from which the personal information was collected; \r\n•\tThe categories of personal information about you we disclosed for a business purpose or sold; \r\n•\tThe categories of third parties to whom the personal information was disclosed for a business purpose or sold; \r\n•\tThe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the personal information; and \r\n•\tThe specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.\r\n\r\n\nTo exercise any of these rights, please submit a request through our Online Form or email us at privacy@nosey.com. In the request, please specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the request. We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days. We may require specific information from you to help us verify your identity and process your request. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your requests to know or delete, in whole or in part.\r\n\r\n\nPlease note you can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. However, we will require written proof of the agent’s permission to do so and verify your identity directly. \r\n\r\n\n\n3.\tRight to Opt-Out \r\n\r\n\nTo the extent Nosey sells your personal information as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information by us to third parties at any time. You may request to opt-out by clicking Do Not Sell My Personal Information on our home page and making your choice. \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n4.\tShine the Light\r\n\r\n\nUnder California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents who have an established business relationship with Nosey may choose to opt out of our sharing your personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and (1) you wish to opt out; or (2) you wish to request certain information regarding our disclosure of your personal information to third parties for the direct marketing purposes, please send an e-mail to privacy@nosey.com with \"Privacy Policy\" in the subject line or write to us at:\n\r\n\r\n\nNosey Baxter, LLC\r\n675 Third Avenue\r\n11th Floor\r\nNew York, New York 10017\r\nAttention: Privacy Policy\r\n\r\nAdditional Disclosures for Data Subjects in Europe\r\n\r\n\n1.\tRoles\n\n\r\n\r\nData protection laws in Europe distinguish between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”). Nosey Baxter, LLC acts as a controller with respect to personal data collected as you interact with our websites, emails, and advertisements. \r\n\r\n\n2.\tLawful Basis for Processing\n\n\n\r\nData protection laws in Europe require a “lawful basis” for processing personal data. Our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us or to our service providers, partners; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (d) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests. Where applicable, we will transfer your personal data to third countries subject to appropriate or suitable safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses.\r\n\r\n\n3.\tYour Data Subject Rights\r\n\r\n\nYou have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.\n\n\r\n\nTo exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@nosey.com and specify which right you are seeking to exercise. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may require specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. \r\n\r\n\nPlease note that we retain information as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.\n\r\n\r\n\nIf you have any issues with our compliance, you may contact us at 675 Third Avenue, Fl 11, New York, NY 10017.

How are you supposed to know it’s new and how can you tell what show it is? Also you can hardly move the items to see what else is there. Plus, I created an account but when I requested a new password I received an error message.\n\nYou should revert back to the old version, it works much better.\n\n*********************************************\n\nThe update looks nice, but you have to constantly find your place if you get out of the app and you can’t tell when new items have been added.","title":"New stuff?","userName":"Kbop05"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7600068395","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-07-21T03:23:41Z","developerResponse":{"id":24338960,"body":"Hi Dave,\nThanks for taking the time to let us know.

After every commercial break, the episode would go back to the beginning and I would have to fast forward to where it had left off. I was watching a 2 part episode and there was a large portion of the show missing from the first episode. When I started the second part they were showing things that had happened in the previous episode that were not shown. I tried to go back to the first episode to see if the app had messed up and cut part of it off, but every time I tried going to the last 10 minutes, it would make me watch 5 more commercials.

The ads are absolutely ridiculous and almost make your shows unwatchable! They’re EXTREMELY LOUD and way too frequent!!!! I watch more ads than the actual show itself!!! There shouldn’t be 5-7 ads every 2 minutes of watching a show. I started my show, 5 ads, 30 seconds into my show 5 more ads interrupted. Like seriously??? Please reduce the ads this is getting ridiculous. So frustrating and annoying trying to enjoy your show with 5 ads popping up all the time. You guys need to do updates with new episodes as well!!!!
