        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>What is space, really? Too much space and we float off, lost in the expanse. Too little and we feel closed in. We retreat. There’s always the push and the pull. We flee the cramped confines of our city apartments to breathe some fresh country air, only to miss the coziness of a crowded room. We need compromise. A layer of control to balance out and land somewhere in between. Maybe a bigger yard. Or a weekend away. Maybe we just need to rearrange the furniture and clear the clutter. In poetry, space gives us pause –– permission to take a breath. Because what’s left unsaid is just as important as what’s written. And with this release, that’s what we’re introducing –– the ability to add space and specificity around your blocks. We’re calling it Block Padding, which is a term we borrowed from CSS. There’s something nice about using the same language for the GRID as CSS. We’re working to achieve the same thing –– precise alignment for form and flow and rhythm to your site. Now when you add a block, you can adjust the spacing around it. Use Padding to fine-tune layouts. Draw the eye in. Let your mind pour out onto the page. We can’t wait to see what you create.<br /><br />What&#39;s New:<br />Introducing Block Padding. Block Padding allows you to compose and add spacing around buttons, text blocks, and image blocks.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I just love this.. first of all, for myself anyway I found it very simple to use and create... I already have a website, but I loveeee clickable linked pix and graphics! So I basically just created what I consider to be a Virtual Business Card, each image is a link to my everything! A) my regular domain, my Phone, Email.. Photo Links to my socials, FB, IG, Twitter (2 Of each! 🤦🏻‍♀️, so it should make sense why this is so awesome for me.. links to my Snapchat too! I’m really impressed with it.. I do Social media marketing and some of the clients can’t afford a new website and maintain it and all of that.. so I’ve recommended this to quite a few.. a friend of mine is a realtor and I had her do this.. she’s not the savviest with this kind of thing but she still made one, I made a list of things for her to change but even what she put together is good enough and is everything if she wants to be successful.. I also really like that it’s more than just a stand-alone site.. it’s also a community.. which is additional exposure.. and starting off.. you can use all you can get! 5 Stars For Sure.. Totally Recommend This!</p>

    Ryder Cash media ”The Ryder Cash story”

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is the best app to build your website, company, brand, or whatever you want it to be. Especially if you don&#39;t know anything about developing a website. This is not only the easiest and fastest way to build a website, it&#39;s the best overall app!  I was super duper skeptical at first. It sounded to good to be true. I&#39;m glad I was wrong! This app is the truth; ”the people app.” I never expected to also learn as much as I have about computer tech and codes. It&#39;s helped me build a couple Facebook business apps and discover a whole new world I never thought was possible. I started my website to address a social injustice involving my 5 month old African American son. Soon I realized I wanted to start a multi media company. To help give others a voice that could be heard.  I started Ryder Cash Media named after my son. There&#39;s is not enough time for me to tell you everything I love about this app.  Shoot for the moon!  If you miss,  you still amongst those stars.. this is “The Ryder Cash story”.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been looking for site builders and honestly I’m very impressed. <br /><br />I love that you can have email subscribers (pro, but Im excited nonetheless)<br />And i love the way you can customize every page to your liking and even add subpages to swipe through. <br />I do wish there were a bit more shapes to play with and other photo effects to apply such as vignette, or top to bottom gradients that you can change the color of, etc.<br />I’m also curious if there’s ways to make more dynamic graphics. Maybe with a main page and its subpages: you can anchor the background to all, and just have the other graphics basically slide over the background. <br />And maybe other swipe effects/translations. <br />I think for how simple it is, a lot of bases are touched, and basic major components are included. <br /><br />And maybe some of these features are included in pro. I have no idea lol. Just throwing some ideas out there for an already great program. <br /><br />The more I mess around with it the more I’m leaning towards buying the lifetime pro account. It’s a very promising app. I just wish there was a trial so I can test all the pro features before deciding to spend money on it, however, I’m not too worried as I’m confident this would work perfect for what I need.</p>

You’d feel assured, calm, potentially terrified. But at least it’s not an anthropomorphized paper clip with undulating eyebrows.

Or, to stretch the metaphor out into the infinite-- imagine a piece of dust catching a narrow sliver of light. As you reach out your hand to try and grab it, the spec slinks away. Some weightless, directionless force is pulling it away from you. You are the eye that catches the dust in the light. And we are the static cling that pulls it out of sight.\n\nWhat we fixed:\n- Hotfix for errors when publishing sites.\n- Visual bug which resulted in extra vertical spacing within grid editor controls on any iPhone with a home button (i.e. SE, 8, or earlier).","releaseDate":"2021-08-04"},{"versionDisplay":"3.46.0","releaseNotes":"We’ve always thought that building a site on Universe feels like playing with Legos. This week we’re updating our Grid UI to make it easier to immerse yourself in that child-like sense of wonderment. First, we’re introducing a new, easy way to add blocks to your site. Simply tap the “add” button in the bottom left of the Grid and the familiar block picker will appear. When you pick a block it will find a spot on the grid, ready for your fingers to build. Next, Grid Controls are now easier to access with a settings button in the bottom left. From there, you can add rows to your site, change its background or theme, and adjust the grid’s density. Speaking of which, we’re adding something many of you have asked for: you can now go up to 7 columns wide for your site’s density. This will give you more room for blocks and for intricate designs. And you know that magical moment where you can grip and pull down another row of blocks onto the grid at the top of the editor? You can now pull up to add a row at the bottom of the grid as well. Enjoy!\n \nWhat’s New:\n• An easy way to add blocks to your site. Tap the new add button in the bottom  \n  left of the grid. You'll see the familiar block picker. When you pick a block it will find   \n  a spot on the grid at a typical size.\n• Grid controls are now easier to access with a settings button in the bottom left.\n• Pull to Add Row now works on the bottom of the grid too.\n• You can now adjust your site’s density to 7 columns wide.\nImproved:\n• The visual treatment of editor chrome like the close button or help button now blend \n   better with your site content so you can focus on editing.","releaseDate":"2021-08-02"},{"versionDisplay":"3.45.1","releaseNotes":"This week is Polish Week. It’s a week we love. A week we look forward to. A week we talk about in our Monday kickoffs. People get excited. I get excited. Still, I wanted to do some digging into what makes Polish Week special. Which brought me to the very engineer who asks me to write these release notes. (side note: no one asks for these release notes). Victor, who leads our iOS team, said “We use the app on a daily basis and run into the same issues some of our users encounter. Like us, they want the product to be better, and Polish Weeks are the perfect chance to focus on their requests. Some engineers will focus on fixing annoying bugs, while others will consider a highly requested feature. Because of that, Polish Weeks are magical - we never know what our engineers will be working on. By focusing on what’s important for our users, the results of these weeks are highly valuable and directly impactful.”  So that’s Polish Week. It’s a chance for your opinions and frustrations to come through and be buffed out. All in the name of continual improvement. And now we get to bask in the resplendent sheen of a freshly sluiced app. Until next time!\n\n• Block name changes and order updates\n• Link in Bio templates have new copy\n• Accessibility improvements\n• Dark mode improvements\n• Animated button consistency","releaseDate":"2021-07-22"},{"versionDisplay":"3.45.0","releaseNotes":"The first thing you notice is Spanish moss dripping from all the trees.

It’s unopened. Taped and dented and I tear into it. I’ve done this before. There’s a memory foam pillow stuffed inside. I keep bringing them to hotels and leaving them behind. I am forgetful in the morning and these things blend in with the sheets. This week’s update is all about helping you keep track of your Universe-based personal belongings. To that end, we fixed a visual bug on the orders page so you can see the date an order was placed. Also, link blocks now have improved memory, so if you enter a URL in one link block, and then switch to another, your information will be preserved when you toggle back. No need to start over. Nothing to leave behind. \n\n3.44.1 Specs:\nVisual bug fix for dates in orders list\nPreserve link when switching between link blocks\nBug fix for “show sites list” button on iPad","releaseDate":"2021-06-24"},{"versionDisplay":"3.44.0","releaseNotes":"There was once a gentleman I worked with who was a traveling salesman of sorts. He would come back from weeks on the road and regale us with stories of customer dinners and events from far away lands. Then he would stroll over to the accounting department and dump heaps of crumpled receipts from his trouser pockets onto their desks. Alas, he did not last very long at the firm. Because while it is important to keep a paper trail, it is also important to be civilized about doing so. This week we’re releasing a very civilized way for our merchants to handle any payment disputes, should they arise (which is why I am writing to you today in my most civilized British accent). Rather than correspond with our tip-top support team (who are all lovely, by the way), we’ve released a new flow by which any disputes are now displayed in-line with all your orders, so you can act on them right in the app. Indeed, swift action can be taken. Simply upload supporting documents — a picture of a crumpled up receipt might even do. Better yet, upload the shipping label, tracking number, or customer email thread, and voilà, the credit card company will have what they need for review. Then you will see any updates to the dispute in the app as they come in. Cheers!\n\n3.44.0 Specs\n- Disputes now show in the Order Manager.\n  - You can submit evidence to defend your case with the banks.\n  - You can check on the status of all your disputes to see if you won or lost.\n- Hiding Instagram gallery block upload option.","releaseDate":"2021-06-21"},{"versionDisplay":"3.43.8","releaseNotes":"I was walking down Venice Beach Boardwalk over the weekend and there was a crowd of people around a booth that said “Bitcoin Advice $5”. I assume the advice was quite simply “buy Bitcoin,” but I don’t know. Didn’t have any cash on hand. I missed out. The boardwalk is always flush with people selling products in inventive ways - guitar lessons, jewelry, tarot card readings- and now investment advice. It’s a real world metaphor for Universe sites. In that spirit, you now have the ability to connect your audience to your products and services seamlessly through your link in bio. You can accept donations, ask people to buy you a cup of coffee to fuel your work, sell jewelry, or offer investment advice. Completely customizable and totally up to you. We also added some payment block suggestions to our Link in Bio templates so you can have fresh ideas on how to use Universe as a tool for making money. And if you decide to sell bitcoin advice for $5, let us know! We wouldn’t want to miss out this time.

We’re more centered now. And you’ll feel more centered now too because we’ve centered the text in our new sign-in flow. Next, we let out the drawstrings on our shared sites code expiration length. It’s now a much roomier 30 days instead of 24 hours. It’s pretty chill. We fixed a bug where the mac app would hang indefinitely after tapping “publish” site. This was too chill, so we fixed that and now there’s no lag. Most importantly, Universe is for Everyone. That’s a truth that rings through every member of our team and we hope it comes through in our product. To that end, we’ve added accessibility features to our forms so they’re easier to navigate using VoiceOver. Lots of other bits and bobs as well. Till next time.

When you create a site for the first time, a floating animation will show you how to resize, move, and edit blocks on your page. You can move it around the screen. You can tap it to view more information. You can ignore it. You can say “I don’t need the instruction manual Clippy thing you’ve built”  That’s cool too. We’re easy. We’re just here to be your guide. \n\nWhat’s new:\n\nThere is a new guided, yet ignorable experience for onboarding in the editor. A floating animation will show you how to resize, move, and edit blocks. This floating animation can be moved around anywhere on screen or tapped to see more information.","releaseDate":"2021-08-16"},{"versionDisplay":"3.46.1","releaseNotes":"We’re not releasing any new features this time, but we did a hotfix for a bug that a verrrry small number of users caught sight of in the app. We could have ignored it. Definitely didn’t need to write about it. It was a very small bug. More like a flea, really. Or, to stretch the metaphor out into the infinite-- imagine a piece of dust catching a narrow sliver of light. As you reach out your hand to try and grab it, the spec slinks away. Some weightless, directionless force is pulling it away from you. You are the eye that catches the dust in the light. And we are the static cling that pulls it out of sight.\n\nWhat we fixed:\n- Hotfix for errors when publishing sites.\n- Visual bug which resulted in extra vertical spacing within grid editor controls on any iPhone with a home button (i.e. SE, 8, or earlier).","releaseDate":"2021-08-04"},{"versionDisplay":"3.46.0","releaseNotes":"We’ve always thought that building a site on Universe feels like playing with Legos. This week we’re updating our Grid UI to make it easier to immerse yourself in that child-like sense of wonderment. First, we’re introducing a new, easy way to add blocks to your site. Simply tap the “add” button in the bottom left of the Grid and the familiar block picker will appear. When you pick a block it will find a spot on the grid, ready for your fingers to build. Next, Grid Controls are now easier to access with a settings button in the bottom left. From there, you can add rows to your site, change its background or theme, and adjust the grid’s density. Speaking of which, we’re adding something many of you have asked for: you can now go up to 7 columns wide for your site’s density. This will give you more room for blocks and for intricate designs. And you know that magical moment where you can grip and pull down another row of blocks onto the grid at the top of the editor? You can now pull up to add a row at the bottom of the grid as well. Enjoy!\n \nWhat’s New:\n• An easy way to add blocks to your site. Tap the new add button in the bottom  \n  left of the grid. You'll see the familiar block picker. When you pick a block it will find   \n  a spot on the grid at a typical size.\n• Grid controls are now easier to access with a settings button in the bottom left.\n• Pull to Add Row now works on the bottom of the grid too.\n• You can now adjust your site’s density to 7 columns wide.\nImproved:\n• The visual treatment of editor chrome like the close button or help button now blend \n   better with your site content so you can focus on editing.","releaseDate":"2021-08-02"},{"versionDisplay":"3.45.1","releaseNotes":"This week is Polish Week. It’s a week we love. A week we look forward to. A week we talk about in our Monday kickoffs. People get excited. I get excited. Still, I wanted to do some digging into what makes Polish Week special. Which brought me to the very engineer who asks me to write these release notes. (side note: no one asks for these release notes). Victor, who leads our iOS team, said “We use the app on a daily basis and run into the same issues some of our users encounter. Like us, they want the product to be better, and Polish Weeks are the perfect chance to focus on their requests. Some engineers will focus on fixing annoying bugs, while others will consider a highly requested feature. Because of that, Polish Weeks are magical - we never know what our engineers will be working on. By focusing on what’s important for our users, the results of these weeks are highly valuable and directly impactful.”  So that’s Polish Week. It’s a chance for your opinions and frustrations to come through and be buffed out. All in the name of continual improvement. And now we get to bask in the resplendent sheen of a freshly sluiced app. Until next time!\n\n• Block name changes and order updates\n• Link in Bio templates have new copy\n• Accessibility improvements\n• Dark mode improvements\n• Animated button consistency","releaseDate":"2021-07-22"},{"versionDisplay":"3.45.0","releaseNotes":"The first thing you notice is Spanish moss dripping from all the trees. The dripping moss and the heat in your chest when you breathe. A tropical storm has landed in Savannah and so have I. We’ve dropped in. I am listening to Casimir Pulaski Day by Sufjan Stevens, not because it’s the Savannah vibe, but because he’s buried here and I walked past him in the cemetery and the song dropped into my head. Do songs drop into heads? Ghosts drop in. Or move through you. Recalcitrant. Alive. This week’s update has to do with drops. For all our hypebeasts out there, you can now design your site experience around dropping a single product.

He would come back from weeks on the road and regale us with stories of customer dinners and events from far away lands. Then he would stroll over to the accounting department and dump heaps of crumpled receipts from his trouser pockets onto their desks. Alas, he did not last very long at the firm. Because while it is important to keep a paper trail, it is also important to be civilized about doing so. This week we’re releasing a very civilized way for our merchants to handle any payment disputes, should they arise (which is why I am writing to you today in my most civilized British accent). Rather than correspond with our tip-top support team (who are all lovely, by the way), we’ve released a new flow by which any disputes are now displayed in-line with all your orders, so you can act on them right in the app. Indeed, swift action can be taken. Simply upload supporting documents — a picture of a crumpled up receipt might even do. Better yet, upload the shipping label, tracking number, or customer email thread, and voilà, the credit card company will have what they need for review. Then you will see any updates to the dispute in the app as they come in. Cheers!\n\n3.44.0 Specs\n- Disputes now show in the Order Manager.\n  - You can submit evidence to defend your case with the banks.\n  - You can check on the status of all your disputes to see if you won or lost.\n- Hiding Instagram gallery block upload option.","releaseDate":"2021-06-21"},{"versionDisplay":"3.43.8","releaseNotes":"I was walking down Venice Beach Boardwalk over the weekend and there was a crowd of people around a booth that said “Bitcoin Advice $5”.

It’s now a much roomier 30 days instead of 24 hours. It’s pretty chill. We fixed a bug where the mac app would hang indefinitely after tapping “publish” site. This was too chill, so we fixed that and now there’s no lag. Most importantly, Universe is for Everyone. That’s a truth that rings through every member of our team and we hope it comes through in our product.

It sounded to good to be true. I'm glad I was wrong! This app is the truth; ”the people app.” I never expected to also learn as much as I have about computer tech and codes. It's helped me build a couple Facebook business apps and discover a whole new world I never thought was possible. I started my website to address a social injustice involving my 5 month old African American son. Soon I realized I wanted to start a multi media company. To help give others a voice that could be heard.  I started Ryder Cash Media named after my son. There's is not enough time for me to tell you everything I love about this app.  Shoot for the moon!

Maybe with a main page and its subpages: you can anchor the background to all, and just have the other graphics basically slide over the background. \nAnd maybe other swipe effects/translations. \nI think for how simple it is, a lot of bases are touched, and basic major components are included. \n\nAnd maybe some of these features are included in pro. I have no idea lol. Just throwing some ideas out there for an already great program. \n\nThe more I mess around with it the more I’m leaning towards buying the lifetime pro account. It’s a very promising app. I just wish there was a trial so I can test all the pro features before deciding to spend money on it, however, I’m not too worried as I’m confident this would work perfect for what I need.","title":"Just started and I LOVE it!","userName":"Brandi.Victoria"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6490464856","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-02T01:57:37Z","developerResponse":{"id":18331009,"body":"Hi there - First off, thank you so much for the thoughtful review!

I’ll be reviewing this from a small business standpoint. I sell B2C and my products are very personalized and I’ve found ways to do just about everything I set out to. It holds close to these huge platforms like Shopify and BigCommerce. Apps would be nice. I see some huge potential if integrations become a thing here. \nI am honestly beyond stunned at the ease of adding and editing your context. It’s mind blowing how simple it is to do something on this app that take some time in others. The only reason I couldn’t give it 5 stars is because I can’t use this app for my online store....(insert sad face here) after doing the math I just can’t pay 10% of my transactions to any platform. It’s a LOT compared to others. Super bummed about it.\nThey do have options for cash app and PayPal...which is epic...but it takes away from the professional element in how I envision check out to feel for my clients.

To respond to your points:\n\n1. You can make a Universe site with as many pages as you want. In fact, sites on Universe have more pages on average than any other website builder. \n\n2. We handle domain registration as a service for our customers. This makes a typically complex and tedious process extremely simple. Several confirmations—both ours and Apple's—are presented before a purchase is made. We make this exceedingly clear. \n\n3. If you did in fact purchase a domain through us and no longer want to use Universe, we will help you move it to another provider. Just reach out to help@onuniverse.com.\n\nWe're doing our best as a small company to make something that people love. Sometimes we miss.

This app is a one page site, which is not a website, and you can’t sell anything, so you might as well call it a blog. It had glitches as well. It would freeze up from time to time. I was deceived when I signed up with the app. I didn’t know I was purchasing a domain name, and they purchase a domain through another service. I decided this app was not going to work for me, so now I have to keep my account open with them for one year. They won’t give me access to my own domain that I purchased. I have a shopify store, and need to buy an email with gsuite, but I can’t even do that, because I need to wait for Universe to log into my domain to finish setting it up. I have not heard back from Universe to do so. I am left waiting. Plus any issue I have with my domain. I have to wait for them to fix the problem. I am not that techno friendly, but I am learning as I go, and I pick on things real quickly. Making someone wait when it is something that can be fixed asap is not right. At least respond with questions in order to fix something. Universe fails to do so. Frustrating to say the least.

It has been incredibly well designed and has a very nice interface with easy to follow instructions and concepts. I think that design and development are moving to more things like this in which we can create more naturally without needing to learn skills such as coding. Don’t get me wrong, coding is very helpful and I have been learning it for the past year, but the more we can move past it and make the computer work for us instead of us needing to work according to the computer, the better computing will become.\n\nThere is a lot more that could be done with Universe however. It is still fairly restricted since you have to rely on the grid and their preset colors and options. This can certainly be a good thing for people who want that simplicity, but for people that are looking for more, there could be greater customization.","title":"Incredibly simple and beautiful","userName":"aberrantartist"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6628718161","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-11-10T08:56:05Z","developerResponse":{"id":19173092,"body":"Hey there!

A layer of control to balance out and land somewhere in between. Maybe a bigger yard. Or a weekend away. Maybe we just need to rearrange the furniture and clear the clutter.

This week we’re updating our Grid UI to make it easier to immerse yourself in that child-like sense of wonderment. First, we’re introducing a new, easy way to add blocks to your site. Simply tap the “add” button in the bottom left of the Grid and the familiar block picker will appear. When you pick a block it will find a spot on the grid, ready for your fingers to build. Next, Grid Controls are now easier to access with a settings button in the bottom left. From there, you can add rows to your site, change its background or theme, and adjust the grid’s density. Speaking of which, we’re adding something many of you have asked for: you can now go up to 7 columns wide for your site’s density. This will give you more room for blocks and for intricate designs. And you know that magical moment where you can grip and pull down another row of blocks onto the grid at the top of the editor? You can now pull up to add a row at the bottom of the grid as well.

Which brought me to the very engineer who asks me to write these release notes. (side note: no one asks for these release notes). Victor, who leads our iOS team, said “We use the app on a daily basis and run into the same issues some of our users encounter. Like us, they want the product to be better, and Polish Weeks are the perfect chance to focus on their requests. Some engineers will focus on fixing annoying bugs, while others will consider a highly requested feature. Because of that, Polish Weeks are magical - we never know what our engineers will be working on. By focusing on what’s important for our users, the results of these weeks are highly valuable and directly impactful.”  So that’s Polish Week.

Simply upload supporting documents — a picture of a crumpled up receipt might even do. Better yet, upload the shipping label, tracking number, or customer email thread, and voilà, the credit card company will have what they need for review. Then you will see any updates to the dispute in the app as they come in.

Previously, when you tried to drop a block over another one, it was like a game of cat and mouse, with the blocks magnetically opposed to taking up the same space. “Two things cannot occupy the same space.” We learn this in physics. At the other end of the hallway we conjugate verbs. The lessons sink in. They are learned. They give the world weight. They interpolate our reality. This city never sleeps. Eventually, things bubble up. We surface emotions. Expose our layers. Emerge. We are emergent. Without layering, there would be no texture. No overture. No resplendent arrangement of chords. So we learn and unlearn. We look to waves. Waves can occupy the same space at the same time. So maybe Block Layers are more like waves. Which we’re about to make.

You’d feel assured, calm, potentially terrified. But at least it’s not an anthropomorphized paper clip with undulating eyebrows.

When you create a site for the first time, a floating animation will show you how to resize, move, and edit blocks on your page. You can move it around the screen.

Or, to stretch the metaphor out into the infinite-- imagine a piece of dust catching a narrow sliver of light. As you reach out your hand to try and grab it, the spec slinks away. Some weightless, directionless force is pulling it away from you. You are the eye that catches the dust in the light.

This week we’re updating our Grid UI to make it easier to immerse yourself in that child-like sense of wonderment. First, we’re introducing a new, easy way to add blocks to your site. Simply tap the “add” button in the bottom left of the Grid and the familiar block picker will appear. When you pick a block it will find a spot on the grid, ready for your fingers to build. Next, Grid Controls are now easier to access with a settings button in the bottom left. From there, you can add rows to your site, change its background or theme, and adjust the grid’s density. Speaking of which, we’re adding something many of you have asked for: you can now go up to 7 columns wide for your site’s density. This will give you more room for blocks and for intricate designs. And you know that magical moment where you can grip and pull down another row of blocks onto the grid at the top of the editor? You can now pull up to add a row at the bottom of the grid as well. Enjoy!\n \nWhat’s New:\n• An easy way to add blocks to your site. Tap the new add button in the bottom  \n  left of the grid. You'll see the familiar block picker.

It’s a week we love. A week we look forward to. A week we talk about in our Monday kickoffs. People get excited. I get excited. Still, I wanted to do some digging into what makes Polish Week special. Which brought me to the very engineer who asks me to write these release notes. (side note: no one asks for these release notes). Victor, who leads our iOS team, said “We use the app on a daily basis and run into the same issues some of our users encounter. Like us, they want the product to be better, and Polish Weeks are the perfect chance to focus on their requests. Some engineers will focus on fixing annoying bugs, while others will consider a highly requested feature. Because of that, Polish Weeks are magical - we never know what our engineers will be working on. By focusing on what’s important for our users, the results of these weeks are highly valuable and directly impactful.”  So that’s Polish Week. It’s a chance for your opinions and frustrations to come through and be buffed out. All in the name of continual improvement.

Rather than correspond with our tip-top support team (who are all lovely, by the way), we’ve released a new flow by which any disputes are now displayed in-line with all your orders, so you can act on them right in the app. Indeed, swift action can be taken. Simply upload supporting documents — a picture of a crumpled up receipt might even do. Better yet, upload the shipping label, tracking number, or customer email thread, and voilà, the credit card company will have what they need for review. Then you will see any updates to the dispute in the app as they come in. Cheers!\n\n3.44.0 Specs\n- Disputes now show in the Order Manager.\n  - You can submit evidence to defend your case with the banks.\n  - You can check on the status of all your disputes to see if you won or lost.\n- Hiding Instagram gallery block upload option.","releaseDate":"2021-06-21"},{"versionDisplay":"3.43.8","releaseNotes":"I was walking down Venice Beach Boardwalk over the weekend and there was a crowd of people around a booth that said “Bitcoin Advice $5”.
