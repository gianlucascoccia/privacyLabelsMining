    Latest Update Broke the App!!
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Great update, guys!....NOT. Now the app keeps immediately crashing, as soon as it opens! I click the icon, to start app. I pull in 2 short videos to edit them together. I try to link them, before editing, and the app appears to just shut down. I restart app. It does it again. I try it again....same thing, but I then notice that it doesn’t completely close. It looks like it’s running in the background, as I see the app screen/window, when I double click home button (on iPad Pro.) I completely close the app out, (there are no other apps open) and click icon to start it again. It does the same thing..appears to close, (My home screen wallpaper is on screen) but I see the app is running in the background, as seen by once again double clicking home button. I completely close app out, again, and this time completely shut down the iPad, and restart it. Try to open app once more..surprise, it does the same thing as before...shuts down to background! The app is now totally unusable! It stays open for about 2 seconds each time I open it, and then crashes/app window disappears, as if it closed, but is running in background, and if I click on the app window to bring it up again, it just keeps doing the same thing!  The app had been working fine, before I installed the latest update.  What now?????</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>(I use the iPad Pro 2018 and both the iPad and the app&#39;s software are up to date)<br />I&#39;ve been having problems with the audio in my videos.<br />I thought it was just this one song i was trying to use at first but after trying several different songs, sound effects and other types of audio files, I keep having the same problem. The audio sounds fine when I&#39;m editing in the app but every time i save a video to my camera roll I notice clipping in the audio when i listen to it. I&#39;ve tried downloading the video with the volume turned down lower on every audio file in the video, I&#39;ve tried downloading the video in different Audio Quality&#39;s but nothing to works. The only way I&#39;ve gotten the audio to sound good is if i save the video with no audio, go into iMovie and edit in the audio in, then save that video. This makes things very difficult and annoying for me considering that most videos i create are music videos and/or videos with lots of sound effects. So if someone&#39;s got some advice or knows how to help me that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hello, we apologize for the frustrations. Try going into your &#39;Help and Settings&#39;, then tap on &quot;Preferences,&quot; then scroll down to where it says, &quot;Prefer Alternate Export.&quot; Turn off that switch. Now try to export again - did that fix the audio issues? If you need further assistance, please email us at support@luma-touch.com. Thank you!</p>

The audio sounds fine when I'm editing in the app but every time i save a video to my camera roll I notice clipping in the audio when i listen to it. I've tried downloading the video with the volume turned down lower on every audio file in the video, I've tried downloading the video in different Audio Quality's but nothing to works. The only way I've gotten the audio to sound good is if i save the video with no audio, go into iMovie and edit in the audio in, then save that video. This makes things very difficult and annoying for me considering that most videos i create are music videos and/or videos with lots of sound effects.

While overall things work well enough to get a decent edit done, when I went back to start adding music I found that every time I hit play the music starts from a different point in the song. As such it's impossible to edit to the beat when the beat changes every time, and from what I'm reading I'm not the only one who is experiencing this issue. Another different, non-deal breaker, yet still super annoying issue is the WD Passport support, or should I say lack thereof. While they advertise that you can edit directly from the drive and it'll only download the necessary footage, in practice the connection is so slow that its completely unuable. Not sure if this is an issue with the drive or LumaFusion. As such I've resorted back to just copying footage from the drive to a PNY lightning/USB flash drive then copying from there to my iPad. It's time consuming but it works and once the footage is on the iPad I can edit like normal without waiting for it to buffer. In the end I'm giving up on trying to travel light and still get edits done on the road and will be packing my laptop from now on so I can use a real video editor and save my sanity at the expense of my back. Bon Voyage.","title":"Audio syncing issues, WD Passport support is unusable","userName":"UATW"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2349570191","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-03-26T19:24:04Z","developerResponse":{"id":2966783,"body":"Hi Debohf.

I brought all of them into my first LumaFusion project. I started the project and moved two of them to the video timeline.  The iPhone was too small a platform to work on. Then I downloaded the app to my iPad with older iOS. My iOS was outdated. So then I bought a new iPad, with iOS 11.2.6 and downloaded my data from the cloud. When I downloaded the app to the new iPad, the 2 videos that I had added to the original video timeline when the project was on my iPhone were still in my photo/video folder, but the other videos were no where to be found! They were not on my iPhone nor in the cloud. Believe me, I checked multiple times! I lost hours of video time. I read after that there is the ability to delete material on your account from LumaFusion, but I don’t know how I did. If they were deleted via the app there should be a huge warning explaining what’s happening. I don’t remember doing anything that would have deleted any videos. I hardly did anything, given I could hardly work the app on the iPhone’s small screen. Anyone else seen this behavior? I like the functionality, but at this point, I’ll only use it after I back up my data separately before dragging any files into LF.","title":"Lost files","userName":"Debohf"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3113433527","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-08-25T18:34:01Z","rating":5,"review":"Luma Fusion is worth more than its price tag; it competes well against the likes of Adobe Premiere and Sony Vegas with its simplicity and efficiency. However, it lacks some (most used/ popular) effects that you may find the former having plenty of (both visual and audio). That doesn’t mean that it isn't worth the trouble; the precision, the control, the friendly UI and the overall organized file distribution, you can’t go wrong there.\n\nIt supports your everyday file formats and it can export your “movie” faster than Sony Vegas Pro, yet when it comes to editing, there are a few bugs (unfixed...?) and minor problems that may be annoying;\n- audio (only audio, not audio from video) can be off sync, when the file itself is 100% intact (this happens after scrolling forwards in the editing section)\n- preview may lag if you scroll through the editing fast and do a forceful stop to play a part of the video\n- it takes quite a bit to wait for the lag to go away\n- if the preview is played after these previous 2 events occur, the editing won’t scroll with the preview and when paused, will pause off sync to the preview (this is very complicated to explain...)\n- the audio waveforms (the white spikes that represent audio) aren’t precise; editing may be a bit difficult since it can be hard to do an exact cut + the audio being off sync\n\nHope these issues get dealt with as soon as the devs read this.

For everyone like me, who comes from Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro this is the best I’ve seen out there similar to those two power houses. Sure, this can’t beat those two, but for the price you get a lot that you get from AE and PR. I make edits as a hobby using AE, of animes, etc. So the one thing I’m used to using and love to do is have key frame transitions. I know that we have them here, but the one thing lacking is graphs. I typically use the graphs to make the transition, for example zoom in, go fast at the point I’d like to zoom in rather than it be at the same speed zooming in the entire transitions, as it does not look fast and keep the beat of the song up. Over all though, great app if you’re not in my place and are just looking for a good overall video editor that does most of everything you want it to do without the through the roof prices of other software out there.

It’s great for tweaking simple things like endings, or cutting parts out, etc. Also useful for more complicated videos when needed. I used pinnacle pro before and loved it and this app certainly improved upon it. The 4K support is awesome but if you have a long video can take time to load and everything will move much slower. A minor detail not applying to my needs very often. One of the stand outs among others is the incredible audio features. I won’t go into detail but it’s pretty extensive and feature full allowing you to adjust even the most minor audio details.\n\nIn closing and to reference my title , a surprising feature that is lacking is a simple reverb preset. When looking at all of the audio presets offered, not having a reverb seems silly. People are more familiar with Reverb then most other audio terms and is the most useful and easily applied. Having more in depth presets like Bandpass Filter, N-Band EQ, etc is great but I mean come on dude where’s the Reverb. \n\nThat is all.","title":"Great app but 1 thing I need","userName":"YouCrazyPug"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3444210596","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-11-21T18:28:57Z","developerResponse":{"id":6043515,"body":"Hello, We are very sorry you're having this experience.

The file is indeed there, playable, workable, but upon exporting an error is experienced. Optimize and consolidate does not always fix it. I can not simply re-edit this one media file, as I have spent hours on it. For the media to work in the project and then suddenly not upon export is infuriating. Is it corrupt or not? If so, perhaps let me know before I spend 6 hours working with a playable media file that is not “missing”, and very much so exists on the app. And I’m not about to upload 8 gigs to my photos every 10 minutes just to see if something magically became corrupted. I’ve dealt with it multiple times beforehand, but I just lost too much work to be content with this app currently.\nUpdate: even after deleting the media file and reimporting it upon export I got the same error.
