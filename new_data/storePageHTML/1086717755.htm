Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app lets you use Siri and Apple Watch to control your Nest Thermostat!<br />It also lets you see HomeKit Thermostat info on the Watch Complications.<br /><br />Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.<br /><br />＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).<br /><br />＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.<br />_____________<br /><br />• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It&#39;s all finally just one casual &quot;Hey Siri&quot; away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.<br />• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.<br />• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.<br />• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.<br /><br />The app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.<br /><br />The app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.<br /><br />Monitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.<br /><br />You can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as &quot;Start Heating&quot; or &quot;Make it Cooler&quot;. If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example &quot;Start Heating Upstairs&quot; or &quot;Start Cooling the Living Room&quot;.<br /><br />Visit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.<br /><br />Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.<br /><br />The app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.<br /><br />Beyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.<br /><br />While the app&#39;s minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don&#39;t show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.<br /><br />Thermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.<br />This app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc.</p>

Thanks to Charlie for pointing this out!<br /><br />Previous major updates:<br />＊ Home Screen Widget on iOS 14.<br />＊ You can sign in with a Google or a Nest account to both the iOS app, and the Apple TV app.<br />＊ You can save both the Google account and Nest account API Key from the app menu. As usual, it&#39;s advisable to do this.<br />＊ Watch app can now display temperatures from Nest temperature sensors. To do this, press the watch screen firmly.<br />＊ Tip Jar added to the app menu. If Watch Cam has changed your home experience for the better, please consider giving a small tip.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>***UPDATE*** <br />Marko replied to my response immediately, and knew the issue right away, I’m brand new to Nest Thermostat and Google changed a few things. Although he was unable to resolve it, he was very willing to refund me the purchased price. He gave me a very detailed reason why (the Google/Nest transition) it isn’t working. He is working on a solution to the problem, and hopefully will have it resolved soon. He was very pleasant to work with, and again, I love the Camera app he created. Just waiting for the bugs to be removed for me. Overall, great developer, very professional, and a pleasure to work with. (I would give a 5 because of his help, but the app still doesn’t work for me)<br /><br />Previous - When I try and log in through the app on my phone, using my nest account, it says I must use the main users account information, which I am. The camera app they have works well but this doesn’t work.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I started with a couple of Nest Thermostats in my home, but after Google stopped authorizing keys for new app integrations &amp; a need to access with some new software, decided to use Ecobee for the rest of my house &amp; will eventually replace Existing Nest with Ecobee. Unfortunately, I can not find any way to link Ecobee account to the app. I’ve searched the developers website and find plenty of information on linking to Nest, but not a word on Ecobee. If you are not supporting Ecobee, then remove it from the app name.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY, while the developer states that I only need to add the thermostats to my HomeKit configuration, then connect through the app, it doesn’t work. I already had all of my thermostats connected to HomeKit. I connected to HomeKit, when I installed each Thermostat. (They all show up in the Home app, along with the remote sensors) The ThermoWatch app doesn’t give me an option of connecting to my HomeKit Devices, the closest option is to Authorize my AppleTV (HomeKit Hub). That doesn’t work either. Those instructions refer to connecting to a Nest Thermostat. Running the AppleTV app, when selecting this option on the phone, doesn’t do anything at all.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi Wulfeman. The Ecobee thermostats are supported in this app when they are added to your HoneKit setup. Then you just choose the “Connect to your HomeKit Thermostat” from the app’s first screen, and they will show up in the app. You can then control them from the iOS app, the Widget, Apple Watch, and Apple TV.<br />Please note that with this app you can choose to control Nest thermostats, or HomeKit thermostats, but not both at the same time.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been using this app for quite a while and it’s great. Typically what happens is I actually end up taking control of some of the settings while I’m in bed as I’m going to sleep on my Apple Watch. It’s amazingly good.<br /><br />I had trouble because one of my thermostats the battery ran out or stopped charging very well so I had to replace the thermostat and there was some settings that required multiple steps. I sent an email to the developer he reached out to me with detailed instructions which have completely solve the problem which I would not have been able to determine on my own. I really do appreciate all of the help.<br /><br />I think that before anybody write a bad review you should reach out to the developer he seems to be incredibly helpful. And I think that when you have issues it’s likely more a function of googles nest thermostat and it is with this application and reaching out to him seems to be very beneficial</p>

The app will set your home into Away state (which can set the thermostat into Eco mode) as soon as the phone exits the defined perimeter - and back into Home state when you get back in. You will receive notifications that confirm the Home/Away state has been successfully set, when these events happen. You can set the perimeter to be anything from very small, to several miles in radius.

To set up fences, press the menu button in the top left, and select the option from the menu. Make sure to \"Always Allow\" location updates, as geofencing won't work otherwise.

You will also be asked if you wish to receive notifications from the app. Notifications are sent to confirm that the Home/Away state has been successfully changed, after you cross the fence perimeter.\n\nPrevious major updates:\n＊ The app now displays much bigger and more readable thermostat circle on your iPhone and iPad, which scales down for users with multiple thermostats, to avoid having to scroll unnecessarily. Thermostat circle is also smoothly animated now, as the temperature changes.\n\n＊ Using Siri voice shortcuts you can now control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, direct setting of your favorite temperatures, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state.

Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data.

Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest.

On May 16, Google / Nest have announced that while the \"Works With Nest\" program will end on August 31, 2019, apps like this one will continue working indefinitely, as long as you do not migrate your Nest account onto a Google account. This is a really great news for all of the existing users, as there's now no danger of this app dying on you - and I will do my best to apply to Google's new security screening process, so that the app will also work for the new users, who join after the August 31.\n\nPrevious major updates:\n＊ Geofencing support. The app will set your home into Away state (which can set the thermostat into Eco mode) as soon as the phone exits the defined perimeter - and back into Home state when you get back in. You will receive notifications that confirm the Home/Away state has been successfully set, when these events happen. You can set the perimeter to be anything from very small, to several miles in radius. Use this feature if you are for any reason not happy with the similar functionality provided by the main Nest app. Note that if someone else stays at home when you exit the perimeter, your home will soon go back into Home state, when thermostat picks up motion activity inside the home.\n\n＊ Each of your Nest homes can have one geofence. To set up fences, press the menu button in the top left, and select the option from the menu. Make sure to \"Always Allow\" location updates, as geofencing won't work otherwise. The app uses your location only to change the Home/Away state, and never sends your location anywhere. You will also be asked if you wish to receive notifications from the app. Notifications are sent to confirm that the Home/Away state has been successfully changed, after you cross the fence perimeter.\n\nPrevious major updates:\n＊ The app now displays much bigger and more readable thermostat circle on your iPhone and iPad, which scales down for users with multiple thermostats, to avoid having to scroll unnecessarily. Thermostat circle is also smoothly animated now, as the temperature changes.\n\n＊ Using Siri voice shortcuts you can now control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, direct setting of your favorite temperatures, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state.
