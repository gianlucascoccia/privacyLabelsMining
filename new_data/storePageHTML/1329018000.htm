        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I want to start off by saying how happy I am that I got this subscription for me and my girlfriend to watch and get into the DC universe together . The shows they have on here , are absolutely top tier . I see that many of the reviews on here are talking about how the app crashes , but they were mostly a year ago I’m sure , correct me if I’m wrong . This app has no crashed on me once and it has been 3 months . Another thing that I see is being mentioned is inconsistent flow of new content , now I understand it can be annoying but I honestly think the amazing shows that are on here make up for it . Like I said I’ve only had it for 3 months but I’m 90 percent sure that all the bad reviews this app was given have been read by the devs and taken care of ! I actually just saw them put more content and animated movies last week ! What I’m trying to say is the flaws that were mentioned in previous reviews have been taken care of , which goes to show this team handling DC universe is amazing ! And to top of it all of this is only 8 dollars a month ! I highly recommend. It was the best subscription I had bought this year .</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Huge DC fan. Been a sub since this app came out. But I have written the devs numerous times the past year and half.  Telling them how I need to restart the app a few times before it will actually let u use it..they always say they know of the issue and will have it fixed shortly and stuff like that.  Yet been almost 2 years now and numerous contacts with devs. 5 times have written them or gave a written comment. Also really would love to have the devs put all their content they have on the app.  Does drive me batty that so many movies, series and animated stuff aren’t on here, yet have been out for years. Instead they put out some stuff for few months, take it off and put a few different old stuff on.  Heck put it all on all the time like your competitor Marvel does.. <br /><br />Am glad they have given us a better selection to comics and made a lot of more ease of use to the consumer on finding the comics you want and have all the others of the same title easy to find. Rem. When they would put out a lot of comics. But they Weren’t complete at all, for instance a older comic may have a series of 56 in the set yet they would have only 30 on the app. So extremely happy they have gotten a lot better with the comics but still room for improvement. Still missing some issues In a series. <br /><br />All and all love DC so will continue to pay my sub hoping that they will give us a lot more content to watch and read then they do know and just keep it on at all times.</p>

    Download Videos but still Needs Service

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So I just downloaded this app yesterday and I was so excited to see all the content that was available. So I downloaded a lot of episodes and movies. I went to work the next day, which Is a manufacturing company. So I have no service. But I didn’t think anything of it because I download everything. I went on my break, open the app and it doesn’t work because it needs cellular data. So what’s the point of downloading if I need cellular data to watch. The WHOLE point of downloading is so you can watch without using data. This is completely pointless and makes no sense. I have Netflix and I download movies and shows all the time. So when I watch it, it works great, because I downloaded it! I don’t understand why this app can’t do this especially when you pay for it. So eventually I turn my cellular data on and got a little service, but the playback was blurry. Even from the ones I downloaded under Wi-Fi. This is my first time using this app and I had such a bad experience. I was so excited to use it and all of his features but it’s sad that I can’t get the full experience because it requires data. I think this is a simple fix that should be addressed. I should be able to open my app and once it sees that I have no cellular data, then it should automatically go to my downloaded library. This is exactly what Netflix and other apps do and it’s very simple. Please fix this</p>

Earth.  The Floral Femme Fatale uses her own natural pheromones to control whomever she wants.  Her ability to control the floral life around her gives her an instant army against anyone who tries to stop her and foolishly get in her way.  She's not a two-dimensional criminal in the traditional sense and has proven herself compassionate time and time again as one of Batman's most conflicted and complex villains.  Our latest contribution to the DCU experience includes a healthy mix of new features and improved performance.","releaseDate":"2020-04-28"},{"versionDisplay":"2.10","releaseNotes":"The DC Universe “Oracle” update is named in honor of Barbara Gordon’s amazing cyber alias.

We may work with reputable third parties to present advertisements, and engage in data collection, reporting, ad delivery and response measurement, and site analytics on our Sites and on third party websites across the Internet and applications over time. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, or similar technologies to perform this activity. They may also obtain information about applications you use, websites you visit, and other information from across your devices and browsers in order to help serve advertising that may be more relevant to your interests on and off our Sites and across your devices and browsers. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising. They may also use this information to associate various browsers and devices together for the purpose of interest-based advertising and other purposes like analytics.\n\nFor more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser, and your ability to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in self-regulatory programs, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative and/or the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about interest-based advertising in mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA’s AppChoices tool, please download the version of AppChoices for your device here. Please note that any opt-out choice you exercise through these programs will apply to interest-based advertising by the third parties you select, but will still allow the collection of data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations. You may continue to receive advertising, but that advertising may be less relevant to your interests.\n\nYou may have more options depending on your mobile device and operating system. For example, most device operating systems (e.g., iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to learn more about these features and how they apply to tailored in-app advertisements.\n\nPrecise location information.

The shows they have on here , are absolutely top tier . I see that many of the reviews on here are talking about how the app crashes , but they were mostly a year ago I’m sure , correct me if I’m wrong . This app has no crashed on me once and it has been 3 months . Another thing that I see is being mentioned is inconsistent flow of new content , now I understand it can be annoying but I honestly think the amazing shows that are on here make up for it . Like I said I’ve only had it for 3 months but I’m 90 percent sure that all the bad reviews this app was given have been read by the devs and taken care of ! I actually just saw them put more content and animated movies last week ! What I’m trying to say is the flaws that were mentioned in previous reviews have been taken care of , which goes to show this team handling DC universe is amazing ! And to top of it all of this is only 8 dollars a month ! I highly recommend. It was the best subscription I had bought this year .","title":"This Subscription Is Awesome.

Been a sub since this app came out. But I have written the devs numerous times the past year and half.  Telling them how I need to restart the app a few times before it will actually let u use it..they always say they know of the issue and will have it fixed shortly and stuff like that.  Yet been almost 2 years now and numerous contacts with devs. 5 times have written them or gave a written comment. Also really would love to have the devs put all their content they have on the app.  Does drive me batty that so many movies, series and animated stuff aren’t on here, yet have been out for years. Instead they put out some stuff for few months, take it off and put a few different old stuff on.  Heck put it all on all the time like your competitor Marvel does.. \n\nAm glad they have given us a better selection to comics and made a lot of more ease of use to the consumer on finding the comics you want and have all the others of the same title easy to find. Rem. When they would put out a lot of comics. But they Weren’t complete at all, for instance a older comic may have a series of 56 in the set yet they would have only 30 on the app. So extremely happy they have gotten a lot better with the comics but still room for improvement. Still missing some issues In a series. \n\nAll and all love DC so will continue to pay my sub hoping that they will give us a lot more content to watch and read then they do know and just keep it on at all times.","title":"Good but can be a lot better","userName":"nice746"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4482001088","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-07-18T22:21:04Z","developerResponse":{"id":9751961,"body":"We're sorry for the trouble you've experienced attempting to view downloaded DC Universe content.

I went on my break, open the app and it doesn’t work because it needs cellular data. So what’s the point of downloading if I need cellular data to watch. The WHOLE point of downloading is so you can watch without using data. This is completely pointless and makes no sense. I have Netflix and I download movies and shows all the time. So when I watch it, it works great, because I downloaded it! I don’t understand why this app can’t do this especially when you pay for it. So eventually I turn my cellular data on and got a little service, but the playback was blurry. Even from the ones I downloaded under Wi-Fi. This is my first time using this app and I had such a bad experience. I was so excited to use it and all of his features but it’s sad that I can’t get the full experience because it requires data. I think this is a simple fix that should be addressed. I should be able to open my app and once it sees that I have no cellular data, then it should automatically go to my downloaded library.

As I feel I’m the biggest fan of the DC creative world. I’ll get right to it. \nFirst of all, it’s pretty poor of this site to encourage people to subscribe when there isn't a constant flow of content being added. Specifically the Young Justice: Outsiders animated series. This series is a cartoon and I feel that it’s wrong to give us a measly 8 or so episodes and make us wait several months for the new season. It’s a cartoon. No one is going to care once those months are up and the new season is out. \nSecondly, comics are no longer downloadable for me and I know I still have data space to install on. I’m happy with the Titans TV series. It’s very realistic as it should be because DC is about what’s real, not the pretty and magical focus that Marvel has. \nFurthermore, I think in-addition to the Outsiders animated series you should add a Red Hood and the Outlaws animated series. Very explicit and mature rated for adults. Recently got into the comic and it’s very good. Just a few things I discovered that would help.\nLastly, why is this app that I pay for not up to date with these Batman comics? I’m hearing about Three Jokers and from what I can see this app has even finished the City of Bane arc. That’s ridiculous. We should be receiving the content as it’s released. Because we subscribe. We shouldn’t be out of the loop like this. We’re fans.","title":"Untitled","userName":"Informed Rizza"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4829039589","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-09-23T16:50:51Z","developerResponse":{"id":10869457,"body":"We're sorry for the trouble you've experienced in DC Universe and sincerely appreciate your detailed feedback.

My problem is that there are shows here that don’t include the entire run time. For example, this app only has two seasons of the four Batman Animated series seasons. So, does that mean I’m expected to finish these two seasons here, and then go pay for the other seasons elsewhere? Sure, maybe you’ll make a couple more bucks that way, but you’ll lose my trust as a (for now) subscriber. No one wants to feel cheated. If you own the show, why wouldn’t you just put up the whole series so that people keep faith in your integrity? Or is that it, is there no integrity? What if the fifth season of Titans comes out, but then they suddenly decide not to put it on the app? Am I going to have to pay for the fifth season on Blu-Ray? I know this isn’t likely but my point is, if you have people paying for your service, you should give them 100% of the shows you have listed, especially if they’re twenty years old. Sure I’ll subscribe for now, but this poor business model will certainly have me cancel after some time. I wouldn’t mind the monthly charge if I felt like I was really being taken care of. I’m sure Disney+ wouldn’t do this, but hey I guess Warner Brothers will have to learn the hard way","title":"Good package, but they expect you to pay more for things you’d expect to have","userName":"Frank thank"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3233431330","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-09-26T20:54:17Z","rating":5,"review":"When I first heard about the service I was wary to pay for a whole year in case I didn’t want the service after a month or so… After two weeks I have to say I am completely satisfied. Not only is there an abundance of material to look into there’s a whole community of people that just want to chat about things that you want to chat about. To me that’s the best part. If you’re going in looking to get all the latest blockbuster movies and all the latest blockbuster comics then you’ll be upset. If you’ve already started collecting all the rebirth comics and own all the DCEU movies then this is the next step! There full strings of comics I never would’ve paid for but have always wanted to read. As a 22 year old I missed out on everything before 2000.... so I just used wiki. This has been so nice to read old comics and watch old shows. Plus the new animated movies are fiiire. I just can’t even believe it hasn’t been two weeks and it can only get better.

Apple charged me, the money went out of my account right into DC Universe’s and I still can’t play my shows. Every time I try to play a show, it will give me the options for the subscriptions. Knowing that I had already paid I pressed skip these options until I realized that the subscription options won’t go away. To try to entertain what was happening in front of me, I tapped on the 7.99 subscription plan (which I already had) and after I did, it told me I already have the subscription! So what gives? Why can’t I watch the content that I paid for? Why isn’t there a call line that can help loyal paying customers figure out what’s going on more directly? For months since using the app for streaming it’s shows, it’s always been a choppy app. Always slow, glitching, or lagging behind. It’s becoming quite frustrating to keep up with. I just need help so I could watch Titans, but with a lack of a call line, I might not get. Be weary when getting this app. There are definitely positives content wise, but the mechanics of this app makes you wanna throw your phone across the room sometimes lol.","title":"Great Content.

The filter in the comics section, how it is interacted with, and the how we open comics in general is just flat out atrocious. I literally groan when it comes to searching for specific content in storylines or by eras because the filter options seem to reset every time I so much as look at anything else. No option exist for jumping back into specific storylines, so if I want to go back to reading a main series and all the tie-ins, not only can I not do that from the recently read section, but I have to go back and use the (again, atrocious) comic filter to jump back into what I was reading. An option should exist to favorite specific eras, storylines, heroes, etc. to allow readers to jump back into content.","title":"Love the content!

Ever since I’ve been going through storylines by the boatload. The plethora of movies and tv shows is a lot of fun as well. My biggest complaints are that crossover comics don’t streamlined at all. Issues will end with “story continued in (insert issue here)” but that issue isn’t linked or any where close to where you are reading the current issue. This brings me to my second issue: finding individual comic issues is insanely difficult. You can search for a storyline and get completely unrelated comics but not the ones you are looking for. For example: I searched for Robin #130 as it was listed at the end of a different issue I was reading. Rather than getting a selection of Robin comics sorted by those sharing the specifications I searched I get “Catwoman #3” or “Teen Titans Year One”. It seems like the search engine prioritizes individual parts of a search over the entire search itself. \n\nAlso- the amount of movies that are missing is kinda ridiculous. No Batman vs. Robin, no Batman Bad blood despite them both being a part of the Animated Movie Universe is kinda crazy","title":"Love the service but it needs some tuning","userName":"Shmmitty"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3262076644","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-10-04T09:22:59Z","rating":5,"review":"Ok guys, that is still a work in progress, still with its current minor glitches, this service is 100% worth it and just heaven for DC fans. I very much would like to see more comics, specifically, complete graphic novels. I don’t expect DC to give away new content, but I don’t see the point of, for example, releasing only the first issue of older classics like Red Son.  This is a bit frustrating, especially since I own it, and it would be so more convenient than digging my sealed old issues. \n\nThe streaming is near perfect, the Daily DC show is great, the animation selection is great and so are the DC catalog releases through the Nolan Trilogy. I’d love to see the Zack Snyder movies, uncut, and if they wanted to blow the subscriptions out of the water #releasethegoddamSnyderCut (tip of the hat to Frank Miller).\n\nAs is, this is a great service out of the box, and don’t tell DC, but I’d pay twice the price for this geek’s DC love fest. Yes, I love the DC Universe Streaming Service.  Can’t wait for the original content, especially Doom Patrol. If you love DC, don’t miss this great service.","title":"A glimpse of great things to
