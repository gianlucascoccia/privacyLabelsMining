        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Below is my rating from when the app first appeared a few years ago. It wasn’t good. It’s now amazing. I use Chromecast to take it with me on the road and in my condo’s gym. Great, great workouts. <br /><br />Old review:<br />I guess the utility of the app depends upon your goals. If your goal is heart rate training (HRT), or some sort of high intensity fitness training, there are better videos on You Tube. If your goal is to pass the time with a certain type of music, and get &quot;life coaching&quot; from a yoga teacher, then this app will work for you. I found Steve Little to be the best, most serious instructor. I found Nicole Meline to be one I wanted to mute as she offered empty platitudes like &quot;make yourself essential&quot;, &quot;paint a new masterpiece today&quot;, &quot;you don&#39;t have to accept that inheritance&quot;. Huh? I&#39;m looking to work hard and get my heart rate up to 90-93% That isn&#39;t a goal of this program. Apparently, helping the depressed is. What they need to do to cater to serious fitness folks: get some graphics on the screen: heart rate as a percent of maximum; cadence; resistance,; effort level; segment time; total time. Instead, you&#39;re gonna get &quot;favorite playlists&quot;. That&#39;s fine for the Lululemon yoga pants in the grocery store &quot;athlete&quot;, but how about something for the serious folks? They clearly have the technology. For me, it&#39;s back to You Tube videos.  I&#39;ll check back in six months. Maybe they&#39;ll come around.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been a Peloton bike user (in my building gym) for a year and a half.  I was doing workouts 5 days/wk. When the COVID-19 crisis started unfolding. As many things started changing the directive to close gyms came to fruition &amp; my building complied and closed our gym facilities. <br />I knew I’d be able to “deal” with the changes put into place however, one thing that really annoyed me was that I’d have to stop my 5 day a week habit that I have painstakinly made part of my daily week day regimen.  I did not want to break this habit. <br />This is where this app came in!  Peloton brilliantly extended a 90 day trial for their app. I am hooked!  I plan on keeping my membership and plan to incorporate it into my routine. I have been able to keep up with workouts from the same people who I have grown to love and more.  While, its not the cycling part I was able to seamelssly continue a workout routine.  Once things start to reopen I will go back to cycling but I definitely will want the other workouts that were not currenty part of using the gym bike. <br />I love the variety of workouts, instrutors, playlists...one thing I would love to see is an ability to create a workout “playlist”. Sometimes I want to exercise for 60 minutes total and  I like to do 2 30 minute workouts. I would love the ability to select the 2 workouts and have them play in selected order.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Been using the app for workouts for the last 4 months and I am obsessed with it. Am particularly keen on the treadmill workouts - I love running outdoors but it’s not always practical and boy does this app take away from the monotony of treadmill running. It even spurred me on to my faster 5k, 10k and 1 mile distances for the last 3 years in the short time I have been using it. I love the ranges provided so you can measure profession by taking the same class, the instructors are inspiring, the user experience is sleek and uncomplicated. I too would love to be able to interact with my contacts a bit more (get notifications of them finishing workouts etc.) and see if they signed up for the same live classes - there is a sense of community already but I think it could be built on. As an app user, I’d love the ability to rate the workouts after I complete them to more easily return to the ones I enjoyed most. Personally a bit more information on the run itself would be useful I.e 4 min work up, followed by 3 min sprint intervals followed by 3 mins hill intervals etc. But these are minor points - I have already converted 5+ friends to the app and am thinking of getting the treadmill itself because I love the whole idea so much! #teampeloton</p>

Policy\nEffective Date of Current Policy: December 27, 2019\n1. PURPOSE\nWelcome to our Privacy Policy! Peloton Interactive, Inc. (formerly Peloton Interactive, LLC) together with our affiliates (\"Peloton\", \"we\", or \"us\") have adopted this Privacy Policy to let you know how we treat the information that we collect from you online and offline, the kinds of information we may collect, how that information is used, with whom we share it and how you can opt-out of a use or correct or change such information. This Privacy Policy supplements and forms a part of the Peloton Terms of Service (the \"Terms\"). Capitalized terms not defined in Section 13 or otherwise in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms.\n2. SCOPE\nThis Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that is Processed by Peloton in the course of our business, including via the Peloton Site, the interfaces on tablets connected to Peloton fitness equipment such as the Peloton Bike and Tread, and through our, Apps, forums, social media accounts, blogs, studios, retail showrooms, and other online or offline offerings (together with any and all future online and offline offerings operated by or on behalf of Peloton, the \"Services\"). All individuals whose responsibilities include the Processing of Personal Information on behalf of Peloton are expected to protect that data by adherence to this Privacy Policy.\nResidents of California should be aware that California law affords them certain rights regarding their Personal Information. Residents of California should review the California Privacy Notice that supplements and forms a part of this Privacy Policy. The California Privacy Notice is available at, www.onepeloton.com/california-privacy-notice.\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to Personal Information of Peloton employees Processed in the employment context, but employees who elect to use the Services will be treated as users in accordance with this Privacy Policy with respect to Personal Information Processed as users of our Service.\n3. TRANSPARENCY/NOTICE—TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT\nThe types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from third party sources) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with Peloton and the requirements of applicable law. Some of the ways that Peloton may collect Personal Information include:\n\t•\tYou may provide Personal Information directly to Peloton through interacting with the Services (including when you use our fitness equipment during live in-studio classes or via our subscription services), participating in surveys, during events such as Homecoming, or promotions or sweepstakes, and requesting services or information.\n\t•\tAs you navigate the Services, certain passive information may also be collected about your visit, including through cookies and similar technologies as described below.\nIt is our goal to collect only that information which is relevant for the purposes of Processing. Below are the ways we collect Personal Information and how we use it.\n3.1 TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT\nPeloton collects Personal Information from its current, prospective, and former customers, members, users, visitors, and guests (collectively \"Individuals\").\n\t•\tInformation You Provide Directly to Us. When you use the Services, contact us directly, or engage in certain activities, such as registering for an account with Peloton, purchasing Peloton products or Services from us, using our fitness equipment or participating in a studio class live or via our subscription services, we may ask you to provide some or all of the following types of information\n\t•\tPurchases. When you choose to purchase Peloton products or Services from us including fitness equipment and accessories, apparel, live in-studio classes or subscription services offered through any device, we may collect information from you including Personal Information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, payment information, such as a credit card number and/or other related information that may be required from you to complete your purchase (such payment information, \"Financial Information\"). Unless we tell you otherwise at the time of your purchase or application for financing, your Financial Information is Processed by our third party processors and we do not collect, store or maintain your Financial Information. For more information on how your information is shared in these instances, please see Section 3.5 (\"Third-Party Payment Processing\") below. We will also collect a username and password in connection with any account created via the Services.\n\t•\tPublic User Profiles. When you use Peloton fitness equipment (e.g., the Bike or Tread) or subscribe to Peloton Digital, you will be given the opportunity to create a “User Profile” and when you do so we may ask you to provide information about yourself such as a username, email address, weight, height, age, location, birthday, phone number and image or avatar. Only your email address and username are required to set up a User Profile; the rest of the information that you may provide is optional.Once your User Profile is created, anytime you log in to participate in a studio class in-person or via our subscription service, we will collect additional information and add it to your User Profile, such as the total number of classes taken, the dates you took those classes, fitness performance history (including leaderboard rank, achievements earned, total output, speed, distance and calories burned), your followers and who you are following, and, to the extent you have worn a heart rate monitor that you have connected to your fitness equipment, information about your heart rate over the course of the class and any other information that may be available from time to time.\u2028You acknowledge that your User Profile information may be personal to you, and by creating an account and providing such information through the use of our Services, you allow others, including Peloton, to identify you and therefore you may not be anonymous.

For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt-out on each device. Advertisements on third party websites that contain the AdChoices link, and that link to this Privacy Policy, may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites.

To protect your privacy, Peloton will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.\n7.

PURPOSE\nWelcome to our Privacy Policy! Peloton Interactive, Inc. (formerly Peloton Interactive, LLC) together with our affiliates (\"Peloton\", \"we\", or \"us\") have adopted this Privacy Policy to let you know how we treat the information that we collect from you online and offline, the kinds of information we may collect, how that information is used, with whom we share it and how you can opt-out of a use or correct or change such information. This Privacy Policy supplements and forms a part of the Peloton Terms of Service (the \"Terms\"). Capitalized terms not defined in Section 13 or otherwise in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms.\n2. SCOPE\nThis Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that is Processed by Peloton in the course of our business, including via the Peloton Site, the interfaces on tablets connected to Peloton fitness equipment such as the Peloton Bike and Tread, and through our, Apps, forums, social media accounts, blogs, studios, retail showrooms, and other online or offline offerings (together with any and all future online and offline offerings operated by or on behalf of Peloton, the \"Services\"). All individuals whose responsibilities include the Processing of Personal Information on behalf of Peloton are expected to protect that data by adherence to this Privacy Policy.\nResidents of California should be aware that California law affords them certain rights regarding their Personal Information. Residents of California should review the California Privacy Notice that supplements and forms a part of this Privacy Policy. The California Privacy Notice is available at, www.onepeloton.com/california-privacy-notice.\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to Personal Information of Peloton employees Processed in the employment context, but employees who elect to use the Services will be treated as users in accordance with this Privacy Policy with respect to Personal Information Processed as users of our Service.\n3. TRANSPARENCY/NOTICE—TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT\nThe types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from third party sources) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with Peloton and the requirements of applicable law. Some of the ways that Peloton may collect Personal Information include:\n\t•\tYou may provide Personal Information directly to Peloton through interacting with the Services (including when you use our fitness equipment during live in-studio classes or via our subscription services), participating in surveys, during events such as Homecoming, or promotions or sweepstakes, and requesting services or information.\n\t•\tAs you navigate the Services, certain passive information may also be collected about your visit, including through cookies and similar technologies as described below.\nIt is our goal to collect only that information which is relevant for the purposes of Processing. Below are the ways we collect Personal Information and how we use it.\n3.1 TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT\nPeloton collects Personal Information from its current, prospective, and former customers, members, users, visitors, and guests (collectively \"Individuals\").\n\t•\tInformation You Provide Directly to Us. When you use the Services, contact us directly, or engage in certain activities, such as registering for an account with Peloton, purchasing Peloton products or Services from us, using our fitness equipment or participating in a studio class live or via our subscription services, we may ask you to provide some or all of the following types of information\n\t•\tPurchases. When you choose to purchase Peloton products or Services from us including fitness equipment and accessories, apparel, live in-studio classes or subscription services offered through any device, we may collect information from you including Personal Information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, payment information, such as a credit card number and/or other related information that may be required from you to complete your purchase (such payment information, \"Financial Information\"). Unless we tell you otherwise at the time of your purchase or application for financing, your Financial Information is Processed by our third party processors and we do not collect, store or maintain your Financial Information. For more information on how your information is shared in these instances, please see Section 3.5 (\"Third-Party Payment Processing\") below. We will also collect a username and password in connection with any account created via the Services.\n\t•\tPublic User Profiles. When you use Peloton fitness equipment (e.g., the Bike or Tread) or subscribe to Peloton Digital, you will be given the opportunity to create a “User Profile” and when you do so we may ask you to provide information about yourself such as a username, email address, weight, height, age, location, birthday, phone number and image or avatar. Only your email address and username are required to set up a User Profile; the rest of the information that you may provide is optional.Once your User Profile is created, anytime you log in to participate in a studio class in-person or via our subscription service, we will collect additional information and add it to your User Profile, such as the total number of classes taken, the dates you took those classes, fitness performance history (including leaderboard rank, achievements earned, total output, speed, distance and calories burned), your followers and who you are following, and, to the extent you have worn a heart rate monitor that you have connected to your fitness equipment, information about your heart rate over the course of the class and any other information that may be available from time to time.\u2028You acknowledge that your User Profile information may be personal to you, and by creating an account and providing such information through the use of our Services, you allow others, including Peloton, to identify you and therefore you may not be anonymous. Information included in your User Profile, including any achievements, milestones, streaks or badges earned via the Services may be displayed on in-studio digital signage if you come to a live class at any of our studios. Peloton User Profiles are set to public by default, which means that other registered Peloton users will also be able to view your User Profile, including your fitness performance history (as described above), your Peloton leaderboard name, and your location and age (if you have provided it), and those users can contact or follow you through the Services. You have the option to set your profile to “Private,” which means that only members who you approve as followers can see your profile and fitness performance history, and you can remove other users from your followers.\u2028\n\t•\tVoice and Likeness. We may capture your visual image, likeness and voice recording (e.g., via photographs and/or video) if you visit our studios and/or showrooms, participate in studio classes and/or call our member support or inside sales teams. We record and store member support and sales calls to train support and sales agents to help resolve member questions, for quality purposes and as required by law. Additionally, Peloton fitness equipment and the Peloton App may contain a camera, microphone and voice control features. These features are in use only when activated by you, for example, to take a Peloton user profile photo or to initiate or accept a video chat from another user.\n\t•\tOther User Information. Peloton may also collect other information from you as a result of your use of the Services, such as in-studio attendance history, purchase history, fitness and health related information. We may associate this information with other Personal Information that you have provided in order to improve and provide the Services and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.\n\t•\tCommunications with Us. We may collect Personal Information from you such as your email address, phone number or mailing address, when you choose to request information about our Services, visit our retail showrooms, register to receive Peloton communications over email or text messaging, participate in promotions, or loyalty programs that we may offer from time to time, request to receive member or technical support or otherwise communicate with us.\n\t•\tSurveys and Reviews. From time to time, we (or third parties acting on our behalf) may contact you to participate in research, surveys or beta testing or to provide reviews and testimonials. If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information, which may include Personal Information. All information collected from your participation in our research, surveys, reviews or testimonial process, or beta testing is provided by you voluntarily. We may use such information to improve our products, our Site and/or Services, and in any manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.\n\t•\tPosting on the Peloton or Third Party Services. Peloton may offer publicly accessible blogs, social media pages, product review pages, private messages, video chat or community forums. You should be aware that, when you disclose information about yourself on Peloton’s blogs, social media pages, product review pages, private messages, community forums, and within video chat sessions, Peloton will collect the information you provide in such submissions, including any Personal Information. If you choose to submit content, including reviews, to any public area of the Services or on any public sites operated by third parties, such content will be considered “public” and will not be subject to the privacy protections provided in this Privacy Policy.\n\t•\tRegistration for Sweepstakes or Contests. Occasionally, Peloton may run sweepstakes and contests. We ask those who enter sweepstakes or contests to provide contact information (e.g., a phone number or an email address). If you participate in a sweepstakes or contest, your contact information may be used to reach you about the sweepstakes or contest, and, to the extent permitted by law, for other promotional, marketing and business purposes. In compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction, as a participant you may have the opportunity to opt-out of any communications that are not related to awarding prizes.\n\t•\tLocation Information. Based on your interaction with the Services, the type of device you use to access the Services, and your device’s connectivity, we may collect location-based information including your Internet protocol (IP) address, GPS location, longitude/latitude, city, county, zip code and region, and your location and your smart device’s proximity to “beacons,” Bluetooth networks and/or other proximity systems. We may use this type of information to enhance your user experience (such as using location information for the purposes of displaying the geographic distribution of Peloton workouts on a heat map), to better understand your interaction with our products and services in our showrooms, or to enable you to track your outdoor fitness activities. Unless you provide us with your consent to do otherwise, this information will only be used by us and our third party service providers to provide you with the Services you request or in an aggregated and anonymized format that does not identify you. If you no longer wish to have this location information collected and used by us, you may opt-out by disabling the location and Bluetooth features in the operating system of your device.\n\t•\tAutomatic Data Collection. We may collect certain information automatically through our Services or other methods of web analysis, such as your IP address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising identifiers, MAC address, IMEI, Advertiser ID, and other device identifiers that are automatically assigned to your computer or device when you access the Internet, browser type and language, geo-location information, hardware type, operating system, Internet service provider, pages that you visit before and after using the Services, the date and time of your visit, the amount of time you spend on each page, information about the links you click and pages you view within the Services, and other actions taken through use of the Services such as preferences.

For example, if you access our Services through a third party application, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play App Store (together with any similar applications, “App Stores”) or social media sites such as Facebook, we may collect information about you from that third party application that you have made public via your privacy settings.

It wasn’t good. It’s now amazing. I use Chromecast to take it with me on the road and in my condo’s gym. Great, great workouts. \n\nOld review:\nI guess the utility of the app depends upon your goals. If your goal is heart rate training (HRT), or some sort of high intensity fitness training, there are better videos on You Tube. If your goal is to pass the time with a certain type of music, and get \"life coaching\" from a yoga teacher, then this app will work for you. I found Steve Little to be the best, most serious instructor. I found Nicole Meline to be one I wanted to mute as she offered empty platitudes like \"make yourself essential\", \"paint a new masterpiece today\", \"you don't have to accept that inheritance\". Huh? I'm looking to work hard and get my heart rate up to 90-93% That isn't a goal of this program. Apparently, helping the depressed is. What they need to do to cater to serious fitness folks: get some graphics on the screen: heart rate as a percent of maximum; cadence; resistance,; effort level; segment time; total time. Instead, you're gonna get \"favorite playlists\". That's fine for the Lululemon yoga pants in the grocery store \"athlete\", but how about something for the serious folks? They clearly have the technology. For me, it's back to You Tube videos.  I'll check back in six months. Maybe they'll come around.","title":"Vast improvement from original app","userName":"loanflyer"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6010293097","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-05-29T18:27:18Z","rating":5,"review":"I have been a Peloton bike user (in my building gym) for a year and a half.  I was doing workouts 5 days/wk. When the COVID-19 crisis started unfolding. As many things started changing the directive to close gyms came to fruition \u0026 my building complied and closed our gym facilities. \nI knew I’d be able to “deal” with the changes put into place however, one thing that really annoyed me was that I’d have to stop my 5 day a week habit that I have painstakinly made part of my daily week day regimen.  I did not want to break this habit. \nThis is where this app came in!  Peloton brilliantly extended a 90 day trial for their app. I am hooked!  I plan on keeping my membership and plan to incorporate it into my routine. I have been able to keep up with workouts from the same people who I have grown to love and more.  While, its not the cycling part I was able to seamelssly continue a workout routine.  Once things start to reopen I will go back to cycling but I definitely will want the other workouts that were not currenty part of using the gym bike. \nI love the variety of workouts, instrutors, playlists...one thing I would love to see is an ability to create a workout “playlist”. Sometimes I want to exercise for 60 minutes total and  I like to do 2 30 minute workouts. I would love the ability to select the 2 workouts and have them play in selected order.","title":"Love this app!","userName":"URMomFromCollege"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3351716281","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-10-28T00:23:47Z","rating":5,"review":"Been using the app for workouts for the last 4 months and I am obsessed with it. Am particularly keen on the treadmill workouts - I love running outdoors but it’s not always practical and boy does this app take away from the monotony of treadmill running. It even spurred me on to my faster 5k, 10k and 1 mile distances for the last 3 years in the short time I have been using it. I love the ranges provided so you can measure profession by taking the same class, the instructors are inspiring, the user experience is sleek and uncomplicated. I too would love to be able to interact with my contacts a bit more (get notifications of them finishing workouts etc.) and see if they signed up for the same live classes - there is a sense of community already but I think it could be built on. As an app user, I’d love the ability to rate the workouts after I complete them to more easily return to the ones I enjoyed most. Personally a bit more information on the run itself would be useful I.e 4 min work up, followed by 3 min sprint intervals followed by 3 mins hill intervals etc. But these are minor points - I have already converted 5+ friends to the app and am thinking of getting the treadmill itself because I love the whole idea so much! #teampeloton","title":"Subscription fitness at its best!","userName":"Minter81"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4488301234","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-07-20T00:51:48Z","rating":5,"review":"My orthopedic surgeon told me I was a classic exercise addict when I was sitting in his office a few years ago for my 3rd knee surgery in as many years. I was a mixed martial artist, a CrossFitter and an all around glutton for punishment when it came to the way I treated my body.\nIf it didn’t hurt, I wasn’t interested. My husband told me to look at Peloton but I was never interested in cycling because it didn’t seem intense enough. Well... after much coaxing, I bought a Peloton and I freaking loved it from the minute I started. Totally surprised myself. The other thing I didn’t count on was the community. Similar to what I was used to in CrossFit and in fighting. Peloton has built a wonderful platform that everyone feels welcome. I also didn’t count on the amazing content that this app has. It’s not just about the bike or the tread. It’s about workouts I can do when I travel for work. Everything from strength workouts to outdoor running to yoga and meditation. It’s worth every penny. And the instructors... I realize none of them know me, but they are a big part of my life. They are knowledgeable and vulnerable and real and inspiring on so many levels.

While I appreciate that they warn you if the video is explicit it doesn’t help when they’re almost ALL explicit with no way to filter out the bad language. I’d like the instructors to buy a thesaurus and use cleaner language. Never heard so much swearing by instructors in any fitness app I’ve tried. It’s the only reason I probably won’t be purchasing after free trial ends. The video editors could bleep out some of the bad words but don’t seem to care. If you have kids then les mills tv app is superior. They too offer cycling workout videos. The peloton workouts are good but I have to watch them on silent with subtitles when my young child is awake and play my own music. The frequent swearing ruins this otherwise great app. My other gripe is the lack of a pause button. Les mills has it so why not add it to peloton videos? All our kids are home due to the pandemic and not being able to pause it when they enter the room is a huge problem. These are not family friendly workouts which is too bad since son no longer gets PE in school. If you’d remove all the swearing kids could use them for home PE purposes with us.

I am absolutely obsessed with my Peloton and look forward to my rides every day. I have a couple suggestions for the app and experience. First, I like to plan out my next ride on the app when I’m commuting or in between meetings. (I always do on demand rides because of my work schedule). I really really need to see the playlist on the app because music is an important part of a ride. Second, I’d also like to see my achievement badges on the app. Third, it would be great to see side by side comparisons of output/cadence/resistance with connections who have completed the same ride. Fourth, it would be interesting to think about sending push notifications when your connections finish a ride - I love giving my friends kudos when they complete rings on the Apple Watch. This totally helps build community.  Finally, I’d really like functionality to be able to search for theme rides (ie Madonna, Lady Gaga etc). They’re a pain to search for now because you have to rely on comments on the Facebook page and then search for a specific date and instructor.  I am a HUGE fan of the Peloton and am offering these suggestions to make the experience even more life changing. Thanks!","title":"More functionality needed on App","userName":"Dan SF"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4584711437","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-08-08T05:19:14Z","rating":5,"review":"Wow! I am enamored with this app. The classes are quick, Engaging  and have immediate results. I’ve never been a big gym rat and prefer to be outside during all seasons. I have been running fun runs with peloton and I’m excited every day to get out and meet a new instructor and even hear different music. Every class I have taken the instructors are precise in body positioning which prevents injuries and also makes what you are trying to do easier and of course Beneficial. It is so easy to come out of form and then often the exercise you are working so hard to do is loosing its power !  So far I have found  wonderfully inspiring teachers who you know are one hundred percent genuine and legit in their own personal lives. I have been into fitness for many years but this is different than anything I’ve done , it is encouraging, tough but gentle and spot on accurate when targeting areas of the body to tone and strengthen. \nI’m so excited to be part of the peloton family. My abs have never looked and FELT so good ! Being able to be anywhere and do a ten minute or hour long class leave you with no excuses ! \nShine on peloton....

I had belonged to an expensive gym, and the only classes I really wanted to go to were the spin classes, but I hated going to spin class. Trying to get there on time to get a bike, and dealing with a room full of smelly people, me included, plus not always understanding what the instructor was saying made me not like it so much. I quit the gym, bought a spin type bike, with attachments for my iPad, cadence monitor, heart rate monitor, spd clip pedals, and I haven't stopped getting on the bike. The instructors are great. I figured out which ones suit me best after a few months, the music is great, and I can hear and understand the instructions perfectly. I have a little table next to my bike to keep my hand weights and extra water. I love this so much. I've lost fat and have developed muscle tone. There's been a recent update where I can attach my cadence and heart rate monitors to the Peloton app which is fantastic. Thank you for that. Some day, I'll be able to get the actual bike, until then, this works perfectly for me.","title":"Best thing I've done for myself in a long time","userName":"QR scanerless"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6253312029","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-28T23:56:58Z","rating":3,"review":"I’ve had my Peloton bike for a little over a month now and it’s definitely changed my relationship with working out and it’s something I genuinely look forward to using. Plus the Peloton platform has tons of different types of workouts (strength, yoga, boot camp, walking/running, etc) you can follow to get some variety into your exercise routine. The iPhone and iPad apps make it easy to take advantage to the huge library of workout content available on the platform both live and on demand. The Apple TV app on the other hand is lacking some significant features that make it much, much less useful. First off you cannot join live classes on the Apple TV app not can you even see the schedule, second you cannot see any of the collections or recommended programs they’ve curated which are numerous and very well through out, and finally you can’t see anything having to do with your profile and workout history. It’s lacking a good 40+% of the functions the other apps include. You can basically only see the on demand classes for each category and filter from there. I hope a significant update is planned to bring it in line as it’s easier now to just AirPlay from your iPhone or iPad.

Warning - If you get this app to use while you are waiting for delivery of your bike/tread, beware to cancel your trial subscription when you start your full subscription at delivery/installation time. Even though my family members linked their App to our bike membership before the end of the trial period, Peloton continued to collect money from us for multiple individual subscriptions. This is managed through the Apple or Google pay systems - search for “How to Cancel a Peloton digital membership” on Peloton support site. Peloton denies all responsibility for the duplicate subscription and forces you to talk with Apple/Google to resolve this. They do not care about your satisfaction or inconvenience even though they develop the Apps and so control the membership behaviors, and must receive a significant fraction of the collected funds. I spoke with several Peloton support people and while pleasant, they showed zero flexibility to help a customer and were very firm in just stonewalling people who have paid a lot of $$ for their equipment and content.\n\nI am much less satisfied as a customer because of this small glitch - entirely because Peloton is handling this so callously.\n\nI am sure that some class action lawyers will make solid $ from bringing suit to correct this lousy App behavior and Peloton’s abandonment of their customers.","title":"Duplicate Subscription fraud","userName":"Jnschin"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"903062499","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"1 month of unlimited access to live-streaming and on-demand Peloton classes on your iPad.
