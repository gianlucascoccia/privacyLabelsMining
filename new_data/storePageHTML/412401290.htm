Available at $6.99 for a 12 month subscription, the IAFF Pro-Calendar app is an even better value at over 50% off compared to our calendar/organizers.  For less than half the price you get twice the value of our paper product!  \n \nDESCRIPTION:\nThe IAFF Pro-Calendar is a powerful software program developed for the iPhone and specifically designed to program unique fire fighter color-coded shift schedules and track various work related activities important to today’s Fire Fighter. \n\nPlease note that this is a somewhat complex app, and may take some time to learn. We have created many tutorials (www.pro-calendar.com/iphone/tutorials.html) for all of the features as well as included an area to email us in the help section. Please do not hesitate to ask us for help.\n\nFEATURES:\nTrack Real Time Balances: \n•Shift trades \n•Sick time \n•Comp time \n•Overtime \n•Vacation time \n•Training \n\nCalendar Specific Features: \n•Custom to your color-coded shift schedule \n•Add Kelly and Debit day cycles \n•Payday cycles \n•Set reoccurring appointments with individual alarms \n\nExposure - Incident Logs: \n•Medical \n•Fire \n•Haz Mat \n•Other incidents \nQuickly record vital information related to exposures--a critical component when dealing with presumptive disease documentation. \n\nHighlighted Features Include: \n•Alarm mode reminders for important appointments, meetings and dates \n•Automatic adjustments of accrual rates for sick time and vacation hours tied to your specific pay periods \n\nThe IAFF Foundation is comprised of the following: \n\n•IAFF Burn Foundation \n•Disaster Relief Fund \n•Fallen Fire Fighter Memorial Foundation \n•John P. Redmond Foundation \n•McClellan Scholarship Fund\n\nThe IAFF Pro-Calendar is free to download and use for 30-days. After that trial period you must purchase a subscription to continue using the calendar. \n\nA yearly auto-renewing subscription is $6.99. \n\nPayment will be charged to an iTunes Account. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription. A subscription automatically renews at the end of the listed yearly price unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the current period ends.

For less than half the price you get twice the value of our paper product!  <br /> <br />DESCRIPTION:<br />The IAFF Pro-Calendar is a powerful software program developed for the iPhone and specifically designed to program unique fire fighter color-coded shift schedules and track various work related activities important to today’s Fire Fighter. <br /><br />Please note that this is a somewhat complex app, and may take some time to learn. We have created many tutorials (www.pro-calendar.com/iphone/tutorials.html) for all of the features as well as included an area to email us in the help section. Please do not hesitate to ask us for help.<br /><br />FEATURES:<br />Track Real Time Balances: <br />•Shift trades <br />•Sick time <br />•Comp time <br />•Overtime <br />•Vacation time <br />•Training <br /><br />Calendar Specific Features: <br />•Custom to your color-coded shift schedule <br />•Add Kelly and Debit day cycles <br />•Payday cycles <br />•Set reoccurring appointments with individual alarms <br /><br />Exposure - Incident Logs: <br />•Medical <br />•Fire <br />•Haz Mat <br />•Other incidents <br />Quickly record vital information related to exposures--a critical component when dealing with presumptive disease documentation. <br /><br />Highlighted Features Include: <br />•Alarm mode reminders for important appointments, meetings and dates <br />•Automatic adjustments of accrual rates for sick time and vacation hours tied to your specific pay periods <br /><br />The IAFF Foundation is comprised of the following: <br /><br />•IAFF Burn Foundation <br />•Disaster Relief Fund <br />•Fallen Fire Fighter Memorial Foundation <br />•John P. Redmond Foundation <br />•McClellan Scholarship Fund<br /><br />The IAFF Pro-Calendar is free to download and use for 30-days. After that trial period you must purchase a subscription to continue using the calendar. <br /><br />A yearly auto-renewing subscription is $6.99. <br /><br />Payment will be charged to an iTunes Account. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription. A subscription automatically renews at the end of the listed yearly price unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the current period ends. A subscription can be managed in Account Settings after purchase.<br /> <br />Pro-Calendar® Privacy Policy may be found at: http://www.pro-calendar.com/privacy.html<br /> <br /> Pro-Calendar® Terms of Use may be found at: http://www.pro-calendar.com/terms.html<br /> <br />Contact Us: Support@Pro-Calendar.com<br /><br />We appreciate your continued support and plan to support this app fully.

However there are a couple issues. <br />It would be nice if you would get a renewal notice a couple of weeks or even a couple of days before you expired. <br />Contact with support could also be improved.I never got a reply the last time I contacted them but my account seems to be reset so that is nice.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>First off, it was a good app when it worked.  Now it repeatedly asks for my credit card info, and has lost all my events/OT/training/education.  Now it’s absolutely garbage.   I just want my calendar and events back.  I paid full for a year and now I’m not getting what I paid for.  This app is a joke.  <br /><br /> Please don’t waste your money.  I cannot believe the IAFF allows this company to use its affiliation.....the developers of this site should be aware of how much the calendar is non functional and an absolute ripoff and has many unhappy customers.   Come on open your eyes!!  Do the right thing and refund our money......Just read the reviews, they basically all complain of similar malfunctions so it’s certainly not an isolated thing that’s just happened to me.  <br /><br />Don’t waste your time or money on this....save yourself the aggravation.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Please save your money!!! Anyone that rates this app more then 2 stars either works for the Procalendar people or knows someone that does.  App has way to many bugs to be out yet and crashes all the time.  If it worked this would be a fantastic application, but it doesn&#39;t and its not.  I promise there will be a lot more &quot;1 star&quot; reviews to come.  Again! Please save your money. Updates won&#39;t come fast enough to fix all the issues. To the Procalendar people I can&#39;t believe that the IAFF is letting you put their name on this product. Take down the app and start over, it&#39;s a great idea and would be fantastic! It just doesn&#39;t work.  I&#39;m not Nostradamus or have a crystal ball, but watch for the other poor ratings; they&#39;re coming!!! Another thing I noticed is that the reviews keep getting reset in the App store...I wonder why that is????</p>

If you come across any problems you can email us at support@pro-calendar.com\n\nPrevious Update:\nPro-Calendar is pleased to announce the release of part 1 of our 3 part iOS 7 update! We are taking the opportunity with iOS 7 to completely revamp and improve upon our app. Since we are completely changing many areas of the app, we have broken the update into 3 parts. The reasoning behind this is to get this new experience into the hands of users faster, as well as make sure we don’t break anything in the process. This update will not only bring the look of our app up to the new iOS standard, but increase functionality and usability for our users. Below is a look at what has been updated in part 1, as well as what’s to come in parts 2 and 3.\n\nPART 1: The first phase of our update brings the overall look of the app in line with iOS 7’s visual style. We’ve also updated our event creation screens, making it easier than ever to add events. Not only do the add events screens look better, but we’ve also made some improvements under the hood. We have also made improvements to the calendar settings and list view area.\n\nPARTS 2 (COMING SOON): The second phase of our update will focus on user accounts, adding features like ability to have your password sent to you if forgotten. We will also be adding the ability for users to back up their calendar to our servers. Not only will this protect your data in the event you lose your phone, but will also allow you to copy information from one device to the other. \n\nPART 3 (COMING EARLY 2014): The final phase of our iOS 7 update, we will be focusing on improvements to the organizer section of the app. This will include a more streamlined view when looking at events, as well as additional details for events like Overtime. On top of that we will also be adding in some advanced settings to allow even more customization in the way your events are tracked.  Last but not least, trades will be receiving an overhaul to make them easier to create and track. \n\nThroughout each part of our iOS 7 update, we will be making other various optimizations and bug fixes. As always we thank all of our user's for their support as we continue to try and make our app the best out there. Please don't hesitate to send us your feedback at contact@pro-calendar\n\n*NOTE: The app has been optimized for use on iOS 7","releaseDate":"2013-12-19"},{"versionDisplay":"3.0","releaseNotes":"Pro-Calendar is pleased to announce the release of part 1 of our 3 part iOS 7 update!

We have also added 2 of our most requested features, custom events and repeats for all events. Read below for information on these new features and look to our website, www.pro-calendar.com/iphone for video tutorials in the near future. Thanks again for all of your support over these last 2 years and into the future as we still have big plans for the app in 2013! \n\nNEW FEATURES \n\nCustom Events: Our most requested feature is finally coming to the IAFF Pro-Calendar, Custom Events! You can now create your own custom categories for the calendar and the organizer. With these custom categories you can pick a name and a symbol to use for marking the calendar, as well as select a method of tracking. There are 3 main event types that over different level of stat tracking: \n\n- NONE: This event type is mainly used for creating events for the calendar that you use a lot, such as union meetings, kid’s games, etc. This event type will not keep track of any stats, and it used mainly for marking the calendar, similar to appointments. \n\n- LOG: This event type will create a section in the organizer and track entries made, similar to overtime. In the organizer section you can see dates and hours, with a monthly total, however you cannot use or deduct these hours. Use this event type to track things like run time, exercise or holiday overtime. \n\n- HOURS: The hours event type will create a section in the organizer that tracks your hours earned and used, similar to vacation and sick time. This is useful for tracking balances of Personal Time, Holiday Time, etc. \n\n**Currently you can create 3 custom events per category, this is to limit the app from taking up too much memory on your phone. \n\nOrganizer Settings: You will see there is now a settings button in the organizer section. Here you can create new event types as well as turn the default events off. Now you can hide sections you don’t use without losing the data. \n\n“Mark on Calendar” Repeats: When creating any event type you will now see the option to repeat that created event, as oppose to only appointments having this feature previously. In addition, we have added a new method for repeating events called, “Mark on Calendar.” When you choose this option you will be taken to the calendar where you can tap every day you want to repeat this event. This is very useful for things like vacation picks, where you can make 1 entry and mark all your vacation days at once. Once created, each event can be edited independently of the others.","releaseDate":"2013-09-18"},{"versionDisplay":"2.1","releaseNotes":"2.1 \n\n-Fixed a bug with the calendar not showing past subscription date\n-Fixed a bug where overtime and comp time entries were switched\n-Fixed several crashes related to viewing and editing events\n\nPrevious 2.0 Update:\n\nOur biggest update yet, the IAFF Pro-Calendar version 2.0 marks our 2nd anniversary and brings an updated look with all new graphics!

If you have a second please leave us a review on iTunes, as it really helps us out. We have many plans for this app in the future, so stay tuned for further updates.\n\nNEW FEATURES:\n\n• Holidays: Now you can track holidays and major observances for the US, Canada and Australia. Located under the calendar setting, you can toggle which holidays you want to display. When toggled on, the holidays will show up under the calendar when that day is selected, and in the list view. You can toggle whether or not you want them highlighted on the calendar, which will mark the days with a red box similar to pay days. \n\n• Create Holidays: You can also create your own holidays to be added to the list. This is a great feature to mark birthdays, anniversaries, special observances, etc. On the holiday tab, hit the “+” to add a new holiday to the list. You can also delete created holidays with a simple right to left swipe in the holiday list.\n\n• Built in RSS Feeds: You can now read posts from the IAFF Breaking News and IAFF Frontline Blog within the app! Simply hit the more tab on the bottom bar to start reading.\n\n• Jump to Date Button: We have added a “Jump To” button on the main calendar that allows you to quickly view a month without having to scroll through the entire year. Simply hit the “Jump To” button in the upper right hand corner, pick a month and year if necessary and hit Jump To. If you want to return to the current month, hit the “Jump To” button again and the current month is already loaded. We have removed the add event button from the calendar tab but you can still tap and hold on a date on the calendar to quickly add events with that date already pre-filled. \n\n• Extended Shift Cycles: Now shift cycles can be entered up to 50 days, instead of the previous limit of 30. This should now accommodate almost every shift rotation.\n\nFIXES:\n\n- Fixed several bugs that were causing the app to crash after creating events.\n- Updated some icons that were not optimized for Retina Display\n","releaseDate":"2012-03-09"}],"hasPrivacyPolicyText":false,"supportedLocales":[{"name":"English","tag":"en-US"}],"customAttributes":{"default":{"default":{"customScreenshotsByType":{"iphone":[{"width":640,"height":960,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/e2/67/09/e267092f-e421-5a05-d20f-b3eac89329c3/mzl.znyuzaod.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f0eeef","textColor1":"140101","textColor2":"111111","textColor3":"403131","textColor4":"3e3d3d"},{"width":640,"height":960,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/b8/17/8f/b8178ffa-5e73-6011-a499-89a358424e98/mzl.eaqmccxn.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f0eeef","textColor1":"161616","textColor2":"650808","textColor3":"414141","textColor4":"813637"},{"width":640,"height":960,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/ed/a8/c7/eda8c7be-db68-b98b-4231-b1bd61ee63e7/mzl.oydzooqd.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f0eeef","textColor1":"171717","textColor2":"262626","textColor3":"424242","textColor4":"4e4e4e"},{"width":640,"height":960,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/b2/7e/dc/b27edc95-7f09-1137-f631-20fdb73ec852/mzl.jlzvjlyk.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f0eeef","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"1a1a1a","textColor3":"302f2f","textColor4":"454445"},{"width":640,"height":960,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/c3/cc/0e/c3cc0ebb-67f3-0ebe-bcfa-7ab6334af0ad/mzl.hljwjrfn.jpg/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f0eeef","textColor1":"1e1e1e","textColor2":"08203f","textColor3":"484848","textColor4":"364962"}],"iphone6":[{"width":750,"height":1334,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/e6/d8/28/e6d82834-8b47-9dbb-a7f1-cffe31e88bbc/40fd4203-b492-4f28-b775-12fb4eed2f3b_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_-_2020-07-19_at_14.52.52.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"660909","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"843a3a"},{"width":750,"height":1334,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/45/4b/d7/454bd7d4-ead0-d974-db20-4cef280c0072/9d8336c5-cf7e-43ac-942f-a6e406369e69_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_-_2020-07-19_at_14.53.04.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"660909","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"843a3a"},{"width":750,"height":1334,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/7f/72/25/7f7225e5-1dda-d6a0-1f01-373903631b39/fc70ac5e-7d59-467d-8c79-5996a12d3512_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_-_2020-07-19_at_14.53.09.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"660909","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"843a3a"},{"width":750,"height":1334,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/6d/3d/ad/6d3dad7c-7de8-a1b0-9eeb-392f98b825c4/63464c06-6035-4516-8c71-ba202c95d428_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_-_2020-07-19_at_14.53.00.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"171717","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"454545"},{"width":750,"height":1334,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/29/a2/24/29a2245a-fd8f-0979-7dc7-fa9b25b6d5f4/551fe0af-440b-4179-9742-6f315f54d292_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_8_-_2020-07-19_at_15.00.23.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f7f7f7","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"660909","textColor3":"313131","textColor4":"833838"}],"iphone_6_5":[{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/7d/76/5e/7d765e9f-1ec4-d12e-be7d-c9abffb7b68b/66140784-6101-4ad0-baaf-4924fe5c4e66_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_-_2020-07-19_at_14.43.43.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"660909","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"843a3a"},{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/cc/f6/62/ccf662d4-13ca-df4c-8a82-11e8a25bda78/b8cd44ab-0394-4ea0-bc25-b09d67471c46_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_-_2020-07-19_at_14.44.43.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"2a2a2a","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"555555"},{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/27/02/dd/2702dd5c-3edc-2189-024c-eaa1c7eb3b4b/dfd4715e-34dc-4994-adbc-c594a43add9f_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_-_2020-07-16_at_01.40.11.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"660909","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"843a3a"},{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/ab/44/d0/ab44d0f0-6631-7627-92ae-88ff20eff420/5a0e4f1e-689a-4f6e-93d9-8e32ed9b0073_Simulator_Screen_Shot_-_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_-_2020-07-16_at_01.40.33.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"1d1d1d","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"4a4a4a"},{"width":1242,"height":2688,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4

We have actually resorted to using a standard paper calendar hung up on the fridge and just writing shifts out on the dates. This app asks you to renew and verify your subscription at least every six months to a tune of roughly $7.00. The app constantly crashes and is not easy to navigate.

We are taking the opportunity with iOS 7 to completely revamp and improve upon our app. Since we are completely changing many areas of the app, we have broken the update into 3 parts. The reasoning behind this is to get this new experience into the hands of users faster, as well as make sure we don’t break anything in the process. This update will not only bring the look of our app up to the new iOS standard, but increase functionality and usability for our users. Below is a look at what has been updated in part 1, as well as what’s to come in parts 2 and 3.\n\nPART 1: The first phase of our update brings the overall look of the app in line with iOS 7’s visual style. We’ve also updated our event creation screens, making it easier than ever to add events. Not only do the add events screens look better, but we’ve also made some improvements under the hood. We have also made improvements to the calendar settings and list view area.\n\nPARTS 2 (COMING SOON): The second phase of our update will focus on user accounts, adding features like ability to have your password sent to you if forgotten. We will also be adding the ability for users to back up their calendar to our servers. Not only will this protect your data in the event you lose your phone, but will also allow you to copy information from one device to the other. \n\nPART 3 (COMING EARLY 2014): The final phase of our iOS 7 update, we will be focusing on improvements to the organizer section of the app. This will include a more streamlined view when looking at events, as well as additional details for events like Overtime. On top of that we will also be adding in some advanced settings to allow even more customization in the way your events are tracked.  Last but not least, trades will be receiving an overhaul to make them easier to create and track. \n\nThroughout each part of our iOS 7 update, we will be making other various optimizations and bug fixes. As always we thank all of our user's for their support as we continue to try and make our app the best out there. Please don't hesitate to send us your feedback at contact@pro-calendar\n\n*NOTE: The app has been optimized for use on iOS 7","releaseDate":"2013-12-19"},{"versionDisplay":"3.0","releaseNotes":"Pro-Calendar is pleased to announce the release of part 1 of our 3 part iOS 7 update!

We have also added 2 of our most requested features, custom events and repeats for all events. Read below for information on these new features and look to our website, www.pro-calendar.com/iphone for video tutorials in the near future. Thanks again for all of your support over these last 2 years and into the future as we still have big plans for the app in 2013! \n\nNEW FEATURES \n\nCustom Events: Our most requested feature is finally coming to the IAFF Pro-Calendar, Custom Events! You can now create your own custom categories for the calendar and the organizer. With these custom categories you can pick a name and a symbol to use for marking the calendar, as well as select a method of tracking. There are 3 main event types that over different level of stat tracking: \n\n- NONE: This event type is mainly used for creating events for the calendar that you use a lot, such as union meetings, kid’s games, etc. This event type will not keep track of any stats, and it used mainly for marking the calendar, similar to appointments. \n\n- LOG: This event type will create a section in the organizer and track entries made, similar to overtime. In the organizer section you can see dates and hours, with a monthly total, however you cannot use or deduct these hours. Use this event type to track things like run time, exercise or holiday overtime. \n\n- HOURS: The hours event type will create a section in the organizer that tracks your hours earned and used, similar to vacation and sick time. This is useful for tracking balances of Personal Time, Holiday Time, etc. \n\n**Currently you can create 3 custom events per category, this is to limit the app from taking up too much memory on your phone. \n\nOrganizer Settings: You will see there is now a settings button in the organizer section. Here you can create new event types as well as turn the default events off. Now you can hide sections you don’t use without losing the data. \n\n“Mark on Calendar” Repeats: When creating any event type you will now see the option to repeat that created event, as oppose to only appointments having this feature previously. In addition, we have added a new method for repeating events called, “Mark on Calendar.” When you choose this option you will be taken to the calendar where you can tap every day you want to repeat this event. This is very useful for things like vacation picks, where you can make 1 entry and mark all your vacation days at once. Once created, each event can be edited independently of the others.","releaseDate":"2013-09-18"},{"versionDisplay":"2.1","releaseNotes":"2.1 \n\n-Fixed a bug with the calendar not showing past subscription date\n-Fixed a bug where overtime and comp time entries were switched\n-Fixed several crashes related to viewing and editing events\n\nPrevious 2.0 Update:\n\nOur biggest update yet, the IAFF Pro-Calendar version 2.0 marks our 2nd anniversary and brings an updated look with all new graphics!

If you have a second please leave us a review on iTunes, as it really helps us out. We have many plans for this app in the future, so stay tuned for further updates.\n\nNEW FEATURES:\n\n• Holidays: Now you can track holidays and major observances for the US, Canada and Australia. Located under the calendar setting, you can toggle which holidays you want to display. When toggled on, the holidays will show up under the calendar when that day is selected, and in the list view. You can toggle whether or not you want them highlighted on the calendar, which will mark the days with a red box similar to pay days. \n\n• Create Holidays: You can also create your own holidays to be added to the list. This is a great feature to mark birthdays, anniversaries, special observances, etc. On the holiday tab, hit the “+” to add a new holiday to the list. You can also delete created holidays with a simple right to left swipe in the holiday list.\n\n• Built in RSS Feeds: You can now read posts from the IAFF Breaking News and IAFF Frontline Blog within the app! Simply hit the more tab on the bottom bar to start reading.\n\n• Jump to Date Button: We have added a “Jump To” button on the main calendar that allows you to quickly view a month without having to scroll through the entire year. Simply hit the “Jump To” button in the upper right hand corner, pick a month and year if necessary and hit Jump To. If you want to return to the current month, hit the “Jump To” button again and the current month is already loaded. We have removed the add event button from the calendar tab but you can still tap and hold on a date on the calendar to quickly add events with that date already pre-filled. \n\n• Extended Shift Cycles: Now shift cycles can be entered up to 50 days, instead of the previous limit of 30. This should now accommodate almost every shift rotation.\n\nFIXES:\n\n- Fixed several bugs that were causing the app to crash after creating events.\n- Updated some icons that were not optimized for Retina Display\n","releaseDate":"2012-03-09"}],"languageList":["English"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"privacyPolicyUrl":"http://www.pro-calendar.com/privacy.html","requirementsString":"Requires iOS 12.0 or later.
