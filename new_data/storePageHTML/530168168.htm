    Crashes, loses spot, makes you watch unnecessary commercials

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>If I could give this app 0 stars, I would. When I use this app with Chromecast, it constantly crashes and not only does the app crash, it causes my Chromecast to crash as well. Then when everything comes back up, it doesn’t start your show at the same spot AND makes you watch commercials before it even starts at the wrong spot, then chances are you’re gonna have to fast forward thru a scheduled commercial break and then you’re gonna have to wait for those as well. It’s ridiculous. Such a horrible bug needs to be fixed and be fixed NOW. <br /><br />Then there’s the horrible lack of certain content. If people are paying for this service, ALL of the CBS library should be available. I imagine a lot of people want a CBS service so they can watch shows like The Big Bang Theory. Welp. Sorry. YOU ONLY GET 5 EPISODES. Are you kidding me? One of their most popular shows and you can only watch the last 5 episodes?? Do your fans a favor and give them the content they want instead of asking for more money on top of the money you already ask for the streaming service. Horrible.</p>

    Crashing App
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I was really excited to have this app when I first got paramount plus several months ago on my phone as it would give me a chance to watch movies and shows when I’m doing work without have to turn on my laptop to watch or plug my laptop into my TV with an HDMI cable if I wasn’t using the main TV that was logged into paramount plus. However, in the last 3 to 4 months, this app has done nothing but crash. I have done everything I can think of from updating the app when it needs to be updated, uninstalling it and reinstalling it, and turning my phone on and off. I have tried looking up solutions on the Internet, but they either weren’t very helpful or I wasn’t able to perform the solutions that other people have said might work. With all of the fixes that have been going on in the updates provided, the one thing that has not been fixedIs the crashing of the app on an iPhone. I can’t watch anything without the app crashing two seconds into a TV show or a movie. I then have to constantly re-open the app and find out where I left off in a TV show or movie because it doesn’t restart where I left off. Oh no it starts me from the very beginning and I have to find out where I left off. With all of the updates that are being done I hope that you take a look at the app crashing because that is the biggest issue I have with this and itd be nice to be able to watch something on my phone without it crashing on me every two seconds.</p>

    Live TV segments issues, can’t save shows, doesn’t remember where left off
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’m currently doing the commercial plan free preview. I will cancel very soon for three specific reasons.  1.) Going to live TV and selecting one of the segments glitch — Every single time a black screen flashes and it repeats the last 10 seconds before continuing to the next segment.  This makes watching previous live TV segments unwatchable.  2.) The app does not remember where I left off, which means I have to start from the beginning of an episode upon coming back to the app. I’m lucky if I remember where I was, so this is another frustrating dealbreaker.  3.) There are a ton of shows, and some of them you can download, which are the only reasons I’ve ranked this two stars.  Problem is, I have to scroll through hundreds of shows every time I want to see what I want to watch, because there is no way to “pin”, or otherwise mark a show as something I want to watch later. It is perplexing that there is no “list” or way to save a show to watch later. You really expect me to scroll for five whole minutes to try to find/remember the show that I wanted to watch last week?  Biggest dealbreaker - I almost don’t even want to use for free without this feature. Lastly, there is a section called “Keep Watching”, but the shows don’t end up there if you don’t watch enough of them, so quickly opening a show to get it to save there as a hack doesn’t work.</p>

However, in the last 3 to 4 months, this app has done nothing but crash. I have done everything I can think of from updating the app when it needs to be updated, uninstalling it and reinstalling it, and turning my phone on and off. I have tried looking up solutions on the Internet, but they either weren’t very helpful or I wasn’t able to perform the solutions that other people have said might work. With all of the fixes that have been going on in the updates provided, the one thing that has not been fixedIs the crashing of the app on an iPhone. I can’t watch anything without the app crashing two seconds into a TV show or a movie. I then have to constantly re-open the app and find out where I left off in a TV show or movie because it doesn’t restart where I left off. Oh no it starts me from the very beginning and I have to find out where I left off. With all of the updates that are being done I hope that you take a look at the app crashing because that is the biggest issue I have with this and itd be nice to be able to watch something on my phone without it crashing on me every two seconds.","title":"Crashing App","userName":"FamilyTunes4400"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7237352546","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-04-18T19:07:47Z","rating":2,"review":"I’m currently doing the commercial plan free preview. I will cancel very soon for three specific reasons.  1.) Going to live TV and selecting one of the segments glitch — Every single time a black screen flashes and it repeats the last 10 seconds before continuing to the next segment.  This makes watching previous live TV segments unwatchable.  2.) The app does not remember where I left off, which means I have to start from the beginning of an episode upon coming back to the app. I’m lucky if I remember where I was, so this is another frustrating dealbreaker.  3.) There are a ton of shows, and some of them you can download, which are the only reasons I’ve ranked this two stars.  Problem is, I have to scroll through hundreds of shows every time I want to see what I want to watch, because there is no way to “pin”, or otherwise mark a show as something I want to watch later. It is perplexing that there is no “list” or way to save a show to watch later. You really expect me to scroll for five whole minutes to try to find/remember the show that I wanted to watch last week?  Biggest dealbreaker - I almost don’t even want to use for free without this feature. Lastly, there is a section called “Keep Watching”, but the shows don’t end up there if you don’t watch enough of them, so quickly opening a show to get it to save there as a hack doesn’t work.","title":"Live TV segments issues, can’t save shows, doesn’t remember where left off","userName":"thijsdecker"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5231271541","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-12-04T06:50:40Z","developerResponse":{"id":12238817,"body":"Hi!

I’m seriously considering calling my bank for fraudulent activity and having them refund me the money for this app because having to pay for this monstrosity of an app is definitely against the law. I tried this on my Apple TV, my iPhone, my iPad. Just a HORRIBLE app. I feel bad for the TV shows that have to rely on this app for ratings because I genuinely could not spend another minute of my life battling with this app to continue my show. Every 5 seconds the sound goes out. I have to press the 10 second back button to get it to work. Then it will go to a commercial in the middle of one of the most intense scenes and when it comes back it’s 5 minutes ahead of where it left off. Then when I try and rewind, I have to watch the ads again and then when I get back to the part I want to watch, it makes me watch the ads AGAIN. Then still will skip some of the scene again so basically I keep missing key parts of the show- on top of seeing some parts 17 times because I have to keep hitting the rewind button to get sound. I genuinely wish that I could get the time I spent messing around with this app back. For sanity reasons mainly. Hours were wasted and thanks to this app I now probably need therapy.

Yes I did have problems with shows stopping while streaming on the app but that could be internet connection or my phone.\n My problem is that I paid for a commercial free account only to find that now they are going to still play commercials during the show. I tried to watch an older show that was on tv many years ago. I was surprised by the two commercials that popped up. I thought ok maybe they are doing what prime did to us and is showing a quick advertisement before the show. I can live with that. Then half way through the opening credits, it stopped again to show me a couple of commercials. I paid the higher price so I would have more control over what popped up on my computer screen.\nTried to contact the service department and I found I can’t send an email. There are three lines at the bottom that I think are supposed to be drop down menus that I am not able to fill in so can’t send the email. Tried to call to get information on what is going on but the phone just hangs up. I don’t want anything to do with a service that I can’t contact. \nThey don’t even post what shows would qualify for “commercial free.”  Prime at least lets you know if they are going to interrupt your show with commercials. \nWish CBS wouldn’t have changed to Paramount.","title":"Be careful when choosing paramount +","userName":"frustrated with lies"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5386785150","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-01-10T21:30:02Z","developerResponse":{"id":19763507,"body":"Hi!

With multiple devices in the family, it was the TV app for each device/user that kept track of which episode everyone was on, and now that we all have to use the app, and the app doesn’t even have profiles of its own, that tracking is gone, making for a lot of frustration.\n\nThat CBS doesn’t let you turn off the horrendous feature that is auto-play on the Apple TV version just makes things worse if someone falls asleep while watching or just dares to tread too close to the end of an episode.\n\nUltimately, this will force me to either re-sub through the Apple TV app (which will hit CBS financially) or drop my sub. It’s just that frustrating. Plus, just as Netflix’s refusal to support the TV app has led me to dramatically curb my watching of its offerings to the point I may soon cancel my 20-year old sub there, the same would happen with CBS and my commercial-free All Access sub. Without shows showing in Up Next — the starting point for TV for me — I simply forget about shows not listed there, and I rarely get around to checking the apps because I always have something queued up in Up Next.","title":"No longer connects to TV app","userName":"MA fan"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7241835838","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-04-20T01:37:53Z","rating":1,"review":"We can all pretty much agree Netflix is the standard to uphold with streaming platforms. CBS/Paramount is late to the game so why is it that they don’t even have the basic features you expect with streaming services? There are many other streaming platforms that have managed just fine. You literally had a blue print to follow. You know what is expected. How was this released without a “My List” option or “Favorites”? or how about the ability to click the show you were just watching and seeing an episode list option? You can’t do that. You have to search the show again to get to it. \nThe whole point of streaming was to get away from cable and the commercials. This has more commercials than regular tv that you can’t even fast forward through and once you watch a commercial you can’t fast forward/rewind without it taking you back to the same exact commercials you had already sat through. Heaven forbid you forget and have to watch the same 20minutes again plus more commercials. Why are you putting Paramount commercials on here? We already pay you. You have our business. \nYou don’t even have full seasons of your shows. \nMany people have complained about all of the above and nothing has been changed. \nI don’t see how this app was actually approved for release let alone getting complaints for over a year and doing nothing.","title":"Doesn’t Have Basic Features","userName":"🐶🦔"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4181396415","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-05-20T15:11:58Z","developerResponse":{"id":8783728,"body":"Hi!

Now if I had consistent WiFi, then why would I need to download?   It is like the developers have never traveled nor used the other online apps like Prime or Netflix or ITunes.  I paid for it. I should be able to download the episode, with error correction, see the episode and then delete it.  Simple.

However! Because you have to purchase the service to see Picard, and there is no other way, this makes having a terrible service even worse. To create an amazing show, to make it available only if you pay monthly for this service, and then have said service be incredibly slow and glitchy to the point of being practically inoperable is truly a way of showing you care little for your subscribers beyond their money. \n  This is truly the most poorly functioning streaming service I have encountered and I struggle through Prime Tv often. Not only is it incredibly slow, when I watch shows it will get stuck on a commercial loop. It will go to commercial break, go back to the last two seconds before break, then back to a commercial break stopping to try to load for several seconds between each commercial. This will repeat endlessly until I restart completely. At that point, even if I check for updates, turn it of and on again, turn the entire system off and on again, all basic troubleshooting, if you attempt to resume the show it goes strait back into the loop. \n   I am truly frustrated and disappointed and despite my absolute love of all things Picard and Patrick Stewart I will sadly chose to no longer toss money into something that does not work.","title":"Truly Terrible","userName":"bka15"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7592493445","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-07-19T01:57:56Z","rating":2,"review":"I’ve been using this app for years and I used to really enjoy it, but ever since the app changed from CBS All Access to Paramount+, I’ve had constant issues using the live TV feature. I haven’t been able to cast live TV using Chromecast since the name change. Before the name change, the live TV feature worked perfectly with Chromecast. Sometimes live TV doesn’t work at all and I’m unable to watch it, whether or not I try to cast it. This is frustrating, I pay for a monthly subscription, and I expect the service I pay for to work properly. Even if a certain feature of the service is “free”, such as the live TV feature, I still expect it to work. I also have issues with the shows I watch not being saved. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve watched half a show, and then come back to watch the rest the following day, only to find that the show didn’t save in my “keep watching” library. So I’ll then have to find the episode I was watching, and then spend five minutes trying to find where I left off, and I’ll have to watch the ads all over again. I’ll give this app a better rating once the issues I described are fixed, and hopefully that is soon, because my patience and loyalty for corporations and subpar service only go so far.","title":"Consistent issues since the app changed to
