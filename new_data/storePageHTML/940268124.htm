From new musicians looking to get started to experienced producers, Medly has everything you need to unleash your musical spark.\n\nA Best of App Store 2016 winner, Medly’s simple interface is packed with advanced tools to create studio-quality productions. Get started for free with the Starter Pack of 17 instruments and over 100 loops and samples. You can also try Medly Member free for 7 days to unlock over 3000 instruments, loops, and exclusive features.\n\nCREATIVE CONTROL\nMusic-making can be intimidating. Medly makes it easy by breaking songs down into Sections. You can add notes, audio samples, and loops to your Sections, then copy, paste and rearrange them to build your song. At any time, use the History tool to quickly rewind and undo your changes.\n\nA MAGIC TOUCH TO NOTES\nFrom simply adding a note to complex multi-note editing, each interaction was carefully designed with touch in mind. And with over 300 instruments available to Members, you can quickly try out different sounds and find your style.\n\nAMPLIFIED AUDIO\nEdit, snap, and trim your audio clips to your liking. Record or import audio, or use a sample from Medly’s vast audio library. You can record audio up to 4 bars or become a Member and record and import audio up to 30 seconds. As a Member, bring your songs to the next level with professionally recorded vocals by Medly’s talented artists.\n\nPOINT PERFECT AUTOMATION\nAutomatically change volume, echo, and other effects to add fades and pitch bends to your sounds. Snap between points and beats to achieve point perfect precision and use the selection tool to edit multiple automation points together.

At any time, use the History tool to quickly rewind and undo your changes.<br /><br />A MAGIC TOUCH TO NOTES<br />From simply adding a note to complex multi-note editing, each interaction was carefully designed with touch in mind. And with over 300 instruments available to Members, you can quickly try out different sounds and find your style.<br /><br />AMPLIFIED AUDIO<br />Edit, snap, and trim your audio clips to your liking. Record or import audio, or use a sample from Medly’s vast audio library. You can record audio up to 4 bars or become a Member and record and import audio up to 30 seconds. As a Member, bring your songs to the next level with professionally recorded vocals by Medly’s talented artists.<br /><br />POINT PERFECT AUTOMATION<br />Automatically change volume, echo, and other effects to add fades and pitch bends to your sounds. Snap between points and beats to achieve point perfect precision and use the selection tool to edit multiple automation points together. Then open the effect picker to quickly see the automation graphs of all effects within a Section.<br /><br />SHARE AND PLAY<br />Quickly upload your songs to SoundCloud, or share it as a video, audio, MIDI, or Medly file. You can also connect Medly to other apps using Inter-App Audio or play in time using Ableton Link.<br /><br />MADE IN CANADA<br />We’re a small team working relentlessly to make Medly possible.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I do really really really (yes, in Chinese old scholars say that important thing should be told three times) like Medly and already have composed songs even better than my old composition Raining Roof (the improved compositions are Rainy Day, Rendezvous, and Change respectively). However I’d like the price to no longer be free but Member no longer required. You can say the price - $5.99 and even more people just will get past the MONEY barrier and you get profits better than just...before now.<br /><br />Say, do you know my second dream in my mind? I’d like a free, open-source Notes app replacing Medly (and free - but, people do make instruments as a donation.) And I looked at other reviews saying that a gifted teenager could make Medly. Just stop there, you could trust me for new Medly stuff. (Personally, I’d replace the Starter electronic pack with a better Electron, with the Aura (now named Electron) being the lead.) But I’d do the ripping out since my actual status is close to yours, just three years behind. The Notes ... it looks like Apple .... but maybe I would lead in the E-field later on.<br /><br />Oh, and the musics are not just a rip-off of Gallop. Just to make this rating appear as the most relevant of all, so people can get in the Compositionist school. Yes, the Compositionist Axis Rebellion of Music (opponents: Medly, Auxy, MusiQuest). And there are so much parentheses.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Medly is extremely expensive to make and to maintain. We tend to support new devices as soon as they come out, and are relatively quick on supporting essential new features that are released with Apple&#39;s annual updates. Not to mention, we&#39;re still working on new features and release new packs every month. This isn&#39;t a one-time project, that we update every once in a while (where a $5.99 one-time price tag would make sense); this is continuously iterated on product that&#39;s extremely expensive to maintain and develop.<br /><br />And we&#39;re a small company where we don&#39;t have investors - our only source of income is Member. And with Member, we&#39;ve continued to make Medly better and better. There exists open source and/or free music-making apps - but none matches Medly because we dedicate everything behind it.<br /><br />You may see Member as expensive, but the reality is, for $35, you could only purchase 1 or 2 packs from a third party website. With Member at $35/year, you get our access to our existing library and 12 more packs that will be released during your subscription. To put in another perspective, it&#39;s less than a game on a major gaming console.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>my apologies for trying to understand your business, although i still am saying i recommended 2$ not just 75c, i do not understand completely these things since i am a child ( I&#39;m 13). i wont argue the price anymore but i still think you guys were very rude to me and others but my rating is going to be 4 stars still. thank you for responding to my previous reviews and i wish you guys good luck <br /><br />previous response : <br />you see this app is really good, i don&#39;t write reviews unless i have something i really want to say so ill just get to the point. i truly love this app and making music is so easy, but i don&#39;t agree with a subscription. i understand that the app must be expensive to produce and i appreciate that but... i think that you should give us more than one pack, even two would be good? and make the rest of the packs purchaseable for around maybe 75c-2$?? that way people can choose what sounds they want to use without worrying about a charge every month.  some people don&#39;t have the money to pay each month, so i really hope my idea is looked into at least a bit, since personally i am only interested in having a few packs anyways, so if i got the subscription i would be spending a ton of money for things i don&#39;t really need. thank you for your time but i still do really enjoy this app, just not the starter pack being extremely limited and there being a ton of other packs i have to pay each month for.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Sorry to bother I but I like this app but why do we have to pay to use loops I don’t think really like that many people may not like it too sir you created a great app but the only thing that you should only change is being able to get the loops for free to create some great songs many people would like and download this app it’s perfect just change it to the loops being free take that being a member thing there’s also people that don’t have credit cards or money like me but with this app I can make money I can create many great projects for my Tucson rappers please bro just do that one thing for 7 billion people all around the world think how many people with download this if you do if free just like the app music maker jam or garage band their competition if you just take off the member request many rappers and singers or producers will keep installing it that benifits you because you created something very useful why take money for it if it can be useful so your next invention will be liked because of the first application made was so good know people trust your great creations that benifits you well</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I&#39;m sorry you feel this way - but if we made loops, or instruments or (insert request here) free, then there is no reason to become a Member. Without Member, we can&#39;t bring in funds to help build Medly, Medly&#39;s sounds, loops and songs - all these things cost an enormous amount of money and we&#39;re just a small company. To put it more bluntly: without Member - Medly wouldn&#39;t exist.<br /><br />Right now - we have one of the best free offerings in the App Store and we&#39;re incredibly proud of this. As such, we have no desire to add more free content to Medly. If you&#39;d like access to more content, you&#39;ll have to become a Member.</p>

Snap between points or the automation grid to achieve point perfect precision, and use the selection tool to edit multiple automation points together. Then open the effect picker to quickly see the automation graphs of all effects within a Section.\n\nFIND YOUR SOUND\nWith over 300 instruments and thousands of loops and samples, Medly 6 delivers new ways to discover sounds.

But the monthly pack release schedule takes away a lot of time from developing great new features. We tried to resolve this by doing a new pack one month and updating an existing pack the next, but the updates took just as much time as new packs. So we feel it’s important to revise our release schedule once again to strike a balance between releasing new exciting packs and new features. Moving forward, we plan to release new sounds on an irregular schedule, aiming for 3-6 packs per calendar year.\n\nThough that may not seem like many packs, you should expect feature updates to be released more frequently with Medly 6.

The first time you open the note editor, you’ll be presented with a tutorial that will guide you through the latest gestures.\n\nDOUBLE DOWN ON AUDIO\nAlongside a refreshed look, you can now have 2 audio clips within a single Section. Members will also be excited to hear that they can now record audio for up to 30 seconds!\n\nPOINT PERFECT AUTOMATION\nA rethought automation editor now provides a slick new interface and more powerful tools. Snap between points or the automation grid to achieve point perfect precision, and use the selection tool to edit multiple automation points together. Then open the effect picker to quickly see the automation graphs of all effects within a Section.\n\nFIND YOUR SOUND\nWith over 300 instruments and thousands of loops and samples, Medly 6 delivers new ways to discover sounds. You can favorite instruments and loops, browse them by their type, and check out Medly’s new Artist profiles to view all their lyrics.\n\nINFINITE COLUMNS\nYou no longer have to press the pesky “+” button to add a new column to your song. Just scroll, and new columns will be there for you to use. Members will have access to 999 columns, and free users will be able to use 99 columns.\n\nNOTABLE CHANGES\n- Updated album design, with more prominent titles and a stronger emphasis on artwork.\n- Some album artworks have been retired and can no longer be selected. If you’re currently using artworks that have been retired, they will remain on those albums until they are changed.\n- Added new Member Exclusive album artworks.\n- Updated Template Picker to make it easier to select blank songs or discover new songs from packs.\n- Updated all pack icons to use colors.\n- Dropped support for Audiobus.\n\n\nCHANGES TO OUR PACK RELEASE SCHEDULE\n\nWith our existing library of nearly 3000 sounds, alongside all the new features released as part of Medly 6, we plan to change our pack release schedule to better fit our priorities moving forward.\n\nWe love releasing packs and have a dedicated member on our team who works full-time to develop new instruments, loops, and songs. But the monthly pack release schedule takes away a lot of time from developing great new features. We tried to resolve this by doing a new pack one month and updating an existing pack the next, but the updates took just as much time as new packs. So we feel it’s important to revise our release schedule once again to strike a balance between releasing new exciting packs and new features. Moving forward, we plan to release new sounds on an irregular schedule, aiming for 3-6 packs per calendar year.\n\nThough that may not seem like many packs, you should expect feature updates to be released more frequently with Medly 6. This change will benefit both Members and free users, and we believe it’s the right decision to make Medly the best music-making app possible.","releaseDate":"2021-06-30"},{"versionDisplay":"5.8.9","releaseNotes":"Minor Changes","releaseDate":"2021-05-05"},{"versionDisplay":"5.8.8","releaseNotes":"New Sounds Added: Lantern\n- New

From new musicians looking to get started to experienced producers, Medly has everything you need to unleash your musical spark.\n\nA Best of App Store 2016 winner, Medly’s simple interface is packed with advanced tools to create studio-quality productions. Get started for free with the Starter Pack of 17 instruments and over 100 loops and samples. You can also try Medly Member free for 7 days to unlock over 3000 instruments, loops, and exclusive features.\n\nCREATIVE CONTROL\nMusic-making can be intimidating. Medly makes it easy by breaking songs down into Sections. You can add notes, audio samples, and loops to your Sections, then copy, paste and rearrange them to build your song. At any time, use the History tool to quickly rewind and undo your changes.\n\nA MAGIC TOUCH TO NOTES\nFrom simply adding a note to complex multi-note editing, each interaction was carefully designed with touch in mind. And with over 300 instruments available to Members, you can quickly try out different sounds and find your style.\n\nAMPLIFIED AUDIO\nEdit, snap, and trim your audio clips to your liking. Record or import audio, or use a sample from Medly’s vast audio library. You can record audio up to 4 bars or become a Member and record and import audio up to 30 seconds. As a Member, bring your songs to the next level with professionally recorded vocals by Medly’s talented artists.\n\nPOINT PERFECT AUTOMATION\nAutomatically change volume, echo, and other effects to add fades and pitch bends to your sounds. Snap between points and beats to achieve point perfect precision and use the selection tool to edit multiple automation points together.

We tend to support new devices as soon as they come out, and are relatively quick on supporting essential new features that are released with Apple's annual updates. Not to mention, we're still working on new features and release new packs every month. This isn't a one-time project, that we update every once in a while (where a $5.99 one-time price tag would make sense); this is continuously iterated on product that's extremely expensive to maintain and develop.\n\nAnd we're a small company where we don't have investors - our only source of income is Member. And with Member, we've continued to make Medly better and better. There exists open source and/or free music-making apps - but none matches Medly because we dedicate everything behind it.\n\nYou may see Member as expensive, but the reality is, for $35, you could only purchase 1 or 2 packs from a third party website. With Member at $35/year, you get our access to our existing library and 12 more packs that will be released during your subscription.

You can say the price - $5.99 and even more people just will get past the MONEY barrier and you get profits better than just...before now.\n\nSay, do you know my second dream in my mind? I’d like a free, open-source Notes app replacing Medly (and free - but, people do make instruments as a donation.) And I looked at other reviews saying that a gifted teenager could make Medly. Just stop there, you could trust me for new Medly stuff. (Personally, I’d replace the Starter electronic pack with a better Electron, with the Aura (now named Electron) being the lead.) But I’d do the ripping out since my actual status is close to yours, just three years behind. The Notes ... it looks like Apple .... but maybe I would lead in the E-field later on.\n\nOh, and the musics are not just a rip-off of Gallop.

You compound that with this last major update taking a long time to be released, in large part due to COVID (more difficult to focus/work from home).\n\nBut to address the points in your comment directly: music making apps have a large spectrum of complexity. The real issue is, you have a lot on one side, the simple side, then you have the big DAWs that are hard to use on the other side, and a great big chasm in the middle. Medly falls into the simpler side, but it does inch closer to the big DAWs than most.\n\nSo it always seems frustrating “why can’t it do this!” But the answer can sometimes be complex.

It’s easy to build melodies and bass lines without hassle, pretty accurately, and it’s easy to get these files onto my phone to send them away so I can use them in a bigger song. That’s what Medley is: A small app where you can create little music samples to send off to your bigger projects on your laptop or so on (or that’s how I see it). \n\nHowever, that’s not what Medley could be. There is so much potential here.. more ways to mix audio, built in vocaloid plugins (better than the current ‘Vox’ or whatever it’s called). Packs of instruments that can go together, better tutorials for beginners, so on. Trust me, this is a great app, but I think it’s too focused on simplicity.. which I know that sounds like a good thing, but simplicity really affects professionalism, especially in this circumstance.\n\nIf Medley was able to integrate more types of mixing, more realistic instrument sounds rather than just a bunch of random synth and electric sounds that can kinds sound the same and nothing fits, and other little things that make it more professional, the community as well as Medley would benefit from that. Also, prices are fine. And there’s little bugs and freezes here and there and sometimes recordings of songs come out quiet but overall, so good.","title":"Sound focused, not development focused.","userName":"ɱ ɑɳɗ ɱ ɱʋʂꀤƈ"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4672203434","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-08-25T14:30:39Z","developerResponse":{"id":10340396,"body":"If we put in ads, we'd get complaints that every time someone got into the groove of making music, a 30 second video ad popped up.

This is an amazing app. Well designed, clean, professional. But the only thing I dislike about it is that it is expensive. Hear me out, because I am not recommending that it be free. As a hobbyist I don’t have the money to buy a membership, but having the extra samples are kind of a must if you want to make songs with variety. What if in the free version it played an ad every time you added a premium instrument to a song. It would be like renting the instrument with an ad. You wouldn’t unlock the instrument universally, only for that song. It would keep the free version restricted while allowing hobbyists to make more with the app. It would generate income from all users instead of the few that buy a Membership. It would still give plenty of incentive to buy the pro version. This is a brilliant app and I want it to keep progressing. I think it would be beneficial to both users and developer. Just an idea, Cheers!\n\nP.S It would also be cool if deleted songs went to a temporary trash. This is a relatively standard feature in many media creation applications.

Even if i did buy the Future Bass pack, it’s worth it and so cheap. Im probably soon gonna buy the master pack. Out of all the music apps I’ve used, especially Auxy studio, this is the best one. Keep up the good work plz🔥\n\nEdit: Ok, the new update is ok, but a problem. The Master and Band packs used to cost about $9.99 (or around $9) and now, I can’t buy a pack individually anymore because you apparently gotta buy some sort of trial. It was better and easier for me when I could just buy a pack on its own and have it forever instead of buying a trial including ALL instruments for a LIMITED amount of time.

If it’s important, I do use Low Power Mode often. I’d appreciate if this were patched. Other than that, Medly is great for beginning musicians; after warming up to it, it’s relatively easy to create tunes. \n\nA question I’d like to ask is if new packs as outside of membership will be released, but I’d assume not if you’re plan is to release one membership pack a month. \n\nIf you could, I’d love for the rock pack to have a dirtier guitar, or have the guitars play for an extended period of time at a consistent intensity.

At any time, use the History tool to quickly rewind and undo your changes.\n\nA MAGIC TOUCH TO NOTES\nFrom simply adding a note to complex multi-note editing, each interaction was carefully designed with touch in mind. And with over 300 instruments available to Members, you can quickly try out different sounds and find your style.\n\nAMPLIFIED AUDIO\nEdit, snap, and trim your audio clips to your liking. Record or import audio, or use a sample from Medly’s vast audio library. You can record audio up to 4 bars or become a Member and record and import audio up to 30 seconds. As a Member, bring your songs to the next level with professionally recorded vocals by Medly’s talented artists.\n\nPOINT PERFECT AUTOMATION\nAutomatically change volume, echo, and other effects to add fades and pitch bends to your sounds. Snap between points and beats to achieve point perfect precision and use the selection tool to edit multiple automation points together. Then open the effect picker to quickly see the automation graphs of all effects within a Section.\n\nSHARE AND PLAY\nQuickly upload your songs to SoundCloud, or share it as a video, audio, MIDI, or Medly file. You can also connect Medly to other apps using Inter-App Audio or play in time using Ableton Link.\n\nMADE IN CANADA\nWe’re a small team working relentlessly to make Medly possible.

Scroll with one finger, tap to add a note, and double tap and draw to add a long note. The first time you open the note editor, you’ll be presented with a tutorial that will guide you through the latest gestures.\n\nDOUBLE DOWN ON AUDIO\nAlongside a refreshed look, you can now have 2 audio clips within a single Section. Members will also be excited to hear that they can now record audio for up to 30 seconds!\n\nPOINT PERFECT AUTOMATION\nA rethought automation editor now provides a slick new interface and more powerful tools. Snap between points or the automation grid to achieve point perfect precision, and use the selection tool to edit multiple automation points together. Then open the effect picker to quickly see the automation graphs of all effects within a Section.\n\nFIND YOUR SOUND\nWith over 300 instruments and thousands of loops and samples, Medly 6 delivers new ways to discover sounds. You can favorite instruments and loops, browse them by their type, and check out Medly’s new Artist profiles to view all their lyrics.\n\nINFINITE COLUMNS\nYou no longer have to press the pesky “+” button to add a new column to your song.

But the monthly pack release schedule takes away a lot of time from developing great new features. We tried to resolve this by doing a new pack one month and updating an existing pack the next, but the updates took just as much time as new packs. So we feel it’s important to revise our release schedule once again to strike a balance between releasing new exciting packs and new features. Moving forward, we plan to release new sounds on an irregular schedule, aiming for 3-6 packs per calendar year.\n\nThough that may not seem like many packs, you should expect feature updates to be released more frequently with Medly 6.

We tried to resolve this by doing a new pack one month and updating an existing pack the next, but the updates took just as much time as new packs. So we feel it’s important to revise our release schedule once again to strike a balance between releasing new exciting packs and new features. Moving forward, we plan to release new sounds on an irregular schedule, aiming for 3-6 packs per calendar year.\n\nThough that may not seem like many packs, you should expect feature updates to be released more frequently with Medly 6. This change will benefit both Members and free users, and we believe it’s the right decision to make Medly the best music-making app possible.","releaseDate":"2021-06-30"},{"versionDisplay":"5.8.9","releaseNotes":"Minor Changes","releaseDate":"2021-05-05"},{"versionDisplay":"5.8.8","releaseNotes":"New Sounds Added: Lantern\n- New instruments and loops are taking flight, with this month's addition\n- 3 new instruments, 25 new loops, and 1 new song\n- Exclusive to Medly Member\n\n\nImportant Note\n\niOS Support:\n- After this version, we're dropping support for iOS 12\n- Moving forwards, we'll only be supporting iOS 13 and newer\n\nPack Updates:\n- For the months of April and May, we will not ship new sounds\n- We will continue our releases starting in June\n- We're not taking a break, we're just working on something big","releaseDate":"2021-03-09"},{"versionDisplay":"5.8.7","releaseNotes":"New Pack: Lantern\n- Celebrate the year of the Ox with traditional Chinese instruments\n- Lantern includes 6 instruments, 23 loops \u0026 samples, and 2 songs\n- Exclusive to Medly Member","releaseDate":"2021-02-09"},{"versionDisplay":"5.8.6","releaseNotes":"New Sounds Added: Melodic Dubstep\n- Venture deeper into the stars with these newly added sounds!\n- 8 new instruments, 43 new loops, and 1 new song\n- Featuring professionally recorded vocals\n- Exclusive to Medly Member","releaseDate":"2021-01-12"},{"versionDisplay":"5.8.5","releaseNotes":"New Pack: Melodic Dubstep\n- Let your melodies warp you to new worlds with this month’s pack!\n- Melodic Dubstep includes 10 instruments, 55 loops \u0026 samples, and 1 song\n- Featuring professionally recorded vocals\n- Exclusive to Medly Member\n\nImprovements:\n- All Member subscriptions are now compatible with Apple’s Family Sharing.\n- Fixed issue where Audio Import window would repeatedly check the clipboard for audio clips.\n- Translation fixes for Japanese localization.","releaseDate":"2020-12-08"},{"versionDisplay":"5.8.4","releaseNotes":"New Sounds:\n- We’ve added new sounds to our latest Hyperpop Pack!\n- 7 new instruments, 25 new loops, and 1 new song\n- Member Exclusive","releaseDate":"2020-11-10"},{"versionDisplay":"5.8.3","releaseNotes":"New Sounds:\n- We’ve added new sounds to our latest Hyperpop Pack!\n- 7 new instruments, 25 new loops, and 1 new song\n- Member Exclusive","releaseDate":"2020-11-10"},{"versionDisplay":"5.8.2","releaseNotes":"Bug Fixes","releaseDate":"2020-11-03"},{"versionDisplay":"5.8.1","releaseNotes":"New Pack: Hyperpop\n- Push the limits of pop music and take it into hyperdrive!\n- Hyperpop includes 8 instruments, 44 loops \u0026 samples, and 1 song\n- Featuring professionally recorded vocals\n- Exclusive to Medly Member\n\nWe’re making big changes to Medly Member:\n- We will be alternating each month between releasing a new pack and adding sounds to an existing pack.\n- We will continue to release new sounds on the second Tuesday of every month.","releaseDate":"2020-10-27"},{"versionDisplay":"5.8","releaseNotes":"New Pack: Hyperpop\n- Push the limits of pop music and take it into hyperdrive!\n- Hyperpop includes 8 instruments, 44 loops \u0026 samples, and 1 song\n- Featuring professionally recorded vocals\n- Exclusive to Medly Member\n\nWe’re making big changes to Medly Member:\n- We will be alternating each month between releasing a new pack and adding sounds to an existing pack.\n- We will continue to release new sounds on the second Tuesday of every month.","releaseDate":"2020-10-13"},{"versionDisplay":"5.7.8","releaseNotes":"Bug fixes","releaseDate":"2020-10-07"}],"languageList":["English","French","German","Italian","Japanese","Korean","Portuguese","Simplified Chinese","Spanish","Traditional Chinese"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"privacyPolicyUrl":"http://medlylabs.com/legal","requirementsString":"Requires iOS 13.0 or later.
