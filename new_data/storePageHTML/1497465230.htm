Join 100,000+ people who save time, focus better, and develop healthier screen habits. Our app uses a science-backed approach to disconnect distractions from your phone, set intentions, schedule time off, and focus on what matters to you.\n\n** Opal cuts off your apps’ internet access to help you stop doomscrolling – The Next Web **\n\n** Many people want to develop better screen-time habits, but don’t have the tools. Opal aims to help.  – TechCrunch **\n\n** Opal Helped Me Quit My Nightly TikTok Habit – Bustle **\n\nWith Opal, you can block distracting apps and sites like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Snapchat, Twitter and a lot more in one tap and end the doomscrolling.\n\nScreen time affects all of our lives. Opal is the perfect app for people looking to reduce their daily screen time, increase focus, less stress, digital detox, and better sleep. Using proprietary technology, Opal can disconnect distractions on your phone and help you stay focused and more present.\n\nYou can use Opal for however little or long as you want. Want a 20 minute deep focus session? You got it. Want to leave Opal on in the background all day? You can do that too. You can also schedule Opal to turn on automatically and block different apps at different times of the day. For example, you can block social media from 9am to 5pm and block work apps like Slack from 5pm to 9pm. Opal helps you build work-life balance with better boundaries.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n- Save up to 4 hours each day\n- Reduce stress, be more mindful\n- Improve productivity at work\n- Unplug with family and friends\n- Better sleep and happier mornings\n- Be more intentional with your phone usage\n- Stay in focus when you need it most\n- You're happy and in control of your screen time\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Create rooms and invite your friends/family/coworkers to unplug with you\n- Create custom Pomodoro timers\n- Disconnect distracting apps and block sites on your phone for as little or as long as you want.\n- Set a timer and write an intention before using distracting apps.\n- Start a deep focus session with a timer you can't bypass.\n- Schedule focus time daily where apps will automatically start blocking. For example during your Sleep, Work, Morning, and Study schedules.\n- Check your progress with “Time Saved”. Every time Opal blocks a distracting app we calculate the time you saved. \"Blocked distractions'\" will let you know each time Opal prevents a distracting app from connecting.\n\nCREATE A PERSONALIZED APP LIST\n\nYou can add or remove Apps and Websites that are distracting to you directly from Opal's settings in the app.\n\nYou can customize your Opal experience and block many distracting apps and sites including:\n- Facebook\n- Instagram\n- Snapchat\n- TikTok\n- Youtube\n- Netflix\n- Tinder\n- Hinge\n- Bumble\n- And so much more including News, Messaging, Dating, Adult/Porn, Money apps etc.\n\n\nUNIQUE TECHNOLOGY\n\nWe use Apple's local VPN technology in order to monitor and disconnect apps you use.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Ciao! Buongiorno! Come stai? Bene? Benissimo!!!<br />Hehehe, I went to Italy for a small vacation and I got back something for you all!<br />I got the freshest and ripest tomatoessssssss =D<br /><br />INTRODUCING POMODORO IN OPAL<br />From this update, you can create sessions to follow the pomodoro technique if that&#39;s something that&#39;s been helpful to you! You can set a custom work length, break length, and how many cycles you need it to run and Opal will handle the rest for you like magic!<br />This has been a highly requested feature so we hope you all like it! Let us know your thoughts on socials by tagging @withopal!<br /><br />FREE SCHEDULE FOR THE FREE PLAN<br />We&#39;ve seen how valuable schedules have been to our gems and we want more people to experience what Opal&#39;s like on auto-pilot so we&#39;ve now made it possible to create one recurring schedule for free if you aren&#39;t subscribed to Pro. Until now gems on the free plan were only able to create one-off schedules. We hope this shows the value of Opal to more people!<br /><br />BETTER TROUBLESHOOTING<br />If you&#39;re facing any issues and think Opal&#39;s VPN is the reason why, we&#39;ve now added the ability to detect and fix any VPN issues in our Settings tab.<br /><br />And that&#39;s pretty much it for today&#39;s update! We&#39;ve been working on this for a while and are super excited to finally release it to everyone!<br />If you aren&#39;t already, feel free to join our Discord community from https://opal.pm/discord where you can chat with our team and other gems like you!<br /><br />Until next time,<br />Arrivederci!<br />- Opal</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>At first I was like, “This is silly. I’m not paying for self-control.” But in the week trial, I finished 2 books, something I haven’t been able to do in years. For some very serious reasons, I struggle with mindfulness and disassociating by scrolling on my phone. Opal’s focus on maintaining mindfulness really helped me in a way I didn’t anticipate. I appreciated the easy, friendly interface, and I love the option to allow yourself to pause from using Opal or set your app to not allow you to override it until the timer is up. It’s been really helpful. <br /><br />It’s been 6 days and I believe I’ve only taken about 2 hours total to get back to focusing on either reading or errands or simply breaking the momentum with my phone, but those 2 hours were so valuable to me. <br /><br />You can either beat yourself up for not having the self-control, or you can understand yourself and give yourself the grace and handicap where you might need them. I love Opal!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Overall, I love Opal! It’s really helping me stay on task during my assignments, and I think that the UI is absolutely gorgeous. This is really smart! One thing I wish the app did was disconnect the VPN when it’s not actively blocking apps and only connect to it when Opal is turned on, it’s a little bit of a privacy concern having the VPN connected when it’s not doing anything. It would be much better for privacy if the VPN was only connected when Opal is on, instead of having to scroll down to the bottom of the settings page to disconnect the VPN. At the very least, move the disconnect VPN button to somewhere more accessible (the main home screen would be best). I get that it’s necessary for the scheduling to work, but maybe instead there could simply be a pop-up warning the user that disabling the VPN will turn off scheduling (if there’s any enabled schedules) when you hit the disconnect button, instead of hiding it away. he amount of features you can use with the free tier is really great, too! They don’t force you to upgrade to the Pro plan to use the app, all the main functionalities are available for free and the other paid ones (like Scheduling and Focus Timer) let you try them out to see how it works.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hey there! Thank you for the review, we&#39;re so grateful to have you on Opal! 🙂 The primary reasons the VPN remains on even while you are not using Opal is because it allows you to start and stop sessions quickly, and to utilize scheduled sessions as you mentioned. 😊 If you have any further questions please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at any time! – Team Opal 💎</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I never write app reviews, but I really wanted to share just how great Opal worked for me! I had a really bad phone addiction, I would spend 8-10 hours on my phone and it really messed everything up for me— from being unable to focus on my classes to my mental state. I tried getting a burner cell, deleting all the distracting apps, yet it never lasted long. tbh, I didn’t think Opal would work as well (after all, it’s just an app, right?). But, after downloading my screen time went down to 5-6 hours and I feel much better now. I think a part of it is just how seamless Opal is at stopping all of the distractions. The apps seem like they work, yet they don’t refresh so u can be saved from hours of “mindless scrolling” but still get the effect of being connected to the world.<br />All in all, I think this app is pretty genius and I’m very thankful to everyone who worked on it bc it is truly amazing!</p>

You can set a custom work length, break length, and how many cycles you need it to run and Opal will handle the rest for you like magic!\nThis has been a highly requested feature so we hope you all like it! Let us know your thoughts on socials by tagging @withopal!\n\nFREE SCHEDULE FOR THE FREE PLAN\nWe've seen how valuable schedules have been to our gems and we want more people to experience what Opal's like on auto-pilot so we've now made it possible to create one recurring schedule for free if you aren't subscribed to Pro. Until now gems on the free plan were only able to create one-off schedules. We hope this shows the value of Opal to more people!\n\nBETTER TROUBLESHOOTING\nIf you're facing any issues and think Opal's VPN is the reason why, we've now added the ability to detect and fix any VPN issues in our Settings tab.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it for today's update! We've been working on this for a while and are super excited to finally release it to everyone!\nIf you aren't already, feel free to join our Discord community from https://opal.pm/discord where you can chat with our team and other gems like you!\n\nUntil next time,\nArrivederci!\n- Opal","releaseDate":"2021-11-08"},{"versionDisplay":"2.31","releaseNotes":"Henloooo henlooo!

I hope you've been doing okay with the seasons changing and all _/\\_\n\nIn this week's update, we have a bunch of exciting things to share! ^_^\n\n- You can now start an Opal Session with a Siri Shortcut! You can use it to disconnect automatically when you enable Do not Disturb, or when you arrive at work, or even include it within your existing Shortcut workflows! The possibilities are endless and we are excited to see what you create! :D\n\n- You can now create 'App Groups' where you can customize what apps you want to block during different Opal sessions. You can have a group for your most distracting social apps, or your work apps etc. and block those preset apps in one-tap rather than manually selecting what apps to block each time. We hope you like it!\n\nOur team has been super hands on at making Opal significantly better for old gems and new gems alike and we're shaping our product based on all the feedback lovely people like you continue to give us. We really appreciate you!

I’m not paying for self-control.” But in the week trial, I finished 2 books, something I haven’t been able to do in years. For some very serious reasons, I struggle with mindfulness and disassociating by scrolling on my phone. Opal’s focus on maintaining mindfulness really helped me in a way I didn’t anticipate. I appreciated the easy, friendly interface, and I love the option to allow yourself to pause from using Opal or set your app to not allow you to override it until the timer is up. It’s been really helpful. \n\nIt’s been 6 days and I believe I’ve only taken about 2 hours total to get back to focusing on either reading or errands or simply breaking the momentum with my phone, but those 2 hours were so valuable to me. \n\nYou can either beat yourself up for not having the self-control, or you can understand yourself and give yourself the grace and handicap where you might need them.

Thank you for the review, we're so grateful to have you on Opal! 🙂 The primary reasons the VPN remains on even while you are not using Opal is because it allows you to start and stop sessions quickly, and to utilize scheduled sessions as you mentioned. 😊 If you have any further questions please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at any time! – Team Opal 💎","modified":"2021-01-23T03:35:14Z"},"rating":4,"review":"Overall, I love Opal! It’s really helping me stay on task during my assignments, and I think that the UI is absolutely gorgeous. This is really smart! One thing I wish the app did was disconnect the VPN when it’s not actively blocking apps and only connect to it when Opal is turned on, it’s a little bit of a privacy concern having the VPN connected when it’s not doing anything. It would be much better for privacy if the VPN was only connected when Opal is on, instead of having to scroll down to the bottom of the settings page to disconnect the VPN. At the very least, move the disconnect VPN button to somewhere more accessible (the main home screen would be best). I get that it’s necessary for the scheduling to work, but maybe instead there could simply be a pop-up warning the user that disabling the VPN will turn off scheduling (if there’s any enabled schedules) when you hit the disconnect button, instead of hiding it away. he amount of features you can use with the free tier is really great, too! They don’t force you to upgrade to the Pro plan to use the app, all the main functionalities are available for free and the other paid ones (like Scheduling and Focus Timer) let you try them out to see how it works.","title":"Great app, a few pieces of feedback","userName":"thecommamaster"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7117042253","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-03-18T15:26:29Z","developerResponse":{"id":21763746,"body":"Hey gem!

I had a really bad phone addiction, I would spend 8-10 hours on my phone and it really messed everything up for me— from being unable to focus on my classes to my mental state. I tried getting a burner cell, deleting all the distracting apps, yet it never lasted long. tbh, I didn’t think Opal would work as well (after all, it’s just an app, right?). But, after downloading my screen time went down to 5-6 hours and I feel much better now. I think a part of it is just how seamless Opal is at stopping all of the distractions. The apps seem like they work, yet they don’t refresh so u can be saved from hours of “mindless scrolling” but still get the effect of being connected to the world.\nAll in all, I think this app is pretty genius and I’m very thankful to everyone who worked on it bc it is truly amazing!","title":"Opal is very pog","userName":"Oxford Comma supporter"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6980115523","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-11T05:34:42Z","developerResponse":{"id":21071014,"body":"Hey there!

I high highly recommend everyone to get it, because it will truly help you become more productive since this app actually blocks distracting apps and incentivized mindful usage only. Opal encourages you to stop procrastinating with a direct solution, unlike most other apps.\n\nThere is one slight improvement I would recommend, however. For the list of distracting apps, it currently only gives the categories but it would be really helpful if it allows us to select/deselect specific apps. For instance, Reddit is considered social media and I blocked social media, but I use Reddit as a source of news. The category of apps can sometimes be subjective, so adding this specific option would be very nice!","title":"First App to Actually Improve My Productivity","userName":"MonkeyGurl.XD"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7465974690","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-06-15T03:34:44Z","rating":4,"review":"As someone who is trying to limit my own screen time, this app is perfect compared to others that are more geared towards parental controls. Cute and easy interface that actually does encourage you to be mindful of how you’re spending your time. However, I wish the apps I can block were more customizable and reflective of the apps I have on my phone rather than just the general categories and apps offered. There are random apps that distract me that don’t fall under the listed apps, and why aren’t games on there?? Seems like a no-brained. Not everyone is distracted by the same apps but half the apps that are blocked aren’t even downloaded on my phone! Would be 5 stars if the i could block apps from a list of what I have on my phone or at least have a category for games.

Download Opal! I’ve tried the built in app-blocking features that come with apple products, but they were too easy to bypass. Opal has a feature that actually blocks apps and makes them completely unusable for the time period you set. Absolute lifesaver and game changer! I recommend this to everyone! Only complaint is that there are sometimes bugs that allow me to still get notifications/messages on snapchat and instagram.","title":"WORTH IT!

Voila. If you’re really struggling with social media addiction this is the best app I could personally find. It’s expensive for the yearly membership but what’s a mere 60$ for more focused days and 2xs the productivity? Please try the free trial and atleast test out my setup, I feel like the app will speak for itself at that point. BUT… you must be disciplined with this, like all things in life.

My biggest issue is spending hours both scrolling through social media AND wasting too much of my time on web browsers. I have ADHD and my urges to google everything that pops into my head is out of control. I’m not able to block many of the apps/websites that are my biggest distractions, so I instead have to block internet access completely. This is really frustrating because sometimes I still need to do basic things like check the weather or see if a prescription is ready on a pharmacy app. If there was an option where we could block all internet access except for a few apps, this would be perfect for me.","title":"Wish there was more flexibility in which apps can be blocked or unblocked.","userName":"Jgsgugkf"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7433464205","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-06-06T13:24:48Z","developerResponse":{"id":23266631,"body":"Hey there, thank you for taking the time to leave us a review.We're sorry you had a buggy first experience, we just issued a fix for the under-blocking bugs and it should work as intended now. We release a new update every week where we make our product better for everyone and sometimes bugs happen which we then fix immediately. Just to be clear, Opal not only blocks websites on Safari, we also disconnect the internet access from distracting apps and sites so even the respective apps wouldn't work - other apps like Forest don't do this.We hope you can update the app and give us another try.Best,Team Opal","modified":"2021-06-08T14:07:37Z"},"rating":1,"review":"While this effectively blocked certain apps for about 30 minutes, I began getting social media notifications and messages while the VPN was supposedly on, so this app does not work. I used the option to block the internet entirely, rather than selecting specific apps, and I was still able to freely use Safari to web browse. In fact, I am able to post this review while Opal’s VPN is supposedly on and “blocking my Internet”. It’s very unclear to me why this app or service would cost $90 a year when the iPhone allows you in the settings to set restrictions on apps and block certain websites on Safari entirely...alternatively Forest is another app which seems to do most of the same things (including providing those badges if they incentivize you at all...) which has a one time upfront cost far lower than the Opal subscription. I would’ve left 0 stars if possible.","title":"Stopped Blocking Apps 30 Min

Until now gems on the free plan were only able to create one-off schedules.
