        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Thank you so much for the update. I’ve sent you several reviews since I first downloaded this app, but I just keep getting more and more ideas, and I thought you ought to here them. First things first, I LOVE the update and it’s just what I imagined when I wrote my last review suggesting it. The horses are perfect! And the fact that you can ride them makes it even better. The new skins and character customization is on point! It’s perfect and I think this is one of the best updates I have witnessed so far! Secondly, I would love to be able to visit my sisters house in her single player world, because you can actually build in the single player, instead of the multiplayer. I’ve requested the several times, I think you should be Be able to build in the multiplayer servers, or be able to invite your friends into your single player, or maybe have a private server for just you and your friends! It would be much apretiated if you put my ideas into thaught.  That’s all for now, but I’m sure I will send another review your way soon with more ideas that could make your game even better, even though considering that it’s free, it’s hard to make it better then it already is, goodbye.</p>

    I love it but I have a few ideas

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have a few ideas that I think would make building much more fun. Most of my ideas are for the tracks. Now I know they are for mining but me and my friends mainly like using them for roller coasters. I think if you made some tracks specifically for roller coasters it would be more fun. The different tracks I have in mind are: A loop track capable of being up side down, A track that moves them but goes slow which would be used for when you want the person to just look at the surroundings for a minute, a speed track that will push them up hills easier without having to continuously tap, and a track that can go straight up and I think this track should also have speed in it. I think that it would still be useful if you left the normal ones you now have as well for when your going down a hill and you don’t want to go extra fast or slow. Also something that I’ve been wanting in MultiCraft for a while is an owl. I think these would be really cool and I think that you should be able to ride them like you would a horse but you can fly while riding them. My sister also has been saying that she wants a tiger (they’re her favorite animal) and I agree that that would be very cool. I know these things are kind of extravagant but I think it would make it way more fun. So I hope that you read this and take my ideas into consideration. Thank you</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Yup, the game where the only updates are in multiplayer and single player. NONE in host server. Besides u can’t even craft cherry planks in work bench.i suggest 2 mak paintings resizable. And bluestone is SOO limited. U can’t even make a door with a button on the block next 2 it open da door. U can make bluestone travel thru a block. So there is a lever on one side on the other is a mechanism that gives u a waterfall. That wud be great! Add some dispensers or hoppers. Dat wud be good 2. And make lava and water somewhat place able. I mean, ur gonna be lucky if u place ONE lava or water bucket down. Wuts da point of tnt if it does nothing it multiplayer??? Mak it so that tnt only explodes in UNPROTECTED areas. Commands, they r great but not best. Add commands like: /killall or /grantall or /seeinv (use seeinv to edit and see others inventory). Mobs. Once u have iron armour mobs can’t even damage u. Add more mobs and make em’ more aggressive. Skins. Wouldn’t it be great if u cud custom skins! Add a skin area 2 mak ur own skin. Also maybe the name ‘Player’ wud be a bit annoying in some cases. It’d be great if u cud change it. In the new update I can’t sit on sofa or even SLEEP ON A BED!!! Ya, u betta fix dat. Adding shields and fixing n’ fishing rods wud be good 2! Ok, so all da things I told u r best fixed or added ASAP. Bye, lik ur game!</p>

I’ve sent you several reviews since I first downloaded this app, but I just keep getting more and more ideas, and I thought you ought to here them. First things first, I LOVE the update and it’s just what I imagined when I wrote my last review suggesting it. The horses are perfect! And the fact that you can ride them makes it even better. The new skins and character customization is on point! It’s perfect and I think this is one of the best updates I have witnessed so far! Secondly, I would love to be able to visit my sisters house in her single player world, because you can actually build in the single player, instead of the multiplayer. I’ve requested the several times, I think you should be Be able to build in the multiplayer servers, or be able to invite your friends into your single player, or maybe have a private server for just you and your friends! It would be much apretiated if you put my ideas into thaught.  That’s all for now, but I’m sure I will send another review your way soon with more ideas that could make your game even better, even though considering that it’s free, it’s hard to make it better then it already is, goodbye.","title":"Thank you for the update!

Most of my ideas are for the tracks. Now I know they are for mining but me and my friends mainly like using them for roller coasters. I think if you made some tracks specifically for roller coasters it would be more fun. The different tracks I have in mind are: A loop track capable of being up side down, A track that moves them but goes slow which would be used for when you want the person to just look at the surroundings for a minute, a speed track that will push them up hills easier without having to continuously tap, and a track that can go straight up and I think this track should also have speed in it. I think that it would still be useful if you left the normal ones you now have as well for when your going down a hill and you don’t want to go extra fast or slow. Also something that I’ve been wanting in MultiCraft for a while is an owl. I think these would be really cool and I think that you should be able to ride them like you would a horse but you can fly while riding them. My sister also has been saying that she wants a tiger (they’re her favorite animal) and I agree that that would be very cool. I know these things are kind of extravagant but I think it would make it way more fun. So I hope that you read this and take my ideas into consideration.

NONE in host server. Besides u can’t even craft cherry planks in work bench.i suggest 2 mak paintings resizable. And bluestone is SOO limited. U can’t even make a door with a button on the block next 2 it open da door. U can make bluestone travel thru a block. So there is a lever on one side on the other is a mechanism that gives u a waterfall. That wud be great! Add some dispensers or hoppers. Dat wud be good 2. And make lava and water somewhat place able. I mean, ur gonna be lucky if u place ONE lava or water bucket down. Wuts da point of tnt if it does nothing it multiplayer??? Mak it so that tnt only explodes in UNPROTECTED areas. Commands, they r great but not best. Add commands like: /killall or /grantall or /seeinv (use seeinv to edit and see others inventory). Mobs. Once u have iron armour mobs can’t even damage u. Add more mobs and make em’ more aggressive. Skins. Wouldn’t it be great if u cud custom skins! Add a skin area 2 mak ur own skin. Also maybe the name ‘Player’ wud be a bit annoying in some cases. It’d be great if u cud change it. In the new update I can’t sit on sofa or even SLEEP ON A BED!!! Ya, u betta fix dat. Adding shields and fixing n’ fishing rods wud be good 2! Ok, so all da things I told u r best fixed or added ASAP.

You could add like maybe a way to make a portal to a different dimension, like maybe a candy dimension. You could also add leashes and make it so you put a leash on multiple animals or villagers at a time and be able to put them in boats and minecarts. You could also make it so that all commands are accessible by everyone, even in other people’s servers were people who don’t own the server can change time if their is no one else on the server. You could also make it so that the only way to remove potion effects is by drinking milk so that the potions last longer. You could also add a button in the character customizer that when you press it a screen pops up we’re you can make your own skin and save it in a album that stores all your custom skins that you saved.

I don’t get how to tame animals and keep them from moving once when i was on survival my horse almost fell into a pit and i had to ride it to guide it away. I think the traders should trade not only with gems and maybe make a metal detector so u can find gems and a compass so u can find ur way around easily. I dont know how to go down ladders on a computer. i made a server and it gets really annoying when i try to use buckets. it says “too much lava/liquid is bad, right?” and even if im on creative i need to use 500 buckets to fill up one hole. the ant wasnt working and i tried to figure out if it was just the area i was in but tnt doesnt work any where in my server. \nsorry if it seems like too much overall this game is the best","title":"Game is awesome","userName":"Mr. Bananas Jr."},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7194859533","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-04-07T16:34:50Z","rating":5,"review":"Ok, this is a really good game.

Also, if the people that made this added on the ability to change from creative to survival that would make this a even better game than it already is! \n\nThat was my old review. Some people on nicos survival server know me as member, or Poseidon. Some people hate this game, although I don’t know why. I made a zombie apocalypse in this game and it turned out amazing! I also am confused on why people say that this game has so many ads. I get the ads too, but not anymore. All I had to do was just turn off WiFi and no more ads for member. Plus I love the sever options! The reviews on people that hate this game are stupid. In my opinion, yes this game is based off of minecraft and that is WHY I love it so much.

This is a great game I love that there are actual name tags for naming animals, lots of blocks to choose from, and lots more! But I think it needs more animals. I would really LOVE if you added actual dogs in the game! (Preferably whippets, bloodhounds, and really just random mixed breeds)not just a tamed wolf. And horses and donkeys that you can ride would be awesome!! And maybe some animal accessories? ( dog food bowls so you don’t have to hand feed them and collars for dogs and cats)Oh, and being able to level up your pet wolf with talents would be sooo awesome!! A few more thing: leads! It can be hard to lure your pet into your house so can you put leads in please? I noticed my wolf can’t go into a single block door or fence gate or something like that. Could you make them be able to go through a single block space? Last thing! The  wolves will fall behind when they’re following you so maybe you could level them up to be fast or they could teleport to you! That all, thanks for making this game!
