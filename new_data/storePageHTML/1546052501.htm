    Way more than just a “generative music app”
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Wotja often presents itself as a plug and go generative music app but that does it a great injustice. Much is made of the serendipitous text to music (which it has), it also has a built-in modular synth if you wish to use it but for me its richest feature is as a composer’s tool. If you put in the time to learn it, it can help you quickly compose either note by note or by key or by providing general instructions to its own rule engine. For example, I’ll use a voice to provide a bass line, make a follower voice to create chords from the base line, create another voice to Arpeggiate over the chords played and so on. Using Wotja’s grid, you can go left to right with a few key change variations, borrowed chords or whatever strikes your fancy. Now with the AU3 support, you can control multiple synths easily with MIDI in AUM or some other host. Wotja is far and away my favorite way to kickstart a combo or jazz piece that I later layer on EWI or played parts. With AUM I an mix and match Wotja with drum engines and other tools. Wotja is developed by a very small responsive team and always brings new inspiration with each release.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love this years additions to Wotja. Overall it’s a very solid app. It plays nicely with everything (midi and synth) on my iPhone and iPad that I have tried so far.<br /><br />The only problem I can say I have is the support for Sonos on the Apple TV. In short I would like to use my Sonos speakers with the Wotja Apple TV app and it does not work. Not the worst thing in the world but TV speakers are not great. I’m sort of confused about the use case for the Apple watch app. It’s weird when I turn off Bluetooth, WIFI and put my phone in airplane mode, it still triggers sound on my phone by the Wotja watch app. I’m not sure how these communications are happening, NFC? It makes me question airplane mode from an Apple perspective if communication is still happening. I would maybe use the watch app for a run when I don’t want to take my phone with me and take my watch instead. I suppose it might be too much for a smart watch to handle at this point but the watch app is nice anyway. Maybe when Apple watches get higher specs in the future.<br /><br />Worth the money I think. I use Wotja usually daily.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>We are glad to hear you use Wotja regularly and many thanks indeed for your kind words - they really mean a lot to us. We implemented support for AirPlay in 21.2.0 which should mean Wotja will now be able to play through your Sonos speakers. :). I guess that one day Apple Watches will have a big enough battery to make on-watch music generation feasible, but it is hard to see when that day might arrive. So, for now, the watch app is a companion app used to stop/start Wotja music generation on an iOS device. I hope that makes sense! Best wishes, Tim</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>These guys have been on the forefront of generative composition since the SSEYO days and have never looked back.  Every subsequent version has armed composers with more and more options.  The latest update includes an AU plug-in ensuring better integration with the DAW environment.  It&#39;s the best reason to upgrade to Catalina if you have not already done so.<br />In terms of support, Tim and Pete are to be commended for their quick response to any issues or questions you may have.<br />Check it out and make sure you have the time because the musical voyages will be endless!</p>

Much is made of the serendipitous text to music (which it has), it also has a built-in modular synth if you wish to use it but for me its richest feature is as a composer’s tool. If you put in the time to learn it, it can help you quickly compose either note by note or by key or by providing general instructions to its own rule engine. For example, I’ll use a voice to provide a bass line, make a follower voice to create chords from the base line, create another voice to Arpeggiate over the chords played and so on. Using Wotja’s grid, you can go left to right with a few key change variations, borrowed chords or whatever strikes your fancy. Now with the AU3 support, you can control multiple synths easily with MIDI in AUM or some other host. Wotja is far and away my favorite way to kickstart a combo or jazz piece that I later layer on EWI or played parts. With AUM I an mix and match Wotja with drum engines and other tools. Wotja is developed by a very small responsive team and always brings new inspiration with each release.","title":"Way more than just a “generative music app”","userName":"Oldlibmike"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6838284690","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-01-06T16:54:46Z","developerResponse":{"id":20704869,"body":"We are glad to hear you use Wotja regularly and many thanks indeed for your kind words - they really mean a lot to us.

Overall it’s a very solid app. It plays nicely with everything (midi and synth) on my iPhone and iPad that I have tried so far.\n\nThe only problem I can say I have is the support for Sonos on the Apple TV. In short I would like to use my Sonos speakers with the Wotja Apple TV app and it does not work. Not the worst thing in the world but TV speakers are not great. I’m sort of confused about the use case for the Apple watch app. It’s weird when I turn off Bluetooth, WIFI and put my phone in airplane mode, it still triggers sound on my phone by the Wotja watch app. I’m not sure how these communications are happening, NFC? It makes me question airplane mode from an Apple perspective if communication is still happening. I would maybe use the watch app for a run when I don’t want to take my phone with me and take my watch instead. I suppose it might be too much for a smart watch to handle at this point but the watch app is nice anyway. Maybe when Apple watches get higher specs in the future.\n\nWorth the money I think.
