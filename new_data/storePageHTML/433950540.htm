Download this app now. You will have full navigation capabilities to get safely back to port. Better yet, buy iSailGPS today so you will already have it if you find yourself in this situation, even in an area with no cell service. No sign up, ads, subscription, or in-app purchase required, making this less expensive, less hassle &amp; more privacy respecting than the “free” or subscription apps.\n\nTRACKS, WAYPOINTS, ROUTES\n\nRecord a track. View it on the chart &amp; in a speed graph. Record in the background. View time of track points.\n\nMark waypoints by their position on a chart or satellite map, by searching for a place name or address, by tapping a geotagged photo, or by projecting from a known point. Refine a waypoint position when you arrive.\n\nSet a quick GoTo waypoint or a full route and see the course (COG), heading (HDG), bearing (BRG), direction, distance, cross track error (XTE), Velocity Made Good (VMG) and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) at your destination and intermediate points. Ideal for racing.\n\nMan Overboard (MOB). With one button push, mark your current position &amp; start navigating to it.\n\nCreate routes using waypoints, recorded tracks, or imported GPX, KML or TCX files. Advanced route editing.\n\nExport GPX and KML waypoint, route &amp; track files via eMail, Messages, Copy to, AirDrop, iCloud Drive, Dropbox or iTunes.\n\nSend data to display immediately in Google Earth.\n\nView and share the sun and moon position and rise &amp; set times for any time and any place on earth.\n\nUSA NOAA RASTER NAUTICAL CHARTS\n\nNo extra charge for access to all NOAA RNC Charts for USA waters. Download using WiFi or cell service.\n\nStore up to 1024 charts to use anytime at sea without cell service. Charts from our server download faster &amp; use less of your monthly data allotment.\n\nStitches charts &amp; automatically switches between downloaded charts as you sail. Choose detailed or overview charts.\n\nPrint &amp; Share map images overlaid with waypoints, routes &amp; tracks.\n\nMeasure distance &amp; direction between any 2 points.\n\nNOAA charts don't include most inland rivers &amp; small lakes. Use our iHikeGPS app for these.\n\nHOW TOS\n\nTap Help in the app.\nOnline Manual: isailgps.com\nEmail developer: lwjames@isailgps.com\n\nRASTER CHARTS VS. VECTOR CHARTS\n\nThe National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration provides both RNC (raster) &amp; ENC (vector) charts.\n\nThe great advantage of the high resolution RNC charts used by iSailGPS is the high level of detail produced by professional cartographers that is unobtainable on any vector-based chart. ENC Vector Charts only show a coastline, water depth, navigation aids &amp; minimal details.\n\nThese RNC Charts differ from vector charts in that each chart covers a specific area, just as paper nautical charts do. Switches automatically to a new chart when your boat leaves the area covered by the previous chart. For most locations, there are multiple charts at different scales with different levels of detail &amp; areas of coverage.\n\nPaper charts can have multiple panels, each showing a different area or scale. Each digital panel is individually displayed by iSailGPS with a north-up orientation.\n\nOther more expensive marine software uses these same RNC charts. iSail GPS is priced to make it readily available to all boating enthusiasts.\n\nDEVICE REQUIREMENTS\n\nNo device requires a cellular data plan to use iSailGPS.\n\nWiFi+cellular iPad 2 or later, &amp; iPhone 4S or later support full navigation.\n\niPad 2 or later with WiFi-only, &amp; iPod touch (5th gen or later) require an iOS-compatible external GPS receiver to show your location on the water and to record tracks. View charts using the iOS device alone.\n\n\nWinner of the Practical Sailor Editors’ Choice Award.\n\nSailing becomes safer and more fun with iSailGPS!","screenshot":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/c8/13/48/c813480f-5f60-614b-872c-eb3e37eac9cb/d1348e46-63ab-40d9-81d5-dc57198d477d_ToGoldenGateiPhone6_5.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/0c/00/21/0c002190-e22a-bf51-6828-7814c647ce83/ee983ad8-171d-4b8b-9e59-5731f8d9347c_TrackTimeDate6_5wp.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/87/62/e7/8762e753-b897-55c1-c359-b01dfb082d25/0b3d14c2-f6fc-4d12-af87-5059a2424c19_CruzBayIphone6_5.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/95/bf/3d/95bf3d87-be08-dc30-4d19-7fb6ea8e4b07/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/02/ba/fb/02bafb32-2905-eef3-069b-a25c057eb938/58d8fcc8-b6fe-4155-b445-6e1981ec4373_SanDiegoBay6_5.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/d9/a0/6d/d9a06d53-6d58-140e-eb8e-52c35d53401f/c5d819b5-66e1-40bf-978e-a213bd281e13_ApostleIslandsSocial6_5.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/a1/98/98/a19898b8-14e8-91cc-6aed-82a905314f3b/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/ee/28/0e/ee280e04-3499-99b5-0dd3-c9648e6a968d/58bca636-8da9-4501-8f8a-e71e6c25f302_SunAndMoon6_5.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/45/29/c7/4529c71c-2f10-6006-764d-11ab14bccb14/5ff80b53-165f-4031-b936-3e1f5edf7f3c_ToGoldenGateIpad-8.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/64/6a/9d/646a9d13-df06-1da7-7db3-a0b693ea2685/f5db6549-f976-4c2a-b186-e83405345712_TrackTimeDateIpad-9_7wp.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/25/2e/ea/252eeaa3-3fe6-08a0-7ece-0394cf25e2ed/971fb57c-2a31-4aae-8b94-c9649aa7360f_markSausalitoiPad-8.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/86/3a/6e/863a6ea5-4908-cdf3-7cd5-31986f401cb7/cd4fd82a-876d-425a-a218-e93773175b21_CruzBayiPadHR-8.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/a0/db/67/a0db676e-92b7-8487-916f-bb920bb67ff1/pr_source.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/7d/43/be/7d43bef6-8f03-f581-29e3-b9f6dacbb542/90ab9369-ff96-45a5-9e03-f23e6d1eaf9c_ApostleIslandsSocialIpad-9_7.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/75/3d/c9/753dc9df-38dc-e2a6-3cf5-6495f906432f/0762a5a2-c63a-47d8-aebe-341a7e51a33d_SanDiegoBayIpad9_7.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource115/v4/55/a7/97/55a79732-27a4-a2d9-ca9d-939112526ee2/c63d1276-f3e5-4ae4-8193-ee5bddce63ab_SunAndMoonIPad9_7.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/86/00/41/8600417e-1581-f3d2-8fc8-2c6c084ed482/cdc84f1e-fbe2-48fb-a70f-dc0b0b4ce26e_ChartListIpad9_7.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/7a/ba/e5/7abae5cd-ef6d-bb3a-d496-d460261715fb/4a8deab1-1968-45ef-b81f-4f69f16615de_WikipediaIpad9_7.png/643x0w.jpg"],"image":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/56/1b/b4/561bb42f-07b6-5b41-d86f-6a63e7d422c7/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/1200x630wa.png","applicationCategory":"Navigation","datePublished":"Apr 28, 2011","operatingSystem":"Requires iOS 9.3 or later.

VECTOR CHARTS<br /><br />The National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration provides both RNC (raster) &amp; ENC (vector) charts.<br /><br />The great advantage of the high resolution RNC charts used by iSailGPS is the high level of detail produced by professional cartographers that is unobtainable on any vector-based chart. ENC Vector Charts only show a coastline, water depth, navigation aids &amp; minimal details.<br /><br />These RNC Charts differ from vector charts in that each chart covers a specific area, just as paper nautical charts do. Switches automatically to a new chart when your boat leaves the area covered by the previous chart. For most locations, there are multiple charts at different scales with different levels of detail &amp; areas of coverage.<br /><br />Paper charts can have multiple panels, each showing a different area or scale. Each digital panel is individually displayed by iSailGPS with a north-up orientation.<br /><br />Other more expensive marine software uses these same RNC charts. iSail GPS is priced to make it readily available to all boating enthusiasts.<br /><br />DEVICE REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />No device requires a cellular data plan to use iSailGPS.<br /><br />WiFi+cellular iPad 2 or later, &amp; iPhone 4S or later support full navigation.<br /><br />iPad 2 or later with WiFi-only, &amp; iPod touch (5th gen or later) require an iOS-compatible external GPS receiver to show your location on the water and to record tracks. View charts using the iOS device alone.<br /><br /><br />Winner of the Practical Sailor Editors’ Choice Award.<br /><br />Sailing becomes safer and more fun with iSailGPS!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I&#39;m continually improving this app so it will be even more useful! This version improves the human interface layout on the new iPad mini.<br /><br />Only on older devices running iOS 9, chart downloads quit working on 9/30/21 due to an expiring html security certificate. This version drops the use of that expired certificate, allowing iSailGPS on those older devices to again function properly.<br /><br />What&#39;s new in iSailGPS when compared with other available NOAA chart apps?<br /><br />• You don&#39;t just see waypoints and routes displayed on the chart, you can actually do real great circle navigation to those waypoints and along those routes. You get information such as Estimated Time of Arrival, current bearing and heading, and remaining distance to your intermediate and final destinations.<br /><br />• You don&#39;t just see individual charts. Whenever the map projection is compatible (which it is most cases), you can see adjacent charts with their margins removed stitched together seamlessly, even when the chart scales are different. For example you can see the approach chart and the corresponding harbor detail chart both together on the same screen.<br /><br />• You can create, import, edit, export, and navigate both on routes based on a recorded or imported path, and on routes based on a series of waypoints.<br /><br />• iSailGPS&#39; s code size is kept very small by efficient programming so in an emergency, you can download it easily even over a weak cell connection.<br /><br />• Check the App Privacy section. We don&#39;t know who you are when you are using iSailGPS. We never send your current location or your recorded track to our servers. Hence we cannot and don&#39;t use your location data. We cannot and don&#39;t provide your location data to anyone else. Many other mapping apps do profit from using your location data in ways that do not keep it private.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been using this app for about a year and I’m extremely happy with it. I can set waypoints and routes right on the app just like I would on a chart. Then follow the route, and even reverse it on my iPad or iPhone. I can send a route from my iPad to my iPhone and it brings the waypoints with it. You can take a screenshot of the route and print it out, so you can check off each waypoint as you pass it. They even added the latitude and longitude of each waypoint to the route screen. They’re very responsive and I highly recommend this app.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Any of the negative reviews, and there are only a few, cleary just downloaded the app and didn’t bother to learn it.  This app is amazing!  I do wish I could figure out how to download additional waypoint icons though.  Anchorage, bouy, ramp, hoist, pump out, etc.  it may be possible but I can’t figure out.  Still tho, great map.  One tip, when creating waypoints, make sure to use in insets or zoom way in because, initially, when I was creating them, I learned that they were way off!</p>

This version improves the human interface layout on the new iPad mini.\n\nOnly on older devices running iOS 9, chart downloads quit working on 9/30/21 due to an expiring html security certificate.

You get information such as Estimated Time of Arrival, current bearing and heading, and remaining distance to your intermediate and final destinations.\n\n• You don't just see individual charts. Whenever the map projection is compatible (which it is most cases), you can see adjacent charts with their margins removed stitched together seamlessly, even when the chart scales are different. For example you can see the approach chart and the corresponding harbor detail chart both together on the same screen.\n\n• You can create, import, edit, export, and navigate both on routes based on a recorded or imported path, and on routes based on a series of waypoints.\n\n• iSailGPS' s code size is kept very small by efficient programming so in an emergency, you can download it easily even over a weak cell connection.\n\n• Check the App Privacy section.

You get information such as Estimated Time of Arrival, current bearing and heading, and remaining distance to your intermediate and final destinations.\n\n• You don't just see individual charts. Whenever the map projection is compatible (which it is most cases), you can see adjacent charts with their margins removed stitched together seamlessly, even when the chart scales are different. For example you can see the approach chart and the corresponding harbor detail chart both together on the same screen.\n\n• You can create, import, edit, export, and navigate both on routes based on a recorded or imported path, and on routes based on a series of waypoints.\n\n• iSailGPS' s code size is kept very small by efficient programming so in an emergency, you can download it easily even over a weak cell connection.\n\n• Check the App Privacy section.

VECTOR CHARTS\n\nThe National Oceanic \u0026 Atmospheric Administration provides both RNC (raster) \u0026 ENC (vector) charts.\n\nThe great advantage of the high resolution RNC charts used by iSailGPS is the high level of detail produced by professional cartographers that is unobtainable on any vector-based chart. ENC Vector Charts only show a coastline, water depth, navigation aids \u0026 minimal details.\n\nThese RNC Charts differ from vector charts in that each chart covers a specific area, just as paper nautical charts do. Switches automatically to a new chart when your boat leaves the area covered by the previous chart. For most locations, there are multiple charts at different scales with different levels of detail \u0026 areas of coverage.\n\nPaper charts can have multiple panels, each showing a different area or scale. Each digital panel is individually displayed by iSailGPS with a north-up orientation.\n\nOther more expensive marine software uses these same RNC charts. iSail GPS is priced to make it readily available to all boating enthusiasts.\n\nDEVICE REQUIREMENTS\n\nNo device requires a cellular data plan to use iSailGPS.\n\nWiFi+cellular iPad 2 or later, \u0026 iPhone 4S or later support full navigation.\n\niPad 2 or later with WiFi-only, \u0026 iPod touch (5th gen or later) require an iOS-compatible external GPS receiver to show your location on the water and to record tracks. View charts using the iOS device alone.\n\n\nWinner of the Practical Sailor Editors’ Choice Award.\n\nSailing becomes safer and more fun with iSailGPS!"},"websiteUrl":"http://iSailGPS.com","offers":[{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=7990\u0026salableAdamId=433950540\u0026pricingParameters=STDQ\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=844520962","type":"buy","priceFormatted":"$7.99","price":7.99,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":13952000}]},{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=0\u0026salableAdamId=433950540\u0026pricingParameters=SWUPD\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=844520962","type":"update","priceFormatted":"$0.00","price":0,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":13952000}]}]},"relationships":{"artwork":{"data":{"type":"image","id":"ember93520108"}}}}]},"relatedEditorialItems":{"data":[]},"reviews":{"data":[{"id":"5752866712","type":"media/review"},{"id":"3737684768","type":"media/review"},{"id":"6824029844","type":"media/review"},{"id":"7880770654","type":"media/review"},{"id":"7194237011","type":"media/review"},{"id":"4344336527","type":"media/review"},{"id":"1993656909","type":"media/review"},{"id":"3878323391","type":"media/review"},{"id":"7967504422","type":"media/review"},{"id":"2407722983","type":"media/review"}],"meta":{"next":"/v1/catalog/us/apps/433950540/reviews?l=en-US\u0026offset=10"}},"topInApps":{"data":[]},"ipadScreenshots":{"data":[{"id":"ember93520098","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520099","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520100","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520101","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520102","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520103","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520104","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520105","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520106","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520107","type":"image"}]},"iphoneScreenshots":{"data":[{"id":"ember93520090","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520091","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520092","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520093","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520094","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520095","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520096","type":"image"},{"id":"ember93520097","type":"image"}]},"genres":{"data":[{"id":"6010","type":"media/genre"},{"id":"6003","type":"media/genre"}]}}},"included":[{"id":"5752866712","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-02T21:59:36Z","rating":4,"review":"I have to give 4stars to put my review in as 1 star gets rejected!!!\nDon’t buy this app, if you can’t draw a straight line on a chart for way points then you may need this.

VECTOR CHARTS\n\nThe National Oceanic \u0026 Atmospheric Administration provides both RNC (raster) \u0026 ENC (vector) charts.\n\nThe great advantage of the high resolution RNC charts used by iSailGPS is the high level of detail produced by professional cartographers that is unobtainable on any vector-based chart. ENC Vector Charts only show a coastline, water depth, navigation aids \u0026 minimal details.\n\nThese RNC Charts differ from vector charts in that each chart covers a specific area, just as paper nautical charts do. Switches automatically to a new chart when your boat leaves the area covered by the previous chart. For most locations, there are multiple charts at different scales with different levels of detail \u0026 areas of coverage.\n\nPaper charts can have multiple panels, each showing a different area or scale. Each digital panel is individually displayed by iSailGPS with a north-up orientation.\n\nOther more expensive marine software uses these same RNC charts. iSail GPS is priced to make it readily available to all boating enthusiasts.\n\nDEVICE REQUIREMENTS\n\nNo device requires a cellular data plan to use iSailGPS.\n\nWiFi+cellular iPad 2 or later, \u0026 iPhone 4S or later support full navigation.\n\niPad 2 or later with WiFi-only, \u0026 iPod touch (5th gen or later) require an iOS-compatible external GPS receiver to show your location on the water and to record tracks.
