Absolutely love it!” -- @brennandunn\n \n“I never, ever, ever thought I’d see this, and yet here it is: CREDIT CARD BEAST DEFEATED! Props to @YNAB which helped me get it done!” -- @taber\n \n“3 years ago I started with YNAB, the goal was paying off all my debt. With YNAB, I was able to double the goal! Bye, financial stress!” -- @HancinGaming\n \n“I just don’t know what I’d do without YNAB. I’ve never been so financially aware in my life.” -- @janejoneslives\n \n“I’ve been using YNAB for over 2 years, and in 23 days my fiance and I will be paying for our wedding without any loans because of YNAB. Thank you!” -- @Thai_Jonny\n \nYou’ve Never Budgeted Like This Before\nTired of trying and failing to manage your expenses? Suffering from budget burnout? We get it. But YNAB is different—because it actually works. Our powerful combination of a proven method plus our easy-to-use app will change the way you think—and do—money for the better. You’ll finally stop stressing about finances, pay off debt, build wealth, and start living life on your terms.\n \nA Proven Method—YNAB’s Four Rules\nRule One: Give Every Dollar A Job | You’re the boss. The drill Sergeant. The maestro. When you earn money, you prioritize how you’ll use it, and then simply follow your plan.\n \nRule Two: Embrace Your True Expenses | Make your money boring. Did the car break down? No big deal. Are the holidays coming? You’ve got a Santa-sized pile of money stashed away. No credit card required.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Most budget programs are set it and forget it. Which is the problem: once you set it, you forget it and you drift away from your spending plan.  The beauty of YNAB is that it is flexible and dynamic, and allows you to adjust your spending plan as you need to. I found the program itself is well designed, reliable, and easy to use. The only issues I’ve had were with banks making it hard to set up connectivity. But YNAB did a good job of communicating how they were working to resolve the issues.  In the beginning it does take a few hours to set up categories and get banks connected,  mainly because it is so customizable, but once it is set up it is virtually effortless to maintain. Do watch the tutorials first on how to set it up.  But then  I spend 1 to 3 minutes each morning reviewing the previous days expenditures, and maybe 10 minutes a month reconciling my accounts. It shows monthly and quarterly reports so I can see trends over time. The only tricky bit is understanding how YNAB budgets your credit card purchases. That is not intuitive the way the rest of the program is. But they produce tutorials that explain it well. The web platform is easiest to use for setting up your categories, and for reconciliation. But the phone app is essential for quickly checking your remaining budgets on the go, especially as you get close to your next payday. I highly recommend it for those who want to be in charge of their spending habits.</p>

    The iPad app is way to kiddy

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The app/methodology/paradigm(s) have really revolutionized the way I approach my own finances and i cannot recommend it enough from that regard as a service &amp; function. I have budgeted myself for well over a decade and have done alright, but always felt there was some missing piece or rather a “hole” that seemed to be getting in my way. This app/way of tagging and budgeting really helped me see in a very adult way, the ways in which I was failing to connect some financial dots and keep myself from doing as well as I should have been; it made sense after I really pressed myself to drop my bad thinking that I had developed to try and work around the natural holes in a standard budget logic.<br /><br />Having said all of that, I find myself using my iPad Pro to access the web client, as the app itself is so kiddy and limited that it makes it actually harder to digest the information presented and make the most sense of it. So much information but it’s all so “big” that you can’t see the big picture, almost simply because the text and forms are so LARGE. Really the app could be and needs to be as feature-rich and dense as the web app; basically take the web app and adapt it to be touch targets and color coded like the app is. It could be so much BETTER than the web interface with all the screen real estate on the iPad and the easy entry and basic structure they have in place for it already. I really look forward to the iPad app “growing up.”</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve used YNAB since I was a broke college student, and it’s helped me keep my financial life on track despite barely breaking the poverty line for my first few years out of school. I have never struggled to make rent or pay for my necessities, and I’ve stayed free of consumer debt. Because of YNAB I have been able to carefully weigh any debt I did take on (training for a career switch, a car) and pay it down without any stress. I clung stubbornly to the desktop app until I convinced my partner to start using it, and saw how far the web/mobile app had come, at which point I promptly switched over. I have a thing about app subscriptions (hate ‘em), but the YNAB team is consistently rolling out improvements and features, all of which have been rock solid and helped me plan for my financial future even better. It’s one of the rare cases where I get enough value from the service that I’m not only willing but HAPPY to pay to help the company grow. I could not recommend this app more highly. If you’ve ever struggled to save money or pay down debt, if you regularly get clobbered by predictable but irregular payments (6 month insurance premiums, replacing your computer/phone/car), if you need more accountability to make sure you’re spending your money in line with your values, there is nothing better on the market for helping you get there.</p>

can be used to navigate between categories when using an external keyboard.\n• We now support the iOS ‘Differentiate Without Color’ option, making it easier for budgeters who’ve enabled that setting to differentiate underfunded or overspent available balances.\n• Voiceover labels for editing transactions have been improved to increase clarity.\n• Visual highlighting and haptic feedback for keypad key presses have both been improved.\n• With this release we’re also continuing to improve app launch and Budget tab performance. \n\nBug fixes\n• Adding a transaction by long pressing on the app icon

You should notice that some interactions run much faster, e.g. processing new transactions, switching months in the budget, or reconciling accounts.\n• The app should start faster.\n• The transaction editing toolbar and flag submenu got a refresh.\n• Added a subtle haptic feedback when reordering category groups.\n\nBug fixes\n• Tapping on a help prompt will now display the correct help page.\n• Fixed a bug where Pull to Refresh kept on spinning and stopped working.\n• Fixed an issue where the target overview text wouldn’t show on iPad.\n• Fixed a display issue with target descriptions when editing the target type for a Category.\n• Fixed reordering categories between sections that would position the category in the wrong place.\n• Fixed an issue where hiding a category could leave it on the Budget list.\n• Fixed some visual glitches:\n  ◦ Subtle visual fix on the background of Edit Account screen.\n  ◦ Reduced spacing on the Move Money screen on iPad.\n  ◦ Fixed a subtle layout issue with dividers on large Widgets.\n  ◦ Fixed a display issue with hidden categories amount while hiding categories.\n  ◦ Fixed a small UI inconsistency that would say “Show Progress Bars” while they were already shown.\n• Fixed an issue where category rows would shift when adjusting the assigned amount on smaller devices or while using Display Zoom.\n• Fixed a crash when inserting categories on the budget.\n• Fixed a crash when adding a category to a large group.\n• Fixed a glitch in the Category Overview screen title that would bug on iOS 13  when the category had an emoji in its name.","releaseDate":"2021-09-07"},{"versionDisplay":"3.0.1","releaseNotes":"What’s new in v3.0.1\nWe’re excited to bring you a post-big-release release! We have improvements and bug fixes for you today.\n\nImprovements\n• Two major accessibility wins:\n  ◦ We made many improvements to VoiceOver interactions.\n  ◦ We changed our background colors so that the Increase Contrast accessibility setting will now apply to the YNAB app and actually increase the contrast.\n• We darkened the font color to increase contrast.\n• We take better advantage of the big iPad screen during reconciliation.\n• If you’re using iOS 14, you can now select transaction and target dates from a calendar.\n\nBug fixes\n• Fixed an issue where data from a previously-loaded budget was showing up after log in.\n• Some situations caused the app to crash when adding categories or category groups. Those are fixed.\n• Color contrast has been tweaked slightly to improve legibility and scannability.\n• If you use the category context menu to open the activity screen and then select transactions for bulk editing, we’ll now show you the toolbar (like you’d expect).\n• Some budget changes weren’t being saved when navigating to another screen from the budget list. Now everything saves as it should.\n• If you’re saving a transaction without a category, tapping “Set Category” now takes you to the category list (again, like you’d expect).\n• Fixed a few layout issues with the split transaction editor on iPad.\n• Fixed some errors that popped up when restoring from a backup that had an older version of YNAB.","releaseDate":"2021-08-03"},{"versionDisplay":"3.0","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v3.0\nAs the version number indicates, this is a big one!\n\nThe 3.0 update includes powerful new features and some key terminology updates, including:\n• To Be Budgeted is now Ready to Assign; your dollars are now assigned in your budget.\n• Category “goals” are now called targets.\n• Auto-Assign is a new way to fund your targets and scheduled transactions with only a few quick taps.\n• You can now harness the power of Progress Bars on mobile! They’re off by default, and can be turned on and off as needed.\n• Editing all of your budget categories and targets is quicker and easier thanks to a new dedicated mode.\n• Less relevant to our seasoned beta testers, but the first time user experience has officially been transformed (goodbye infamous YNAB learning curve!)\n\n5,000 pull requests later, we’re pretty excited about this one and we think you will be too!","releaseDate":"2021-07-13"},{"versionDisplay":"2.16.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.16.1\n\nToday we have some bug fixes for you! \n• Recent Moves now displays longer category names, for all you folks with creative category naming skills.\n• Long memos now display correctly if you open an existing transaction with one.\n• In some cases, we wouldn’t let you know that transactions were hidden after you reconciled for the first time. That’s fixed now.\n• We fixed a bug that caused YNAB to crash when opening the account menu on iPad while running iOS 13.\n• If you’re adding a transfer to a split transaction, we’ll now only tell you that you don’t have any other accounts to transfer to if you actually don’t have other accounts to transfer to.\n• And when you’re adding that transfer to your split transaction, we’ll display accounts in the same order as your Accounts tab.\n• Imported transactions won’t create transfers to closed accounts anymore, which should better match reality.","releaseDate":"2021-06-03"},{"versionDisplay":"2.16","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.16\n\nImprovements\n\n• The Money Moves web feature has arrived on mobile!\n  ◦ Recent Moves: View a 34-day feed of your most recent moves, accessed from the More menu at the top of your budget. \n  ◦ Category Moves: Want to dig into a specific category? Look for the history icon on your category details screen—you’ll be able to view each month’s budgeting and moves for up to three past months, and any future months. iPad users, please note that Category Moves are only accessible via the Recent Moves panel. (i.e. if you tap on a blue category from Recent Moves.)\n\n• Ever wished you could duplicate your daily coffee or transit transaction for fast and easy entry? Now you can! Just select a transaction and choose the new \"Duplicate\" option from the More menu in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen. \n\n• Sometimes, payees are imported with extraneous text such that it's hard to tell what they actually refer to. In this release we're adding information about what we call the \"source payee\" to each imported transaction. This allows you to see how a transaction was originally recorded at your bank before our direct import partner made any attempt to clean or simplify it. \n\n• Rejoice, for you can now bulk edit transaction flags!\n\n• Account balance out of sync between YNAB and your financial institution? You can now adjust account balances in-app—a manual adjustment transaction will automatically be created. \n\n• Account notes are now both viewable and editable. It’s a whole new world!\n\n• You can now copy and paste transaction amounts into and out of YNAB. No more keeping the total of your latest online shopping adventure in your head while you navigate to YNAB. \n\n• The icons for cleared and uncleared transactions are now easier to distinguish.\n\n• We added a few shortcuts to speed things up when using an iPad with an external keyboard.  Cmd+A selects all transactions, A approves the selected transactions, C clears/unclears the selected transactions, M matches the selected transactions, Backspace deletes the selected transactions, Cmd+N creates a new transaction, and Escape will end account reordering, leave transaction selection mode, and close a variety of other modals. See the full list of iPad shortcuts at any time by pressing and holding down the Cmd key.\n\n• We now (again) autofill linked account nicknames based on the information we receive from our direct import providers. \n\nBug fixes\n\n• The transaction list doesn’t lose its scroll position anymore after editing transactions further down the list.\n• The app can no longer be tricked into not selecting a payee by double-tapping the payee really fast.\n• A rare crash should no longer occur when trying to send a video in support chat. We fixed a background sync issue - now the widget data updates when the app syncs in the background.\n• Finally, we fixed an issue where the widgets wouldn’t display orange balance numbers if, for example, a goal wasn’t met on a category.","releaseDate":"2021-05-05"},{"versionDisplay":"2.15.2","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.15.2\n\nWe’re adding support for the improved category deletions to our mobile app, helping you quickly reassign all transactions and budgeted amounts to the category of your choice when you delete a category.\nWe also fixed a bug which would make it difficult or impossible to select the bottom most transaction in the account view.","releaseDate":"2021-03-18"},{"versionDisplay":"2.15.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.15.1\nToday’s release includes some infrastructure improvements that fall under the category of “nothing to see here.” But also some bug-fixes that fall under “you might have seen these”.

Bulk enter to your heart’s content.\n\nBug fixes\n• We fixed an issue where, under some circumstances, you might see the category balance for the current month rather than the affected month when choosing the category for, and saving,  past transactions. No, we are not warping the space-time continuum (yet).\n• We fixed a bug on iOS 14 where tapping the “spent” amount on iPad would not show the category activity. You’ll see it now, never fear.\n• In the past, occasionally the Overspent Categories banner on iPad wouldn’t show the correct number of overspent categories. That was infuriating, and is now fixed.","releaseDate":"2020-11-23"},{"versionDisplay":"2.14","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.14\n\n• Improvements\nIn this release, we’ve revamped the help section!

Previously, we only showed an alert icon and messaging saying: \"Transaction Import Failed, Resolve errors to retry.\" We now break this error status down into more useful messages such as \"Delayed, This issue usually resolves itself\", \"Reauthorize, To continue importing transactions\", \"Blocked, Learn more\", and a few others.\n• We've now made it possible to leave the transaction editor by swiping down on its title bar in all cases.\n\nBug fixes\n• We fixed a couple of cosmetic issues when swiping left on transactions on iOS 12.","releaseDate":"2020-08-17"},{"versionDisplay":"2.13.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.13.1\n\nWe’ve pushed out a handful of bug-fixes just in time for Summer! Maybe “handful” isn’t the right measurement. Maybe it is. Either way, they’re big hands, because they also did some meaningful behind-the-scenes infrastructural work as well. I feel weird that we’re still talking about hands now. Anyway, here are just a few of the bug-fixes that we did for this release:\n\nBug Fixes\n• We’ve fixed a bug that sometimes sent users to the budget switcher when starting the app, even though a budget was open when they last left the app. That’s like when you accidentally pull out your bookmark from the book you’re reading, which is super frustrating...which is why I dog-ear my pages...I know...I’M A MONSTER!!!\n• We’ve fixed a bug where the app would sometimes crash while starting up. Safety first! No one likes crashing.\n• We’ve fixed a bug where uploading an image in the support chat could sometimes crash the app. Yeah...that sounds like the opposite of how awesome our Support team is. “Oh...you need help with your budget? [image uploading]...and...oh...looks like YNAB crashed, and thanks for reaching out.” Fortunately, this is all fixed.","releaseDate":"2020-07-06"},{"versionDisplay":"2.13","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.13\nYou’ve heard of #lifegoals and maybe even #squadgoals, but what about #goalgoals?! Well, in this latest release, YNAB has fulfilled everyone’s #goalgoals by taking goals in YNAB to the next level. When setting goals in YNAB you’ll now have quite a few more options to help you accomplish all of your #moneygoals.\n\nImprovements\n[extreme Andrés Cantor voice] GoooooooooOOOOOOOOaaaaaaAAAAAlllllllllLLLLs\n• We added new “goal type selection” for increased clarity on which type of goal to use and when.\n• You can now set a target day of the month for Monthly goals.\n• There is also now a Weekly goal option where you can target a day of the week.\n• Lastly, we’ve also extended the By Date goals to allow selecting an exact target date. You can also (optionally) repeat goals every n months/years. And “n” in this case stands for number...I think...or maybe just months that start with “n”...November? Napril? Hmmm....\n------------------\n• We've now made it possible to collapse all scheduled transactions so you can decide whether you want to see them in your accounts or not. I wish I could literally and existentially just collapse my scheduled auto insurance bills.\n• You thought we were done talking about goals, didn’t you. Nope! YNAB will now show more information about how budgeting a negative amount affects a Target Balance By Date goal.\n• We changed the behavior for configuring notifications to always be consistent. You can now always configure your notifications from the Settings menu.\n\nBug fixes\n• This was just a small tweak, but now all transactions align vertically perfectly in the Accounts tab...or at least they’re more perfect...perfecter?\n• We fixed a rare crash that happened when going into split screen multitasking on iPad while reordering accounts. Listen, you multitasking YNABers, we get it. You want to do everything at once and we salute you, but give us time to catch up to your prolificness!\n• If you enabled larger accessibility text sizes in your iOS Settings, the payee wouldn't show in the transaction editor, but we fixed this particular issue.","releaseDate":"2020-06-17"},{"versionDisplay":"2.12.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.12.1\nOnce again, our developers have put on their bug-fixing pants (and pantsuits) to go-a-bug-wranglin’. And you’re all like, “why do you need to wear specific pants to fix bugs?” Hey, maybe don’t worry about how the bug-fixing sausage is made or how we just freely mix all sorts of metaphors together all willy-nilly. Just check out these sweet, sweet results:\n\n- Bug fixes\n• In some cases, the Create Goal button in the category details wouldn’t show up due to specific layout constraints. If it wasn’t showing up for you, it should now after this release.\n\n• Nearby payees can now be manually removed again without having to forget their location...or without having to choose to “forget their location.” Who among us wants to remember going to the DMV?\n\n• We fixed a rare issue where you could sometimes end up in an empty budget state on your phone while changing your password on web at the same time. No, this wasn’t an experimental Rule 5 - Transport Your Budget To An Alternate Dimension bit of code we were testing out. That hasn’t been released yet.\n\n• Fixed an edge case that would allow a transfer payee to get a geo location. For online banks that was probably extra creepy (your bank is calling from inside your house???) but it’s been fixed now!\n\n• We fixed a bug where the username and password input fields would be hidden behind the keyboard after returning to the app during login. Probably the most boring game of hide and seek ever, but that shouldn’t happen anymore.\n\n• On the iPhone SE, we fixed an issue where the notes field in the transaction editor would be hidden by the keyboard. Man. That keyboard is cramping our style. What are you trying to hide, keyboard?!\n\n• Fixed a rare crash when using Quick Budget. Um...that wasn’t what we meant by “Quick Budget.”\n\n• As part of our continued effort to make the web/mobile experiences more cohesive, we updated the icon for \"Account Settings\" to match what we have on web. Where we used to have a little \"settings panel\" icon, we now have a little \"user\" icon.","releaseDate":"2020-04-16"},{"versionDisplay":"2.12","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.12\nYou've signed in with a password and you may have signed in with Google, but I don't think you've truly lived until you've signed in with Apple. And now, with this release, you can (sign in with Apple)! Just think of how convenient it will be to not have to remember your password every time you go into YNAB to give dollars jobs. The future has truly arrived...or, at least, this is a nice-to-have feature for all of you die hard Apple fans...are we calling you AppleHeads™? I am now. We've also pushed some nice bug-fixes for all of you hard core (I know what I did there) AppleHeads™:\n\nImprovements\n• When you go to delete a category with transactions, we will now show you a warning explaining the risks and offer to hide the categories instead. I believe it was either Sir Winston Churchill or maybe Spiderman’s uncle who said, \"with great power comes great responsibility\"...but also, it doesn't hurt to throw in a courtesy warning modal with that power too.\n\nBug fixes\n• Fixed an iPad crash in iOS 12 when tapping the \"More\" menu button while editing transactions...and you thought we meant MORE crashes. Nope! \n• Fixed a crash that happened after doing a Fresh Start. Hopefully now, though, only your money stress levels will crash after doing a Fresh Start to go out there and get it with your financial goals. You can do this!...especially now that the app isn't crashing.\n• Fixed an issue where the To Be Budgeted banner on iPad would sometimes show as green when the amount was 0.\n• Fixed an issue where the Overspent Categories banner sometimes displayed a count of 0. This was a bug and NOT a Minority Report-style \"Precog\" feature where we tell you that you have overspent categories before you have them. Whew.\n• Fixed the toolbar layout for approving or categorizing transactions.\n• Fixed an issue where the scroll indicator never reached the bottom of the table on the Budget, Accounts and Transaction screens\n\nUntil next time, AppleHeads™...","releaseDate":"2020-03-19"},{"versionDisplay":"2.11.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.11.1\nSo, it looks like all of our iOS developers woke up on January 1st and made a New Year's resolution to completely eradicate all bugs and possibly even the memory of bugs existing as a thing. I don't know if maybe they watched A Bug's Life or Antz or that Jerry Seinfeld movie with bees, and just said, \"who do these guys even think they are with their legs and wings, swimming in raindrops and ruining picnics?!!!\" But then, instead of taking out actual bugs, they just went ham on getting rid of a ton of bugs for this release. Whatever the case may be, we fixed a TON of bugs:\n\n• Fixed a rare issue where the app could get stuck loading on launch...just like how real bugs sometimes get stuck loading up on lunch.\n• On the iPad, we fixed some cases where the budget tab would show a different month after switching back to the app or resizing it. To be clear, a different \"month\" was showing up, not a different \"moth.\" Moths are terrifying the way they dive bomb your lantern when you're camping at night. Sorry, we’ll stop talking about real bugs now.\n• We made it so the actions on the transaction toolbar are now all accessible in all multitasking modes and orientations. BTW, Multitasking is new. Now it’s new and improved!\n• Fixed a bug where sometimes subcategories were not able to be reordered until after an app restart. Not ideal, but now that restart shouldn’t be necessary!\n• Replaced \"Add Transaction\" with \"Record Payment\" in context menus for debt categories. This wasn’t just a text swap. There is now an appropriate behavior that happens as well, such as the cursor going to the outflow field.\n• Fixed a bug where if you had a By Date goal and the target date had already passed, we weren't letting you save changes to a category! Whoops! Fixed now.\n• Changed the flow for covering overspending on iPad using the red pill. Now it goes straight to a filtered list of categories to cover the overspending with. Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with Keanu Reeves choosing to leave the Matrix to become a grown-up man fetus who gets flushed down a robot toilet...sounds maybe a little strange out-of-context...\n• Cleaned up icons, simplified color schemes and did some minor animation fixes. Nothing major here, but it will pave the way for possible improvements to colors, icons and animations in the future.\n• Fixed the top of the empty state text being cut off in the payee selection screen. Was the full state half empty, or was the empty state half full? Now, we’ll never know.\n• Fixed an issue where the nearby payee was not defaulted when creating a new transaction before the device location is loaded. But let’s be honest, it’s usually Amazon, Target or Costco #AmIRight?\n• Previously, when tapping and holding on a section header, the context menu came up for the first cell in the section, making it difficult to reorder groups. This prevented context menus from popping up on budget section headers and also on all cells while editing. But we fixed this.\n• Fixed a crash when unmatching transactions on iPad.\n• Fixed a rare crash when reordering category groups...and hey, no one likes crashes, except I remember that movie, “Crash” winning best picture or something. Also, that Dave Matthews song was OK. Other than that, though, crashes are universally not liked.","releaseDate":"2020-02-10"},{"versionDisplay":"2.11","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.11\n2020. We're here. THE FUTURE!!!! And we are so ready for 2020 with this release. In honor of basically all of us now being in Bladerunner (the Harrison Ford one...well, maybe the Ryan Gosling one...who knows?) this new version of YNAB supports screen rotation and split-view/slide-over multitasking on iPad. I know. We're pretty much just all cyborgs at this point. Talk about a futuristic feature: with multitasking, you can have YNAB open on one side of your iPad and have Amazon open on the other side, looking at all of your purchases trying to figure out what that $5.49 charge was...socks? A single light bulb?...that might explain why the future is so bright...\n\nImprovements\n• When a user creates a split transaction, but then only enters a single category, we used to just send over the category information into a flattened single transaction. With this release, we now preserve all data from that split transaction (amount and memo) and bring it over to the single parent transaction. Split it and forget it is what we like to say...nope...that's not a thing.\n\nBug fixes\n• We did a tweak to fix a bug where keypad button presses didn't always register if users moved their fingers slightly while tapping a button. Look, we're not saying you're a sloppy typer. We've all been over-excited to enter in a vacation savings goal or a transaction for a gift for a friend. Either way, you're covered now.\n• We fixed a few cases of horizontal scrolling and/or cutoff side margins on iPad popovers where the arrow is on the right or left.\n• We also fixed an issue where the bottom of the hidden categories list gets cut off. We said \"hidden,\" not cut in half!!!\n• Raise your hand if you hate unexpected crashes...oh, literally everyone hates this...we do too. So, we fixed an issue that was causing crashes when the app was attempting to present an action sheet on the transaction list popover. Whew. We're so glad that everyone raised their hands there. Crashes are the worst.","releaseDate":"2020-01-13"},{"versionDisplay":"2.10.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.10.1\n\nWhat’s that smell? Is it frankincense? Lutefisk? Nope! It’s a whole bunch of yuletide bug-fixes and improvements that we’ve dropped just in time for the Holidays:\n\n• We’ve improved our integration with password managers. In particular, we now use iCloud key sharing, if you want to share credentials between the web and mobile app. Oh, what fun it is to login to YNAB without having to remember your password in a one-horse open (but secure) sleigh.\n• We improved the transaction details area, so that it no longer does any annoying horizontal scrolling. Hark! The horizontal angel of scrolling will no longer sing! Also, we don’t use the word “hark” enough. Let’s make that a thing.\n• Hark!...actually more like, “dark!” We fixed the text color for matched transactions that looked a little blurry in Dark Mode. “Was that letter an L or an I?” Now, you’ll know that there was “No L, Noooo L, No L, Noooooo LL.” I’ll see myself out.\n• We fixed an issue that involved the timing for when we ask for biometric authentication again. What more can we do? Baby, all we want for Christmas is...proper biometric authentication timing.\n• Alright, so remember how the matched transaction text was blurry for Dark Mode and then we fixed it? Well, our flag images were also a little blurry as well. And we’ve now fixed those flag images to be nice and crisp...like a winter day...like a winter wonderland, even?\n• There was an issue when using voiceover for frequency selection in the Repeat field. But we fixed it, and now things can be said many times, many ways…\n• We made the transaction screen button animations smoother. And by that, I mean we made them so they actually animate now. Hallelujah!\n\nAnd, with that, I know you’re tired of our Holiday-themed release notes, so we’ll just end by wishing you a Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and a Happy New Year from all of us at YNAB!","releaseDate":"2019-12-11"},{"versionDisplay":"2.10","releaseNotes":"You know how the old saying goes: the darker the mode, the sweeter the budgeting. That's totally not a thing anyone has ever said, but perhaps it will be? With this release, we've gone dark. Yep. We added Dark Mode to your favorite budgeting app. Some of you might be wondering if it will still be as satisfying to move money and crush debt in the dark...we think it will be! Don't be afraid of the dark! Give YNAB's new Dark Mode a try! And when you're ready to turn the light back on, check out some of the other bug fixes and improvements that we've made in this release:\n\nWhat’s new\n• Dark Mode - I can't stress enough how deliciously dark YNAB is now. It's at least 100% darker than our normal mode.\n• iOS 13 Context Menus - We've taken advantage of this helpful, new iOS 13 feature. Now you can do literally dozens of contextually appropriate actions in the budget view, account view and transaction lists. These menus will save you time by doing all sorts of things like pre-populating the appropriate category when adding transaction or giving you the ability to add or edit goals in the contextually appropriate category.\n\nBug fixes\n• We fixed a budget reorder issue...well, actually it was two issues. When reordering the top budget group in a budget table, the other budget views would get pushed all the way down. Even worse than that, though, was if you only had two budget groups, the reordering would appear to work, but upon refreshing the table, it would revert back to the order it was in. We fixed these issues and order (or reorder) has been restored to the universe...er, your budget.\n• In iOS 13, there was a cursor issue when YNABers were going in to edit a budget category. You would have to delete the category name in order to get the cursor to move from the beginning of the text field. We went ahead and fixed that, so that should be an improvement upon a cursory reassessment of your budget categories...is that what 'cursory' means?\n• We recently added the search feature to our iOS app, and it's pretty great. But also, there was a small issue...when users were tapping the \"Cancel\" button to cancel their search, the \"Cancel\" button wasn't going away. It was overstaying its welcome. Well, \"Cancel\" button, I hate to tell you this, but after you've been tapped, that's really all that we need from you. You're great. We love what you do, but when you cancel something, you really just need to go away until we need you again. Oh, also, we didn't just tell the \"Cancel\" button to go away. We actually fixed the issue.\n• We were able to fix an issue where the bottom tab bar would disappear in some cases when YNABers were moving money or editing transactions. We've got to give a huge shout out to our new mobile developer, Itai, on a lot of these fixes. He came into a world where we've got buttons not disappearing when they should and tab bars disappearing when they shouldn't and he totally wrangled these disappearing/reappearing problem children and put them back in line.

Which is the problem: once you set it, you forget it and you drift away from your spending plan.  The beauty of YNAB is that it is flexible and dynamic, and allows you to adjust your spending plan as you need to. I found the program itself is well designed, reliable, and easy to use. The only issues I’ve had were with banks making it hard to set up connectivity. But YNAB did a good job of communicating how they were working to resolve the issues.  In the beginning it does take a few hours to set up categories and get banks connected,  mainly because it is so customizable, but once it is set up it is virtually effortless to maintain. Do watch the tutorials first on how to set it up.  But then  I spend 1 to 3 minutes each morning reviewing the previous days expenditures, and maybe 10 minutes a month reconciling my accounts. It shows monthly and quarterly reports so I can see trends over time. The only tricky bit is understanding how YNAB budgets your credit card purchases. That is not intuitive the way the rest of the program is. But they produce tutorials that explain it well. The web platform is easiest to use for setting up your categories, and for reconciliation. But the phone app is essential for quickly checking your remaining budgets on the go, especially as you get close to your next payday. I highly recommend it for those who want to be in charge of their spending habits.","title":"Excellent cash flow management tool","userName":"CatherineB58"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3714518356","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-01-31T01:55:43Z","rating":5,"review":"The app/methodology/paradigm(s) have really revolutionized the way I approach my own finances and i cannot recommend it enough from that regard as a service \u0026 function. I have budgeted myself for well over a decade and have done alright, but always felt there was some missing piece or rather a “hole” that seemed to be getting in my way. This app/way of tagging and budgeting really helped me see in a very adult way, the ways in which I was failing to connect some financial dots and keep myself from doing as well as I should have been; it made sense after I really pressed myself to drop my bad thinking that I had developed to try and work around the natural holes in a standard budget logic.\n\nHaving said all of that, I find myself using my iPad Pro to access the web client, as the app itself is so kiddy and limited that it makes it actually harder to digest the information presented and make the most sense of it. So much information but it’s all so “big” that you can’t see the big picture, almost simply because the text and forms are so LARGE. Really the app could be and needs to be as feature-rich and dense as the web app; basically take the web app and adapt it to be touch targets and color coded like the app is. It could be so much BETTER than the web interface with all the screen real estate on the iPad and the easy entry and basic structure they have in place for it already. I really look forward to the iPad app “growing up.”","title":"The iPad app is way to kiddy","userName":"Randombobarc"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6503746160","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-05T16:49:40Z","rating":5,"review":"I’ve used YNAB since I was a broke college student, and it’s helped me keep my financial life on track despite barely breaking the poverty line for my first few years out of school. I have never struggled to make rent or pay for my necessities, and I’ve stayed free of consumer debt. Because of YNAB I have been able to carefully weigh any debt I did take on (training for a career switch, a car) and pay it down without any stress. I clung stubbornly to the desktop app until I convinced my partner to start using it, and saw how far the web/mobile app had come, at which point I promptly switched over. I have a thing about app subscriptions (hate ‘em), but the YNAB team is consistently rolling out improvements and features, all of which have been rock solid and helped me plan for my financial future even better. It’s one of the rare cases where I get enough value from the service that I’m not only willing but HAPPY to pay to help the company grow. I could not recommend this app more highly. If you’ve ever struggled to save money or pay down debt, if you regularly get clobbered by predictable but irregular payments (6 month insurance premiums, replacing your computer/phone/car), if you need more accountability to make sure you’re spending your money in line with your values, there is nothing better on the market for helping you get there.","title":"Stable, Essential, Life Changing","userName":"Ula VL"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6957127920","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-05T14:06:03Z","rating":5,"review":"This is one of the best things I have ever done for myself. I have always lived paycheck to paycheck. It’s been very difficult for me to save, and when expenses would pop up, like car repairs, I would have high anxiety. I had tried making a budget for myself before, using various spreadsheets designed for budgeting, but most had me try to figure out what I would bring in in a year and what I would spend in that year. It was something I could never figure out very well or stick to. YNAB starts by only having you budget the money you have right now. Every dollar gets a job. It makes it so much more manageable. In just a short period of six months, I’ve gone from having debt, to a point where that debt is gone and I just reached 30 days of the age of my money, which gives me so much more choice and MUCH less anxiety.\n\nThe other great thing that sets this app apart is the help you receive. There are tons of online training sessions daily, and any time I hit a snag where I wasn’t sure how to handle something, I could get a hold of someone almost immediately who would walk me through the issue I was having. \n\nI would highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to get control of their personal finances and live a bit more at ease day to day.","title":"This app has changed my entire financial way of life","userName":"93Stephen"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6032113532","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-04T01:17:03Z","rating":4,"review":"Update 6/3/20: please for the love of budgets can you create a way to upload files from Dropbox or files within the App? My local bank is not supported for direct link and this is becoming so cumbersome on iPad. I don’t want to have to go to a computer every single time but the process is becoming bogged down to the point of annoyance. \n\nI really love YNAB! It has helped us tremendously with our budget and is easy to use. For me, the app is a bit smoother and simpler to use than the website. Here is my conundrum:  We use a small town bank that does not have direct download, so we have to manually download our transactions. I don’t want to fire up the laptop just to do this, as it doesn’t really take that long. So it goes, sign into bank website, download transactions, sign into YNAB website, which using an iPad means go to YNAB site, choose Request Desktop Site, then login, then import. \nUnderstandably, being it is a small bank, there may be no direct link in the near or distant future. I have no desire to move to another larger bank (there aren’t any close enough) that has direct link. So, I have one request, could we have a way to upload our manual transactions from the app instead of having to go through the website every time? It would make it a tad smoother process on the user end. I still love YNAB and will continue to use it.

Overall, it is a much better implementation of a very similar and useful approach to budgeting— I really like it. Customer support is responsive, the interface is nice, and it nails all the essentials except for one thing— the way it handles reimbursements. I spend money for work costs in one month and am fully reimbursed the next. I never used to have to worry about it and it was useful for making sure I was capturing all my reimbursable expenses.  Whereas with mvelopes I used to be able to carry over that negative balance into the next month, which would resolve when I get paid, ynab forces the balance to zero when the month turns over and moves the debt into my credit card accounts. This in turn forces me to have to allocate my personal funds to cover expenses I know will be reimbursed, or track down where the debt was created and manually allocate the payment to my credit cards. It makes a simple process that should have no impact on my personal budget MUCH more complicated than it needs to be. Ynab says they are working on creating a dedicated reimbursement category to address this issue, and I will be 100% happy with ynab when they do.","title":"A significant upgrade from mvelopes but with a major caveat","userName":"Berrivas"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2112669621","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-01-21T20:18:07Z","rating":5,"review":"App is great, service is great and life changing.

My girlfriend and I (she is more enraged than I am) loved how easy it was to change budgets in the old app! Now We have to go through a very long journey just to change the budget! And I have 3 different budgets (sometimes 4 if I am traveling) I wish there was an easy way to switch between them (while we are at it, the web app could use easier budget switching ..). Also, maybe add in a title somewhere which budget I have opened? A few times I have logged in things in the wrong budget, because I didn’t realize I had the wrong one open\n\n2.

I’m good with finances, but only looked backward at what I was spending, then made reasonable, gut-based decisions about what we could afford.  We had a byzantine suite of accounts with which I wrestled monthly, transfer if from one account to another, writing everything out in tiny writing in a notebook then doing quarterly reports for myself.  That’s to say, I put in a lot of work.  But we didn’t get to the point of having extra money on hand, ever, and carried a fluctuating debt balance, always.  I’m doing YNAB in a dedicated fashion, now, and I spend an hour or two a week keeping it up, revising my categories, and reviewing our expenses.  I am failing at reconciling, but it’s a learning curve, and parenting two little people gobbles some goals.\n  We’ve been able to save up for a new fence, a new dish washer, and are saving to replacing our water heater.  The dish washer and water heater were simple bad timing, not discretionary decisions.  The fence we saved up for!  We’re able to do all this without paying any financing.

It has helped completely reconstruct our finances and has been amazing for us.. but the other day they were forced (I believe) to start using a new account link server because do an acquisition and the new server is awful. It seems to work ok when it works but when it doesn’t work, the server takes an astronomical amount of time to relink accounts. For some reason I have to constantly relink my discover accounts, I always have, but now that process which used to take seconds takes minutes every time. I’m not sure if Discover or ynab is to blame but the new server is significantly drawing out the process. Other accounts which have been historically not able to connect at all but maybe once a week (commerce bank) is showing as connected with the new server but is not actually syncing. So that’s confusing because at least with the older server it would tell me when it wasn’t synced and was so when it was I could rely on the information but now it’s not even telling me so I can’t rely on it at all ever, I just have to manually balance. \n\nIt’s unfortunate that this has happened because ynab was awesome, and still is but I am very hopeful they can work out the issues with the new server which seem to be pestering others besides myself according to reviews.","title":"New link server 👎🏻","userName":"scott\u0026julia"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6580960480","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-27T23:04:50Z","rating":2,"review":"I really liked the idea of this app. I signed up for a trial subscription.

I spent the better part of an hour trying to link the accounts on and off, getting an error message with a message telling me it’s a temporary problem try again later, then I finally found some info within the app that there is a known issue with connecting/linking to Capital One, and it’s been an issue for many months possibly a year.

Look for the history icon on your category details screen—you’ll be able to view each month’s budgeting and moves for up to three past months, and any future months. iPad users, please note that Category Moves are only accessible via the Recent Moves panel. (i.e. if you tap on a blue category from Recent Moves.)\n\n• Ever wished you could duplicate your daily coffee or transit transaction for fast and easy entry? Now you can! Just select a transaction and choose the new \"Duplicate\" option from the More menu in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen. \n\n• Sometimes, payees are imported with extraneous text such that it's hard to tell what they actually refer to. In this release we're adding information about what we call the \"source payee\" to each imported transaction. This allows you to see how a transaction was originally recorded at your bank before our direct import partner made any attempt to clean or simplify it. \n\n• Rejoice, for you can now bulk edit transaction flags!\n\n• Account balance out of sync between YNAB and your financial institution?

No more keeping the total of your latest online shopping adventure in your head while you navigate to YNAB. \n\n• The icons for cleared and uncleared transactions are now easier to distinguish.\n\n• We added a few shortcuts to speed things up when using an iPad with an external keyboard.  Cmd+A selects all transactions, A approves the selected transactions, C clears/unclears the selected transactions, M matches the selected transactions, Backspace deletes the selected transactions, Cmd+N creates a new transaction, and Escape will end account reordering, leave transaction selection mode, and close a variety of other modals.

I feel weird that we’re still talking about hands now. Anyway, here are just a few of the bug-fixes that we did for this release:\n\nBug Fixes\n• We’ve fixed a bug that sometimes sent users to the budget switcher when starting the app, even though a budget was open when they last left the app. That’s like when you accidentally pull out your bookmark from the book you’re reading, which is super frustrating...which is why I dog-ear my pages...I know...I’M A MONSTER!!!\n• We’ve fixed a bug where the app would sometimes crash while starting up. Safety first! No one likes crashing.\n• We’ve fixed a bug where uploading an image in the support chat could sometimes crash the app. Yeah...that sounds like the opposite of how awesome our Support team is. “Oh...you need help with your budget? [image uploading]...and...oh...looks like YNAB crashed, and thanks for reaching out.” Fortunately, this is all fixed.","releaseDate":"2020-07-06"},{"versionDisplay":"2.13","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.13\nYou’ve heard of #lifegoals and maybe even #squadgoals, but what about #goalgoals?! Well, in this latest release, YNAB has fulfilled everyone’s #goalgoals by taking goals in YNAB to the next level. When setting goals in YNAB you’ll now have quite a few more options to help you accomplish all of your #moneygoals.\n\nImprovements\n[extreme Andrés Cantor voice] GoooooooooOOOOOOOOaaaaaaAAAAAlllllllllLLLLs\n• We added new “goal type selection” for increased clarity on which type of goal to use and when.\n• You can now set a target day of the month for Monthly goals.\n• There is also now a Weekly goal option where you can target a day of the week.\n• Lastly, we’ve also extended the By Date goals to allow selecting an exact target date. You can also (optionally) repeat goals every n months/years. And “n” in this case stands for number...I think...or maybe just months that start with “n”...November? Napril? Hmmm....\n------------------\n• We've now made it possible to collapse all scheduled transactions so you can decide whether you want to see them in your accounts or not. I wish I could literally and existentially just collapse my scheduled auto insurance bills.\n• You thought we were done talking about goals, didn’t you. Nope! YNAB will now show more information about how budgeting a negative amount affects a Target Balance By Date goal.\n• We changed the behavior for configuring notifications to always be consistent. You can now always configure your notifications from the Settings menu.\n\nBug fixes\n• This was just a small tweak, but now all transactions align vertically perfectly in the Accounts tab...or at least they’re more perfect...perfecter?\n• We fixed a rare crash that happened when going into split screen multitasking on iPad while reordering accounts. Listen, you multitasking YNABers, we get it. You want to do everything at once and we salute you, but give us time to catch up to your prolificness!\n• If you enabled larger accessibility text sizes in your iOS Settings, the payee wouldn't show in the transaction editor, but we fixed this particular issue.","releaseDate":"2020-06-17"},{"versionDisplay":"2.12.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.12.1\nOnce again, our developers have put on their bug-fixing pants (and pantsuits) to go-a-bug-wranglin’. And you’re all like, “why do you need to wear specific pants to fix bugs?” Hey, maybe don’t worry about how the bug-fixing sausage is made or how we just freely mix all sorts of metaphors together all willy-nilly. Just check out these sweet, sweet results:\n\n- Bug fixes\n• In some cases, the Create Goal button in the category details wouldn’t show up due to specific layout constraints. If it wasn’t showing up for you, it should now after this release.\n\n• Nearby payees can now be manually removed again without having to forget their location...or without having to choose to “forget their location.” Who among us wants to remember going to the DMV?\n\n• We fixed a rare issue where you could sometimes end up in an empty budget state on your phone while changing your password on web at the same time. No, this wasn’t an experimental Rule 5 - Transport Your Budget To An Alternate Dimension bit of code we were testing out. That hasn’t been released yet.\n\n• Fixed an edge case that would allow a transfer payee to get a geo location. For online banks that was probably extra creepy (your bank is calling from inside your house???) but it’s been fixed now!\n\n• We fixed a bug where the username and password input fields would be hidden behind the keyboard after returning to the app during login. Probably the most boring game of hide and seek ever, but that shouldn’t happen anymore.\n\n• On the iPhone SE, we fixed an issue where the notes field in the transaction editor would be hidden by the keyboard. Man. That keyboard is cramping our style. What are you trying to hide, keyboard?!\n\n• Fixed a rare crash when using Quick Budget. Um...that wasn’t what we meant by “Quick Budget.”\n\n• As part of our continued effort to make the web/mobile experiences more cohesive, we updated the icon for \"Account Settings\" to match what we have on web. Where we used to have a little \"settings panel\" icon, we now have a little \"user\" icon.","releaseDate":"2020-04-16"},{"versionDisplay":"2.12","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.12\nYou've signed in with a password and you may have signed in with Google, but I don't think you've truly lived until you've signed in with Apple.

The future has truly arrived...or, at least, this is a nice-to-have feature for all of you die hard Apple fans...are we calling you AppleHeads™? I am now. We've also pushed some nice bug-fixes for all of you hard core (I know what I did there) AppleHeads™:\n\nImprovements\n• When you go to delete a category with transactions, we will now show you a warning explaining the risks and offer to hide the categories instead. I believe it was either Sir Winston Churchill or maybe Spiderman’s uncle who said, \"with great power comes great responsibility\"...but also, it doesn't hurt to throw in a courtesy warning modal with that power too.\n\nBug fixes\n• Fixed an iPad crash in iOS 12 when tapping the \"More\" menu button while editing transactions...and you thought we meant MORE crashes. Nope! \n• Fixed a crash that happened after doing a Fresh Start. Hopefully now, though, only your money stress levels will crash after doing a Fresh Start to go out there and get it with your financial goals. You can do this!...especially now that the app isn't crashing.\n• Fixed an issue where the To Be Budgeted banner on iPad would sometimes show as green when the amount was 0.\n• Fixed an issue where the Overspent Categories banner sometimes displayed a count of 0. This was a bug and NOT a Minority Report-style \"Precog\" feature where we tell you that you have overspent categories before you have them. Whew.\n• Fixed the toolbar layout for approving or categorizing transactions.\n• Fixed an issue where the scroll indicator never reached the bottom of the table on the Budget, Accounts and Transaction screens\n\nUntil next time, AppleHeads™...","releaseDate":"2020-03-19"},{"versionDisplay":"2.11.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.11.1\nSo, it looks like all of our iOS developers woke up on January 1st and made a New Year's resolution to completely eradicate all bugs and possibly even the memory of bugs existing as a thing. I don't know if maybe they watched A Bug's Life or Antz or that Jerry Seinfeld movie with bees, and just said, \"who do these guys even think they are with their legs and wings, swimming in raindrops and ruining picnics?!!!\" But then, instead of taking out actual bugs, they just went ham on getting rid of a ton of bugs for this release. Whatever the case may be, we fixed a TON of bugs:\n\n• Fixed a rare issue where the app could get stuck loading on launch...just like how real bugs sometimes get stuck loading up on lunch.\n• On the iPad, we fixed some cases where the budget tab would show a different month after switching back to the app or resizing it. To be clear, a different \"month\" was showing up, not a different \"moth.\" Moths are terrifying the way they dive bomb your lantern when you're camping at night. Sorry, we’ll stop talking about real bugs now.\n• We made it so the actions on the transaction toolbar are now all accessible in all multitasking modes and orientations. BTW, Multitasking is new. Now it’s new and improved!\n• Fixed a bug where sometimes subcategories were not able to be reordered until after an app restart. Not ideal, but now that restart shouldn’t be necessary!\n• Replaced \"Add Transaction\" with \"Record Payment\" in context menus for debt categories. This wasn’t just a text swap. There is now an appropriate behavior that happens as well, such as the cursor going to the outflow field.\n• Fixed a bug where if you had a By Date goal and the target date had already passed, we weren't letting you save changes to a category! Whoops! Fixed now.\n• Changed the flow for covering overspending on iPad using the red pill. Now it goes straight to a filtered list of categories to cover the overspending with. Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with Keanu Reeves choosing to leave the Matrix to become a grown-up man fetus who gets flushed down a robot toilet...sounds maybe a little strange out-of-context...\n• Cleaned up icons, simplified color schemes and did some minor animation fixes. Nothing major here, but it will pave the way for possible improvements to colors, icons and animations in the future.\n• Fixed the top of the empty state text being cut off in the payee selection screen. Was the full state half empty, or was the empty state half full? Now, we’ll never know.\n• Fixed an issue where the nearby payee was not defaulted when creating a new transaction before the device location is loaded. But let’s be honest, it’s usually Amazon, Target or Costco #AmIRight?\n• Previously, when tapping and holding on a section header, the context menu came up for the first cell in the section, making it difficult to reorder groups. This prevented context menus from popping up on budget section headers and also on all cells while editing. But we fixed this.\n• Fixed a crash when unmatching transactions on iPad.\n• Fixed a rare crash when reordering category groups...and hey, no one likes crashes, except I remember that movie, “Crash” winning best picture or something. Also, that Dave Matthews song was OK. Other than that, though, crashes are universally not liked.","releaseDate":"2020-02-10"},{"versionDisplay":"2.11","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.11\n2020. We're here. THE FUTURE!!!! And we are so ready for 2020 with this release. In honor of basically all of us now being in Bladerunner (the Harrison Ford one...well, maybe the Ryan Gosling one...who knows?) this new version of YNAB supports screen rotation and split-view/slide-over multitasking on iPad. I know. We're pretty much just all cyborgs at this point. Talk about a futuristic feature: with multitasking, you can have YNAB open on one side of your iPad and have Amazon open on the other side, looking at all of your purchases trying to figure out what that $5.49 charge was...socks? A single light bulb?...that might explain why the future is so bright...\n\nImprovements\n• When a user creates a split transaction, but then only enters a single category, we used to just send over the category information into a flattened single transaction. With this release, we now preserve all data from that split transaction (amount and memo) and bring it over to the single parent transaction. Split it and forget it is what we like to say...nope...that's not a thing.\n\nBug fixes\n• We did a tweak to fix a bug where keypad button presses didn't always register if users moved their fingers slightly while tapping a button. Look, we're not saying you're a sloppy typer. We've all been over-excited to enter in a vacation savings goal or a transaction for a gift for a friend. Either way, you're covered now.\n• We fixed a few cases of horizontal scrolling and/or cutoff side margins on iPad popovers where the arrow is on the right or left.\n• We also fixed an issue where the bottom of the hidden categories list gets cut off. We said \"hidden,\" not cut in half!!!\n• Raise your hand if you hate unexpected crashes...oh, literally everyone hates this...we do too. So, we fixed an issue that was causing crashes when the app was attempting to present an action sheet on the transaction list popover. Whew. We're so glad that everyone raised their hands there.

It’s a whole bunch of yuletide bug-fixes and improvements that we’ve dropped just in time for the Holidays:\n\n• We’ve improved our integration with password managers. In particular, we now use iCloud key sharing, if you want to share credentials between the web and mobile app. Oh, what fun it is to login to YNAB without having to remember your password in a one-horse open (but secure) sleigh.\n• We improved the transaction details area, so that it no longer does any annoying horizontal scrolling. Hark! The horizontal angel of scrolling will no longer sing! Also, we don’t use the word “hark” enough. Let’s make that a thing.\n• Hark!...actually more like, “dark!” We fixed the text color for matched transactions that looked a little blurry in Dark Mode. “Was that letter an L or an I?” Now, you’ll know that there was “No L, Noooo L, No L, Noooooo LL.” I’ll see myself out.\n• We fixed an issue that involved the timing for when we ask for biometric authentication again. What more can we do? Baby, all we want for Christmas is...proper biometric authentication timing.\n• Alright, so remember how the matched transaction text was blurry for Dark Mode and then we fixed it? Well, our flag images were also a little blurry as well. And we’ve now fixed those flag images to be nice and crisp...like a winter day...like a winter wonderland, even?\n• There was an issue when using voiceover for frequency selection in the Repeat field. But we fixed it, and now things can be said many times, many ways…\n• We made the transaction screen button animations smoother. And by that, I mean we made them so they actually animate now. Hallelujah!\n\nAnd, with that, I know you’re tired of our Holiday-themed release notes, so we’ll just end by wishing you a Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and a Happy New Year from all of us at YNAB!","releaseDate":"2019-12-11"},{"versionDisplay":"2.10","releaseNotes":"You know how the old saying goes: the darker the mode, the sweeter the budgeting. That's totally not a thing anyone has ever said, but perhaps it will be? With this release, we've gone dark. Yep. We added Dark Mode to your favorite budgeting app. Some of you might be wondering if it will still be as satisfying to move money and crush debt in the dark...we think it will be! Don't be afraid of the dark! Give YNAB's new Dark Mode a try! And when you're ready to turn the light back on, check out some of the other bug fixes and improvements that we've made in this release:\n\nWhat’s new\n• Dark Mode - I can't stress enough how deliciously dark YNAB is now. It's at least 100% darker than our normal mode.\n• iOS 13 Context Menus - We've taken advantage of this helpful, new iOS 13 feature. Now you can do literally dozens of contextually appropriate actions in the budget view, account view and transaction lists. These menus will save you time by doing all sorts of things like pre-populating the appropriate category when adding transaction or giving you the ability to add or edit goals in the contextually appropriate category.\n\nBug fixes\n• We fixed a budget reorder issue...well, actually it was two issues. When reordering the top budget group in a budget table, the other budget views would get pushed all the way down. Even worse than that, though, was if you only had two budget groups, the reordering would appear to work, but upon refreshing the table, it would revert back to the order it was in. We fixed these issues and order (or reorder) has been restored to the universe...er, your budget.\n• In iOS 13, there was a cursor issue when YNABers were going in to edit a budget category. You would have to delete the category name in order to get the cursor to move from the beginning of the text field. We went ahead and fixed that, so that should be an improvement upon a cursory reassessment of your budget categories...is that what 'cursory' means?\n• We recently added the search feature to our iOS app, and it's pretty great. But also, there was a small issue...when users were tapping the \"Cancel\" button to cancel their search, the \"Cancel\" button wasn't going away. It was overstaying its welcome. Well, \"Cancel\" button, I hate to tell you this, but after you've been tapped, that's really all that we need from you. You're great. We love what you do, but when you cancel something, you really just need to go away until we need you again. Oh, also, we didn't just tell the \"Cancel\" button to go away. We actually fixed the issue.\n• We were able to fix an issue where the bottom tab bar would disappear in some cases when YNABers were moving money or editing transactions. We've got to give a huge shout out to our new mobile developer, Itai, on a lot of these fixes. He came into a world where we've got buttons not disappearing when they should and tab bars disappearing when they shouldn't and he totally wrangled these disappearing/reappearing problem children and put them back in line.
