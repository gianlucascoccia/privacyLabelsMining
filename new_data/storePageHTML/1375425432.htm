        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is one of the best games of this genre, all the others I have stopped playing but this is lasting so far. I downloaded after the annoying persistent advertisement. Keeps me busy, it’s much easier to do daily and weekly quests and all that. There’s so much to do. I’d say I’m progressing very well for not paying any money, just making sure I check in. Everything is great.<br /><br />EXCEPT, the arcane labyrinth has become darn near impossible. I understand it’s supposed to scale up with your progress, but there’s been twice now that I can’t get past level two of the labyrinth no how many Dura’s Tears I use. The reason I’m writing this review is because I almost finished the level two boss five minutes ago, but there’s one hero I cannot beat. After using Dura’s Tears twice, my teams of five cannot get this lvl 160 Antandra to half health before she singlehandedly destroys alllll of my hero’s, twice. I can’t imagine floor three at this point. My highest hero’s are level 120 and I feel the only way to break this limit is to pay money. All my Resonating Crystal hero’s are like level 111. This is the kinda thing that makes the game monotonous. I cannot for the life of me beat this one hero with everything that I’ve worked towards, and I don’t wanna pay any money.<br /><br />Other than that the game is fantastic</p>

Furthermore, the interplay of the heroes will create a superposition effect.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Usually I don’t play much mobile games, but this one caught my attention.  I have played afk games before but this one is different in the sense that the feeling of waiting.. is rewarding.  I know sounds funny but I actually enjoy the games mechanics.  The longer you wait the more resources you collect to equip your heroes and level them up.  You can choose to spend real money to buy gems which can be used to get better heroes and gear which sounds like a bad thing, expect it’s not.  The deals they offer is actually not that bad with specials popping up so every often and new deals coming out daily.  The other thing I like about this game is that if you truly just want to grind your way to success, you can you just have to be determined to do so.  Another cool concept which is new to me is the ability to pay for one of two subscriptions. The normal monthly which rewards you with a pretty sum of gems for the price tag of $5 a month (not that bad considering the amount you will receive overall) and the premium subscription which is $15 (insanely high amount of gems rewarded, around 120,000 which is about $100 dollars worth upfront if you think about it) overall, I’m a fan of the game and I’ll continue on playing.</p>

    Interesting game but it has some bugs

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have played mini games from this genre and this is practically the best one I have played so far. But there are many bugs and kinks that need to be worked out like the arcane labyrinth. I know it’s supposed to be fun and challenging. (Not really), But it is nearly impossible I have no idea how many Dura Tears I have used. I’m reading most of the reviews and them telling the people that they can’t even get past the loading screen but I really have no problems with that. I do have some bugs to where it would completely kick me off of the game when I am battling someone in the arena of heroes. There are also some times where I’m chatting with someone it would kick me off of the game entirely or the bar switching between the chat and the battles would completely disappear. It’s a very good game but the iOS version is very buggy and I beg of you to please fix it to make the experience better for all IOS players. It is a very good game otherwise but for some reason why people lash out on others in chat when they don’t get the character they want or when their character dies in the arcane labyrinth which I think makes absolutely no sense some of the people are really toxic but I digress this has nothing to do with the game again just please fix the bugs and maybe change your personalities too. 😚🥰😋😤🥺</p>

I downloaded after the annoying persistent advertisement. Keeps me busy, it’s much easier to do daily and weekly quests and all that. There’s so much to do. I’d say I’m progressing very well for not paying any money, just making sure I check in. Everything is great.\n\nEXCEPT, the arcane labyrinth has become darn near impossible. I understand it’s supposed to scale up with your progress, but there’s been twice now that I can’t get past level two of the labyrinth no how many Dura’s Tears I use. The reason I’m writing this review is because I almost finished the level two boss five minutes ago, but there’s one hero I cannot beat. After using Dura’s Tears twice, my teams of five cannot get this lvl 160 Antandra to half health before she singlehandedly destroys alllll of my hero’s, twice. I can’t imagine floor three at this point. My highest hero’s are level 120 and I feel the only way to break this limit is to pay money. All my Resonating Crystal hero’s are like level 111. This is the kinda thing that makes the game monotonous. I cannot for the life of me beat this one hero with everything that I’ve worked towards, and I don’t wanna pay any money.\n\nOther than that the game is fantastic","title":"One frustrating problem.","userName":"NotFootballSavvy"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5515285160","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-02-11T04:23:47Z","rating":5,"review":"Usually I don’t play much mobile games, but this one caught my attention.  I have played afk games before but this one is different in the sense that the feeling of waiting.. is rewarding.  I know sounds funny but I actually enjoy the games mechanics.  The longer you wait the more resources you collect to equip your heroes and level them up.  You can choose to spend real money to buy gems which can be used to get better heroes and gear which sounds like a bad thing, expect it’s not.  The deals they offer is actually not that bad with specials popping up so every often and new deals coming out daily.  The other thing I like about this game is that if you truly just want to grind your way to success, you can you just have to be determined to do so.  Another cool concept which is new to me is the ability to pay for one of two subscriptions. The normal monthly which rewards you with a pretty sum of gems for the price tag of $5 a month (not that bad considering the amount you will receive overall) and the premium subscription which is $15 (insanely high amount of gems rewarded, around 120,000 which is about $100 dollars worth upfront if you think about it) overall, I’m a fan of the game and I’ll continue on playing.","title":"Just started and liking it so far","userName":"VikaVeeks"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7599616302","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-07-21T00:32:30Z","rating":4,"review":"I have played mini games from this genre and this is practically the best one I have played so far.

I’m reading most of the reviews and them telling the people that they can’t even get past the loading screen but I really have no problems with that. I do have some bugs to where it would completely kick me off of the game when I am battling someone in the arena of heroes. There are also some times where I’m chatting with someone it would kick me off of the game entirely or the bar switching between the chat and the battles would completely disappear. It’s a very good game but the iOS version is very buggy and I beg of you to please fix it to make the experience better for all IOS players. It is a very good game otherwise but for some reason why people lash out on others in chat when they don’t get the character they want or when their character dies in the arcane labyrinth which I think makes absolutely no sense some of the people are really toxic but I digress this has nothing to do with the game again just please fix the bugs and maybe change your personalities too. 😚🥰😋😤🥺","title":"Interesting game but it has some bugs","userName":"Im_theJewel2009"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5322600201","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-12-26T16:57:58Z","developerResponse":{"id":12609390,"body":"Greetings Adventurer, we appreciate for your gorgeous feedback and we always strive to attach the players' experience to the priority.

I like the premise that gatcha games have, and know what these games need to have in order to be enjoyable. This game has the usual aspects with the summoning type system and level layout. The characters/artwork are beautiful as well making it one of the most eye catching game I have played in a while. In my opinion, though, the best aspect is the AFK part of this game. Most like it don’t have this system and requires you to pay money and constantly play in order to progress at a good rate. This game allows you to not only spend less money but also progress at the same rate even without being active. I wish that more games could have this type of system. This was what I enjoyed from the game so far.\n\nIn another review of this game, someone had a problem where their game would crash constantly. In response to this, a developer instructed to free up space on their phone by at least 2 GB. I have 5 GB of free space, but I cannot even access the loading screen without the game crashing. Just in case internet access is a factor, I have very fast and good connection. This problem is so bad that every time I delete and reinstall the app, I can only get to the game twice before it refuses to open again. I have done this 5 times already.

It is one of those few games whose mechanics are simple to learn yet feels challenging as you progress. I love the amount of characters that are available in the game, and the progression mechanics are great. My biggest flaw with this game is the loading screen. What I mean by loading screen, is not the initial app start up screen that pops up, rather the loading icon with the galloping horses pulling a carriage. This icon pops up when the game is trying to load or render something such as an action (input by user). I am playing this game on an IPhone 8 Plus 256GB model and with the latest version of Mac iOS, but this game runs absolutely horrendous on this software (not the hardware on the phone itself or my internet connection). It seems like anytime I click a “Begin” button, try to collect loot, open or click anything, I will almost (about 90% of the time) always get this annoying loading screen which can last 5-20 seconds or more. I have this same game on an older 2016 Samsung galaxy tablet with only 2 GB of RAM and this game plays as smooth as possible on that device. The developers really need to address this issue since it’s been going on since launch date and seems to be roughly the same now on the iOS version.","title":"Amazing Game, but iOS Version has Bugs","userName":"Ramon Lomeli"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4263447289","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-06-04T16:51:57Z","rating":5,"review":"This game is really fun and has a great system to it. If you want to grind you can to a certain point in this game but if you only have a few minutes to play then this is it too as long as you collect your chest/ 12hr time slot of built up material/xp/gold/etc. The characters are great and the game is always somehow fresh in its own way with a lot of unlocking but fair qualities to it. The developers and artist did an amazing job on this game making it easy to navigate, not cluttered, no ads! And minimal BUY HERE options.

It can be fun because it requires less active commitment to play and or grind for exp, weapons, and money. Sadly if you don’t spend real money into the game you have no chance of success. The sheer amount of duplicates needed to Ascend/upgrade your units is staggering. There is a reward system per pull to get a random epic but that is few and far between and isn’t enough to make continual progress as the only things that matter are 4skill epic pulls and they are extremely rare. The tower and campaign are similar but the arcane labyrinth is a demented joke since after you get past the first few days you will probably never beat level 3 without using revival potions and even then the matches are setup to be double or triple power vs any of your troops. And the labyrinth scales against you so if you get stronger your enemies double which is kind of crappy since the game sets quest rewards for completing an event that can’t be defeated by non paying customers. This is a F2P P2W game so it boils down to you will either take it for its content and enjoy it or you won’t . It does have some interesting game mechanics that make it a good time waster without needing a story to drag you through the game. Plus the developer does perform hot fixes when needed and releases updates and content regularly.","title":"Great Game a typical F2P P2W Model","userName":"D0gb3rt"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7417803954","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-06-02T13:34:40Z","rating":4,"review":"This game is very enjoyable because it offers a very immersive play experience alongside interesting mechanics. There’s stories behind every character and the artwork is fantastic. Everything looks incredible and what’s more they actually took the time to insert a lot of lore into it. The mechanics are interesting because the AFK farming goes hand in hand with doing your own fighting in game to earn lots of rewards. There’s a lot of modes to enjoy besides the story that make it quite fun. The only downside to this game is that eventually it may feel like you have to pay to win, and that might be the case, depending on your goals. There’s always gonna be people spending more money than you to win in PvP, but if you put in the hard work or even just show up every day to claim those AFK rewards, then you’ll have plenty of fun enjoying the story with your well built heroes and you’ll still have a decent showing in arena. All in all, this game is pretty F2P friendly and I love everything else about it too. The only things holding it back from a five star rating are how little you interact in combat (even without auto turned on) and the minor P2W mechanics. Other than that I would still highly recommend this game as it is an enjoyable experience overall.","title":"Mostly Enjoyable","userName":"Jayce Peterson"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4498286580","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-07-21T18:58:55Z","developerResponse":{"id":9777439,"body":"Dear Hero, thanks for your feedback.

I thought adding this feature would be a really nice idea. But then I realized this system needed some work. The fact that you can only use your friends hero for only 1 battle per week is kind of outrageous. Also, once you return your friend’s hero back it doesn’t let anyone else rent it for the entire rest of the week and I think that’s a bit stupid.\n\nI think we should be able to rent the hero and actually be able to use them to help us on our quests, and not just for once battle a week. It takes a long time to get through the campaign, and can even take a week or more to get through a stage.
