        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I am one that doesn’t put a price on knowledge. Knowledge is a very important part of our existence. Is this going to be a long drawn out review? No. To put this simply, the information, guides, and workbooks you get for this program are at a good price. Yes it’s a subscription but it’s a valuable one. Learning about cooking, negotiating, gardening, business, finance from some of the most outstanding and intelligent people out there is a fantastic opportunity. I am a nobody, but I love learning about business and this has helped me tremendously from the few months I’ve had it. As some of the greats have said, “listen to each side, you might learn something you didn’t already know.” The most important part, repetition. Once you have a skill down, listen or watch it again to better hone your skill. Knowledge is not cheap, you can either learn it by your experience or speed the process up by learning from someone else in the field you want to be in. <br /><br />Did this become a long and drawn out review? In my opinion, yes. Was this helpful to the next person deciding to purchase this subscription, learn new concepts, apply them in their lives and become part of a larger master mind group? Well, only you can decide. If this helps you decide to get the subscription I can promise you it’s work it. <br /><br />Keep learning my friends. Be a student, not a follower</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>From the moment I saw the first commercial for Master Class I said that is compelling. A year later my wife gifted me an unlimited subscription and I have been absorbing some of the greatest content from true experts that I have ever found.  Master Classes are each independent and different in their own ways because the producers let the experts dictate the pace and the topics that are most important to the instructor and therefore the audience.  Over the last 6months I have watched at least 25 full classes and parts and pieces of close to 25 more.  There is so much amazing content.  I devour the marketing/ business and off beat topics.   I have learned skateboarding from Tony Hawk, Magic from Penn and Teller, and the inside story as to how Disney purchased Pixar directly from the man who orchestrated it.  I see different topics that I think, that doesn’t interest me, but when I watch the opener I am usually hooked, and later find so many things that are applicable to me in my personal and professional life.  I am always recommending Master Class to others. Where else can you get inside the thought process of a writer, composer, chef, skater, magician, designer, photographer, negotiator and so many more.  It’s amazing.  Thank you for all the time that has been dedicated to making these classes so engaging, educational, and entertaining.</p>

The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.\n\nThird parties may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above. These third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) may also serve tailored ads to you as you use the Internet and Internet-connected applications, and access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services to assist in this activity.\n\nWe neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link, or Your Online Choices to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.\n\nPlease note that if you exercise the choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.\n\n3. Notice Concerning Do Not Track\nDo Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here.\n\nHow We Share and Disclose your Information\nMasterClass will share your information in the following ways:\n\nAffiliates and Subsidiaries. We may share information we collect within the Yanka Industries family of companies to deliver products and services to you, ensure a consistent level of service, and enhance our products, services, and your customer experience.\n\nService Providers. We provide access to or share your information with select third parties who perform services on our behalf. They have access to perform these services but are prohibited from using your information for other purposes. They provide a variety of services to us, including billing, sales, marketing, product content and features, advertising, analytics, research, customer service, data storage, security, fraud prevention, payment processing, and legal services.\n\nProtection of MasterClass and Others. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that we may access, retain and disclose the information we collect and maintain about you if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, retention or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process (e.g. a subpoena or court order); (b) enforce our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; and/or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of MasterClass, its agents and affiliates, its users and/or the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, and spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes.\n\nBusiness Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge, or partner with other companies. In such transactions (including in contemplation of such transactions), user information may be among the transferred assets. If a portion or all of our assets are sold or transferred to a third-party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets. If such transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, we will comply with such restrictions.\n\nPublic Forums. Certain features of our Services make it possible for you to share comments publicly with other users. Any information that you submit through such features is not confidential, and we may use it for any purpose (including in testimonials or other marketing materials). Any information you post openly in these ways will be available to the public at large and potentially accessible through third-party search engines. Accordingly, please take care when using these features.\n\nAggregate/Anonymous Information. From time to time, we may share Aggregate/Anonymous Information about use of the Services, such as by publishing a report on usage trends. The sharing of such data is unrestricted.\n\nRetention of Your Information\nWe keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws.\n\nHow We Protect Your Information\nMasterClass takes technical and organizational security measures to protect the information provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any information to MasterClass via the Internet.\n\nThird Party Links and Features\nThe Services contain links to third-party websites such as social media sites, and also contain third-party plug-ins (such as the Facebook “like” button and Twitter “follow” button). If you choose to use these sites or features, you may disclose your information not just to those third-parties, but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function. We are not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party websites or services, and not this Privacy Policy. We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third-parties.\n\nChildren's Privacy\nThe Services are intended for general audiences and not for children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected “personal information” (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13 without valid parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible. We do not knowingly process data of EU residents under the age of 16 without parental consent. If we become aware that we have collected data from an EU resident under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible. We also comply with other age restrictions and requirements in accordance with applicable local laws.\n\nData Subject Rights and Choices\nDepending on your jurisdiction of residence, you may have certain rights with respect to your information as further described in this section.\n\n1. Your Legal Rights\nIf you would like further information in relation to your legal rights under applicable law or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us using the information in the “Contact Information” section below at any time. Your local laws (e.g., in the EU) may permit you to request that we:\n\nprovide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you\nprevent the processing of your information for direct-marketing purposes (including any direct marketing processing based on profiling)\nupdate information which is out of date or incorrect\ndelete certain information which we are holding about you\nrestrict the way that we process and disclose certain of your information\ntransfer your information to a third party provider of services\nrevoke your consent for the processing of your information\nWe will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.\n\n2. Marketing Communications and Sharing\nYou may instruct us not to use your contact information to contact you by email, postal mail, or phone regarding products, services, promotions and special events that might appeal to your interests by contacting us using the information below. In commercial email messages, you can also opt out by following the instructions located at the bottom of such emails. Please note that, regardless of your request, we may still use and share certain information as permitted by applicable law. For example, you may not opt out of certain operational emails, such as those reflecting our relationship or transactions with you, or important notifications regarding classes in which you are enrolled.\n\nLegal Bases for Use of Your Information\nThe legal bases for using your information as set out in this Privacy Policy are as follows:\n\nWhere use of your information is necessary to perform our obligations under a contract with you (for example, to comply with: the terms of service of our websites which you accept by browsing the websites/registering; and/or our contract to provide our Services to you);\nWhere use of your information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for example, to provide security for our website and applications; operate our business and our Services; make and receive payments; comply with legal requirements and defend our legal rights; prevent fraud and to know the customer to whom we are providing Services);\nWhere we are required to process information in accordance with an EU Member State legal obligation; or\nWhere we have your consent, in accordance with applicable law.\nInternational Transfer and Privacy Shield\nThe information discussed in this Policy is processed in the United States by MasterClass, whose principal office in the United States is located at 660 4th Street #443, San Francisco, CA 94107.\n\nMasterClass complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. MasterClass has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.\n\nIn compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, MasterClass commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal data. European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact MasterClass at privacy@masterclass.com. MasterClass has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by MasterClass, please visit the JAMS EU Privacy Shield web site at https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information and to file a complaint. Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel. MasterClass is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with respect to its compliance with the provisions of the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield.\n\nIf you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. As described above, we also may subcontract the processing of your data to, or otherwise share your data with, other members within the MasterClass group of companies, service providers, and business partners in countries other than your country of residence, including the United States, in accordance with applicable law. Such third parties may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of Services to you, the processing of transactions and/or the provision of support services. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage or use. MasterClass will take reasonable and appropriate steps necessary to ensure that any third party who is acting as a “data processor” under EU and Swiss terminology is processing the personal data we entrust to them in a manner that is consistent with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles. MasterClass is potentially liable in cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, respectively.\n\nIf applicable, you may make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority in the country where you reside. Alternatively you may seek a remedy through local courts if you believe your rights have been breached.\n\nChanges to our Privacy Policy\nWe reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Services, or advances in technology. We will make the revised Privacy Policy accessible through the Services, so you should review the Privacy Policy periodically. You can know if the Privacy Policy has changed since the last time you reviewed it by checking the “Date of Last Revision\" included at the beginning of the document. If we make a material change to the Policy, you will be provided with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements. By continuing to use the Services, you are confirming that you have read and understood the latest version of this Privacy Policy.\n\nContact Information\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions about MasterClass' Privacy Policy or the information practices of the Services.\n\nYou may contact us as follows:\n660 4th Street #443\nSan Francisco, CA 94107\nsupport@masterclass.com","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Is there anything more inspiring than learning from a master?

Information We Collect Through Automated Means\nWhen you use our Services, we collect certain information as described in this Section. As discussed further below, we and our service providers (which are third party companies that work on our behalf) may use a variety of technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.\n\nWebsites.

Information We Collect From Social Media and Other Content Platforms\nIf you access the Services through a third-party connection or log-in (e.g., through a social network like Facebook or Twitter), you may allow us to have access to and store certain information from your social network profile. This can include your name, gender, profile picture, your “likes” and check-ins, and your list of friends, depending on your settings on such services. If you do not wish to have this information shared, do not use a social networking connection to access the Services. For a description of how social networking sites handle your information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use, which may permit you to modify your privacy settings. You may also have the option of posting your Services activities to Social Networking Services when you access content through the Services (for example, you may post to Facebook that you enrolled in a class on the Service); you acknowledge that if you choose to use this feature, your friends, followers and subscribers on any Social Networking Services you have enabled will be able to view such activity.\n\n4. Information We Collect from Others\nWe may receive additional information such as demographic and statistical information from third parties, such as business partners, marketers, researchers, analysts, and other parties that we may attribute to you based on your assignment to certain statistical groups. We use this information to supplement the information that we collect directly from you in order to derive your possible interests and to provide more relevant experiences for you and improve our products, analytics, and advertising.\n\nHow We Use Your Information\nWe, or our service providers, use your information for various purposes depending on the types of information we have collected from and about you, in order to:\n\nComplete a purchase or provide the Services you have requested, including invoicing and accounting\nRespond to your request for information and provide you with more effective and efficient customer service\nProvide you with updates and information about classes in which you have enrolled\nContact you by email, postal mail, or phone regarding MasterClass and third-party products, services, surveys, research studies, promotions, special events and other subjects that we think may be of interest to you\nCustomize the advertising and content you see on the Services\nHelp us better understand your interests and needs, and improve the Services, including through research and reports, and test and create new products, features, and services\nSecure our websites and applications, and resolve app crashes and other issues being reported\nComply with any procedures, laws, and regulations which apply to us where it is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others\nEstablish, exercise, or defend our legal rights where it is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others\nCombined Information.For the purposes discussed in this Privacy Policy, we may combine the information that we collect through the Services with information that we receive from other sources, both online and offline, and use such combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n\nAggregate/Anonymous Data. We may aggregate and/or anonymize any information collected\n\nthrough the Services so that such information can no longer be linked to you or your device. We may use such information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including advertisers, promotional partners, and sponsors.\n\nCookies and Similar Technologies\nTo collect the information in the “Information We Collect Through Automated Means” section above, we and our service providers use Internet server logs, cookies, tracking pixels, and other similar tracking technologies. We use these technologies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future, by understanding and remembering your particular browsing preferences. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site that enable us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited; (iv) enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions. Some cookies are placed in your browser cache while those associated with Flash technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files.\n\nAs we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods. Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (e.g., Internet Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari). You can also manage the use of Flash technologies, including flash cookies and local storage objects, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website. Please note that by blocking, disabling, or managing any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services. For more information about our use of cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.\n\nOnline Analytics and Advertising\n1. Analytics\nWe may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics) on our Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here.\n\nIf you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.\n\n2. Online Advertising\nThe Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.\n\nThird parties may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above. These third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) may also serve tailored ads to you as you use the Internet and Internet-connected applications, and access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services to assist in this activity.\n\nWe neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link, or Your Online Choices to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.\n\nPlease note that if you exercise the choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.\n\n3. Notice Concerning Do Not Track\nDo Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here.\n\nHow We Share and Disclose your Information\nMasterClass will share your information in the following ways:\n\nAffiliates and Subsidiaries. We may share information we collect within the Yanka Industries family of companies to deliver products and services to you, ensure a consistent level of service, and enhance our products, services, and your customer experience.\n\nService Providers. We provide access to or share your information with select third parties who perform services on our behalf. They have access to perform these services but are prohibited from using your information for other purposes. They provide a variety of services to us, including billing, sales, marketing, product content and features, advertising, analytics, research, customer service, data storage, security, fraud prevention, payment processing, and legal services.\n\nProtection of MasterClass and Others. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that we may access, retain and disclose the information we collect and maintain about you if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, retention or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process (e.g. a subpoena or court order); (b) enforce our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; and/or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of MasterClass, its agents and affiliates, its users and/or the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, and spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes.\n\nBusiness Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge, or partner with other companies. In such transactions (including in contemplation of such transactions), user information may be among the transferred assets. If a portion or all of our assets are sold or transferred to a third-party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets. If such transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, we will comply with such restrictions.\n\nPublic Forums. Certain features of our Services make it possible for you to share comments publicly with other users. Any information that you submit through such features is not confidential, and we may use it for any purpose (including in testimonials or other marketing materials). Any information you post openly in these ways will be available to the public at large and potentially accessible through third-party search engines. Accordingly, please take care when using these features.\n\nAggregate/Anonymous Information. From time to time, we may share Aggregate/Anonymous Information about use of the Services, such as by publishing a report on usage trends. The sharing of such data is unrestricted.\n\nRetention of Your Information\nWe keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws.\n\nHow We Protect Your Information\nMasterClass takes technical and organizational security measures to protect the information provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any information to MasterClass via the Internet.\n\nThird Party Links and Features\nThe Services contain links to third-party websites such as social media sites, and also contain third-party plug-ins (such as the Facebook “like” button and Twitter “follow” button). If you choose to use these sites or features, you may disclose your information not just to those third-parties, but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function. We are not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party websites or services, and not this Privacy Policy. We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third-parties.\n\nChildren's Privacy\nThe Services are intended for general audiences and not for children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected “personal information” (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13 without valid parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible. We do not knowingly process data of EU residents under the age of 16 without parental consent. If we become aware that we have collected data from an EU resident under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible. We also comply with other age restrictions and requirements in accordance with applicable local laws.\n\nData Subject Rights and Choices\nDepending on your jurisdiction of residence, you may have certain rights with respect to your information as further described in this section.\n\n1. Your Legal Rights\nIf you would like further information in relation to your legal rights under applicable law or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us using the information in the “Contact Information” section below at any time. Your local laws (e.g., in the EU) may permit you to request that we:\n\nprovide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you\nprevent the processing of your information for direct-marketing purposes (including any direct marketing processing based on profiling)\nupdate information which is out of date or incorrect\ndelete certain information which we are holding about you\nrestrict the way that we process and disclose certain of your information\ntransfer your information to a third party provider of services\nrevoke your consent for the processing of your information\nWe will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.\n\n2. Marketing Communications and Sharing\nYou may instruct us not to use your contact information to contact you by email, postal mail, or phone regarding products, services, promotions and special events that might appeal to your interests by contacting us using the information below. In commercial email messages, you can also opt out by following the instructions located at the bottom of such emails. Please note that, regardless of your request, we may still use and share certain information as permitted by applicable law. For example, you may not opt out of certain operational emails, such as those reflecting our relationship or transactions with you, or important notifications regarding classes in which you are enrolled.\n\nLegal Bases for Use of Your Information\nThe legal bases for using your information as set out in this Privacy Policy are as follows:\n\nWhere use of your information is necessary to perform our obligations under a contract with you (for example, to comply with: the terms of service of our websites which you accept by browsing the websites/registering; and/or our contract to provide our Services to you);\nWhere use of your information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for example, to provide security for our website and applications; operate our business and our Services; make and receive payments; comply with legal requirements and defend our legal rights; prevent fraud and to know the customer to whom we are providing Services);\nWhere we are required to process information in accordance with an EU Member State legal obligation; or\nWhere we have your consent, in accordance with applicable law.\nInternational Transfer and Privacy Shield\nThe information discussed in this Policy is processed in the United States by MasterClass, whose principal office in the United States is located at 660 4th Street #443, San Francisco, CA 94107.\n\nMasterClass complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. MasterClass has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact MasterClass at privacy@masterclass.com.

Knowledge is a very important part of our existence. Is this going to be a long drawn out review? No. To put this simply, the information, guides, and workbooks you get for this program are at a good price. Yes it’s a subscription but it’s a valuable one. Learning about cooking, negotiating, gardening, business, finance from some of the most outstanding and intelligent people out there is a fantastic opportunity. I am a nobody, but I love learning about business and this has helped me tremendously from the few months I’ve had it. As some of the greats have said, “listen to each side, you might learn something you didn’t already know.” The most important part, repetition. Once you have a skill down, listen or watch it again to better hone your skill. Knowledge is not cheap, you can either learn it by your experience or speed the process up by learning from someone else in the field you want to be in. \n\nDid this become a long and drawn out review? In my opinion, yes. Was this helpful to the next person deciding to purchase this subscription, learn new concepts, apply them in their lives and become part of a larger master mind group? Well, only you can decide. If this helps you decide to get the subscription I can promise you it’s work it. \n\nKeep learning my friends.

A year later my wife gifted me an unlimited subscription and I have been absorbing some of the greatest content from true experts that I have ever found.  Master Classes are each independent and different in their own ways because the producers let the experts dictate the pace and the topics that are most important to the instructor and therefore the audience.  Over the last 6months I have watched at least 25 full classes and parts and pieces of close to 25 more.  There is so much amazing content.  I devour the marketing/ business and off beat topics.   I have learned skateboarding from Tony Hawk, Magic from Penn and Teller, and the inside story as to how Disney purchased Pixar directly from the man who orchestrated it.  I see different topics that I think, that doesn’t interest me, but when I watch the opener I am usually hooked, and later find so many things that are applicable to me in my personal and professional life.  I am always recommending Master Class to others. Where else can you get inside the thought process of a writer, composer, chef, skater, magician, designer, photographer, negotiator and so many more.  It’s amazing.

Even simply navigating the app and adding classes to my list is a tedious game of workarounds. Honestly, don’t buy a Masterclass pass until they fix this app; the frustrations made me wish I hadn’t activated it. Someone needs to teach a Masterclass on the basics of app development so the Masterclass team can watch it. The current app execution unfortunately fails those who put in time and effort to provide the content, and is a waste of time for those who attempt to view it. \n\nApp devs, I beg you to embrace the challenge before you and make this at least more functional. Ask several people of differing age groups to try to use this and just watch them.

Obviously the content is what’s most important, but it is a very glitchy interface. I’ll name a few of the larger problems, but there are many smaller ones. \n1) When Chromecasting, the next lesson will not play automatically, but it will be queued up on the phone not playing. To play the next video you need to start playing a different one (this will cause it to disconnect from the chrome device) and then go back to the video you want and reconnect to the chrome device. \n2) If you pause a video and leave the app open it will remain paused for 10-20 minutes and then begin paying again of its own accord on the phone in the background. This has happened twice and the first time it ran the entire night while I was asleep and marked all lessons played in that course. \n3) If you want to browse through a course or simply add it to your list, the first video plays automatically and you have to pause it. So if you’re enrolling in many courses you have to start and pause a dozen times in a row just to add some courses to your list. \nOverall the service is great, but the app needs some work.","title":"Content is 5 stars, app is a 1","userName":"Ludo_Rock23"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7551118930","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-07-07T23:48:05Z","rating":5,"review":"This app in my opinion is awesome and although most of the reviews say that it is glitchy and laggy, it’s mainly because they are using MasterClass on chrome or safari, which is one exact reason to download the app for the best experience instead of having to log in every time you want to watch it. Another reason to get this app is because you can download classes or lessons and watch them on the road, travel by plane, or really anywhere. But another thing to be aware of is that it’s 12+ and I totally agree, if you’re a parent or simply a person that doesn’t like swearing, its language is very mild, so you won’t be hearing bleep bleep all the time.

Bought, downloaded the app, signed up and ready to learn. Then... super disappointed to find that the advertised classes- specifically Ron Howard’s, one of the top-rated and recommended classes on here- has been condensed down and does not include some of the key lessons I was excited to take. If you’re expecting to learn how to stage with camera crew and actors, you will be let down. Of the 32 classes with Ron Howard that were previously available, according to MasterClass support, they have been “condensed” down to 13 classes that do not include important lessons in staging, casting, production design, working with cinematographers and several case studies. The condensed 13 lessons just touch on these so it’s like paying for a book and just getting to read the chapter summaries rather than getting to read the whole book.

Maybe 2 stars is harsh, but 3 stars is almost too kind. The app’s most egregious fault is when you download lessons. Not only is downloading too slow, it is unreliable, and worse still, if you re-start your phone, you lose all previous downloads, forcing you to start the (slow, unreliable) download process all over again. In effect, the app fills you with frustration and not learning. It distracts you from the serene beauty of the lessons it should deliver.  Interface-wise, it looks good, and seemingly simple enough to navigate. What I don’t like is how it tries too hard to get you to look and see other classes. I just want to get to my class, and not be distracted by the other goodies. Last, but not least, it is a slow app. It lags behind my navigation choices. For example, nothing happens when I press download 3 times, and then too late after, 3 pop up options show up one after the other. Argh.
