Each season of ranked matches lasts for roughly two months, and during this period Governors can compete for higher ranks to win greater rewards. <br /> 2) We’ve changed the weekly rewards chest into an activity points chest, which can accumulate activity points from both wins and losses.<br /> 3) Weekly rewards not claimed by Governors will be distributed via mail at the end of the weekly event.<br /> 4) New AFK penalty mechanisms have been introduced.<br /> 5) A new View Profile function has been added, which allows you to view your own stats, other Governors’ stats, and the battle history for Champions of Olympia.<br /> 6) A new ranking system has been added, which will give the top 200 ranked Governors extra rewards at the end of the season.<br /> <br /> 4.

After updating, you can swap equipment from extra rewards in the newly opened event simply by swapping core rewards. <br /> 5) Rewards in the “Lost Canyon” exchange shop have been adjusted, and “Peter’s Sickle” fragments have been added to the available rewards.<br /> 6) Rewards for the “Karuak Ceremony” event have been adjusted. After defeating a Lvl 30 or 40 Barbarian (Elite) in an individual challenge on “Normal” difficulty or above, the “Brand-new Starlight Sculpture” featured in extra rewards will be replaced with “Barbaric Totem” fragments.<br /> 7) Rewards in the “Lohar’s Trial” event have been improved. Advanced equipment fragments from defeating Lohar have been replaced with crystal keys, and the drop rate for “Lohar’s Bone Necklace” fragments has also increased.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hey devs and other people viewing this. This is a fun game I’ve met people etc, and there’s very fun things that I love about this game, I’ve maybe have been playing about a 3-4 weeks. But there’s one thing that I absolutely hate and recommend that you get rid of is (immigration) My kingdom that i just started in I’m around 1 mil has been flooded with people from different kingdoms. Yes it brings fun and etc but when three different alliances do it , it messes up a lot of things. A lot of my friends and people I’ve met off this game quit because these alliances decimated new beginning one and other alliances from the same kingdom. Today passes open and only one of the original alliances got a pass. This concept can really ruin a lot of players fun for the game. Especially alliance hopping and etc it just ruins a lot of things for people who are still learning about the game. You should really consider fixing the immigration system and maybe trying something else new or just throw it out the window. Like I mean the second our kingdom opened up to immigration it was taken over. All aside from that this game is decent. It’s fun addicting but you can ruin a lot of people fun by doing that. Or putting newer players into kingdoms that have already started and are almost finished. It’s disappointing honestly how the rewarding system honors cheap play. Good day to you devs I’m not mad and I’ll still play I’m just disappointed.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Greetings Governor, thanks for your feedback. For the situation you faced, we suggest you communicate with that alliance. If your alliance members need to through the pass, you can attack and through it, and don&#39;t send assist troops in it. Other event rewards or territory-related problems, you also could have a discussion and make a decision. We&#39;re constantly improving the game to bring you a better gameplay experience and you are welcome to put forward your opinion. We&#39;re glad to hear it. We wish you a nice day! Best wishes! CS- Rachel</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So I don’t usually write a review but I needed to write one so I love this game  I play 2-3 hours a day or all day and my family think it’s weird of me playing for that long and I usually play for 25 minutes each day but I play more than that on this game I have had it for a year now and it’s amazing and I love everything but there are a few things that I don’t like but it’s not a big deal so number 1. When you train your troops it also takes away your wood and food and I really don’t like that but like I said before it’s not a big deal. Number 2. I don’t like how you have to wait a lot on updating your castle like you have to wait at least 30 days or more  and went your going to level 11 on your castle you have to wait a day for that like I don’t think you have to wait that long just to upgrade. Number 3. I know for a fact that a lot of people will agree with this and it’s editing your space so I know people like doing that but like once you are done like it won’t let you because you have to finish your lay out let’s just call it like that and it has happened a lot I would really appreciate it if you would fix that. Number 4. I really don’t like how you have to be at level 8 and up to attack I really think you should be at level 7 and up but rather than that I think you should download this game it’s really fun  and I love playing it thank you for reading my review have a nice day ❤️</p>

    Great Game but.....

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Honestly probably the most well developed free game I have ever played only thing about it is it is very easy for players to put to win. I’ve been playing the game for about a year or so. So there is a lot to do and plenty of content and events but if your alliance doesn’t have what is known as a whale or two you’re pretty much screwed. So players that appreciate the game and how it has been developed really get screwed over. I understand the need for in game purchases as it is a free to play game but when the whole game is based around a competitive multiplayer world where everyone is racing to get troop tier five anyone who is able to drop hundreds to thousands of dollars on the game are able to dominate the servers and can switch between them. God forbid that one alliance consists of all of the whales in the server that entire server would become unplayable. And for those of you still confused as to what a whale is it’s someone who pays to be months ahead of everyone else so that way they can essentially one hit you or dominate the world without fear. If the developers would just slowly but surely shift the purchases to purely cosmetic the game would be 100x better. Or even make the vip system account based as opposed to character based. Understand the game is very dynamic and ever changing just be wary of the pay to win system</p>

These supplies are only open to kingdoms that are undergoing or have passed the “Eve of the Crusade” from Lost Kingdom Season 1 when this event begins.\n6) Improved a bug in the Power rating of certain equipment with special talents.\n7) Improved the underlying algorithm for Season of Conquest Imperium Kingdoms, linking Imperium Kingdom numbers with the number of kingdoms entering Season of Conquest.\n8) Added a new “Master And Commander” achievement category, the completion of which series will earn an abundant reward.","releaseDate":"2021-08-12"},{"versionDisplay":"1.0.48.30","releaseNotes":" 1. “The Lost Kingdom: March of the Ages” Coming Soon.\n Conflict and war is not simply confined to the old clash of barbarism versus civilization. We fight to recover our ancestors’ legacy from the barbarians but know that wisdom, deception, and trickery come with more advanced civilization too. Thus we exercise utmost caution in all affairs. Our hopes fall to the Ancient Pagodas now and the coming dawn. The only question is: when that moment comes, will we meet the morning sun or arrows at dawn?\n Kingdoms participating in the Season of Conquest now have the opportunity to experience a whole new Story: “March of the Ages”! Governors are no longer able to move wherever they please in this new mode, but must instead “trek” to victory by carefully planning their base, sphere of influence, and army to seize the momentum!\n 1) Super large maps: “March of the Ages” maps are twice the size of any other Story maps.\n 2) Ancient Pagodas: Governors are no longer free to move their cities wherever they will, and must first establish a Foundation Stone around an Ancient Pagoda under their control to move cities.\n 3) Forward Camps: Governors can establish Forward Camps at the “front lines”, which are critically important structures for healing troops and supplying reinforcements. Governors’ careful placement of their Forward Camps will contribute significantly to victory on this map.\n 4) The Supply Radius: The Supply Radius is an area centered around a Governor’s city or Forward Camps for garrisoned troops, and hugely impacts your troops’ ability to do damage. Governors should try to limit their engagements to within the Supply Radius as much as possible to ensure troops can continue to deal full damage.\n 5) Derelict Passes: the map is scattered with abandoned passes so derelict as to be impossible to control or traverse. This throws a chaotic element into the mix for every kingdom at the beginning as each faces a different set of strategic choices and Governors must proactively plan and discuss how to overcome such challenges.\n \n 2. “Champions of Olympia” improvements\n “Champions of Olympia” was a hit with many Governors, and we received a lot of good suggestions. We’ve taken a hard look and made the following optimizations in this update:\n 1) We have modified the colors over Governor’s troops on the Champions of Olympia battlefield, in favor of an intuitive red, blue, and green system to mark enemy, ally, and your own troops.\n 2) Governors can tap to like and befriend other Governors from the results screen.\n 3) Spawn Zones now have shorter recovery times versus Replenishment Points.\n 4) Governors can now tap and hold over an empty space on the battlefield to command their troops to march there.\n 5) Governors can tap the map in the top right corner to issue Mark orders.\n 6) The power of damaging skills on the battlefield will now change with the strength of the casting troops.\n \n 3.

Commander Updates\n 1) To give all Governors more control over the order in which they level up their commanders’ skills, we have added a skill lock function. At the same time, within two days of the update, we will give all governors a limited number of “Skill Reset” items to ensure everyone can take advantage of this new function. We will be sending out a separate announcement with more specifics about this new function and these skill reset items. Keep an eye on your inbox!\n 2) We fixed an error for Frederick I’s passive skill “Invasion” at level 4. Once fixed, the description and effects will match. We will be sending out another announcement with more details in the near future.\n \n 2. Other Optimizations\n 1) We have received numerous complaints from Governors about problems such as lag when many troops are on the screen at the same time. As a result, we are adding a new graphics option to the settings menu that should generally improve your gaming experience when a larger number of players are fighting together.\n 2) We have added an explanation of the chance to forge special talent equipment to the forging system description. Governors should now be able to make better-informed decisions about how to invest their materials. Please note that we have only added a description, and have not made any changes to the chance.\n 3) Added more commander support skills to “Heroic Anthem” in Lost Kingdom: Season of Conquest.\n 4) You can now view camp information in the “Eve of the Crusade” event of Lost Kingdom: Season of Conquest.\n 5) You can now view information on Governors who are not part of your alliance by tapping their troops on the map.\n 6) A special notice has been added for when your troops are being attacked, but are not fighting back.\n 7) To allow Governors to enjoy a wide variety of city themes, active limited-time themes will not expire when a new theme is used, and can be used again during its duration.\n 8) Optimized the calculation method for “Imperium Kingdoms”. Troops in the Hall of Heroes will now be returned at the end of the Season of Conquest regardless of whether or not the Governor is online.\n 9) To ensure Governors’ basic gathering needs are met, we have added a siege unit zone in addition to the hospital, which will allow a number of siege units to be healed without impacting hospital capacity.\n 10) Added a new “star characters” feature to the character management screen. Governors can now more conveniently manage their multiple characters.\n 11) In order to make managing member applications easier, the alliance leader and officers can now go to Settings \u003e Notifications \u003e Approval Reports in their profile and set a minimum power level. When applicants meet the set requirements, they will receive a notification message.\n 12) Added a number of alliance symbols for Governors to choose from. \n 13) Optimized the kill records and ranking calculation methods to better take into account the tier of troops killed.\n 14) The “Deceptive Troops” item’s effect up until now has been too simple, and does not sufficiently confuse opponents. With this in mind, we have changed both the effect and description to add more uncertainty.

For exact details, please see the event page after the update.\n2) Increased the number of teleports earned after the first occupation of an Obelisk from 5 to 8. Teleports can now be used even if troops are not in a building.\n3) Removed the “Divine Aid” skill and adjusted the effects of other skills. Adjusted skill effects will be viewable from the Ark of Osiris page after the update.\n4) Adjusted the rules for occupying buildings. First occupations will now take 3 minutes, and further occupations will take 2 minutes.\n5) Adjusted the rules for gaining Energy Points. Energy Points are now gained faster. Alliances will no longer get a boost to their Energy Points after suffering heavy troop losses, but alliances on the side currently losing will get a boost.\n6) Optimized the Ark of Osiris map display.\n7) Significantly increased the rate at which severely wounded units are healed.\n8) Reduced alliance score earned from caravan visits, but individual score will not be affected.\n\n3. “Lost Kingdom” Optimizations\nAll Seasons:\n1) During the “Eve of the Crusade” event, the gathering speed bonus awarded to the 4th place kingdom has been increased from +5% to +15%.\n2) When a kingdom enters “Eve of the Crusade” for Season 1, the “Resource Reserves” bundle will be replaced with the “Bumper Harvest” bundle.\n \nSeason 2 only:\n1) The Lost Kingdom preparation event will be split into a Preparation stage and a Matchmaking stage. Governors will be unable to immigrate to kingdoms in the Matchmaking stage.\n \nSeason of Conquest only:\n1) Optimized the logic for refreshing Bastion quests to ensure that refreshing will not give the same quest.\n2) Optimized the Bastion window display to include the Bastion’s level.\n3) Lowered the power of Kahar the Hidden.\n4) Reduced the upgrade time required for certain levels of the Crystal Mine and Crystal Research Center, as well as for some Crystal Research Center technologies.\n5) Added crystals to the potential reward pool for defeating barbarians and destroying barbarian forts.\n6) When an alliance joins or leaves a coalition, any ongoing rallies launched by alliance members will now be automatically cancelled.\n \n4.

In order to help governors craft better equipment, we have added more equipment-related rewards, and reduced the number of speedups, while preserving the overall value of each reward tier. At the same time, we have changed some of the “Crusader Achievements” progress requirements. These changes will take effect during the next “Lost Kingdom” season, and will not affect any seasons currently in progress.\n2) We have discovered that in some older kingdoms, power increases come primarily from training troops, but that the growth potential for the power of each troop is actually quite hindered by troop capacity limits. With this in mind, we have optimized the “Lost Kingdom” matchmaking rules. Now governors with power higher than 150 million will be calculated as 150 million for matchmaking purposes. This change will also be applied to calculating power for Imperium Kingdoms.\n3) Added “Bumper Harvest,” a limited-time “Lost Kingdom” super-value resource bundle.\n\n3. “Lost Kingdom - Heroic Anthem” Season Optimizations\n1) Optimized the models for Crystal Mines, Crystal Research Centers, and Bastions to make them more aesthetically pleasing.\n2) Optimized the names of some Crystal Research Center technologies to make them easier to understand.\n3) Optimized the Coalition Honor Points and Camp Honor Points icons to make them more aesthetically pleasing.\n4) The name of “Crusader Fortresses” has been changed in some languages to maintain consistent logic.\n5) Optimized the logic of support skills. Support skills will now work normally regardless of which commander/troop setup has them equipped, but commanders still cannot equip their own skills as support skills.\n\n4. “Golden Kingdom” Event Optimizations\nWe discovered that the “Golden Kingdom” is too hard for some governors, and have made the following adjustments to address that:\n1) Adjusted the event difficulty to be more reasonable. Guardians’ power will now scale with the length of a kingdom’s history.\n2) Adjusted how Healer’s Hut healing works: Now the Healer’s Hut will restore a set amount for all troops.\n3) Adjusted the prices of some relics to be more reasonable.\n4) Optimized the screen for Reinforcement Camps.

This is a fun game I’ve met people etc, and there’s very fun things that I love about this game, I’ve maybe have been playing about a 3-4 weeks. But there’s one thing that I absolutely hate and recommend that you get rid of is (immigration) My kingdom that i just started in I’m around 1 mil has been flooded with people from different kingdoms. Yes it brings fun and etc but when three different alliances do it , it messes up a lot of things. A lot of my friends and people I’ve met off this game quit because these alliances decimated new beginning one and other alliances from the same kingdom. Today passes open and only one of the original alliances got a pass. This concept can really ruin a lot of players fun for the game. Especially alliance hopping and etc it just ruins a lot of things for people who are still learning about the game. You should really consider fixing the immigration system and maybe trying something else new or just throw it out the window. Like I mean the second our kingdom opened up to immigration it was taken over. All aside from that this game is decent. It’s fun addicting but you can ruin a lot of people fun by doing that. Or putting newer players into kingdoms that have already started and are almost finished. It’s disappointing honestly how the rewarding system honors cheap play.

When you train your troops it also takes away your wood and food and I really don’t like that but like I said before it’s not a big deal. Number 2. I don’t like how you have to wait a lot on updating your castle like you have to wait at least 30 days or more  and went your going to level 11 on your castle you have to wait a day for that like I don’t think you have to wait that long just to upgrade. Number 3. I know for a fact that a lot of people will agree with this and it’s editing your space so I know people like doing that but like once you are done like it won’t let you because you have to finish your lay out let’s just call it like that and it has happened a lot I would really appreciate it if you would fix that.

I really don’t like how you have to be at level 8 and up to attack I really think you should be at level 7 and up but rather than that I think you should download this game it’s really fun  and I love playing it thank you for reading my review have a nice day ❤️","title":"I love this game","userName":"clxudy_rose"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6226081086","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-22T01:34:09Z","rating":4,"review":"Honestly probably the most well developed free game I have ever played only thing about it is it is very easy for players to put to win. I’ve been playing the game for about a year or so. So there is a lot to do and plenty of content and events but if your alliance doesn’t have what is known as a whale or two you’re pretty much screwed. So players that appreciate the game and how it has been developed really get screwed over. I understand the need for in game purchases as it is a free to play game but when the whole game is based around a competitive multiplayer world where everyone is racing to get troop tier five anyone who is able to drop hundreds to thousands of dollars on the game are able to dominate the servers and can switch between them. God forbid that one alliance consists of all of the whales in the server that entire server would become unplayable. And for those of you still confused as to what a whale is it’s someone who pays to be months ahead of everyone else so that way they can essentially one hit you or dominate the world without fear. If the developers would just slowly but surely shift the purchases to purely cosmetic the game would be 100x better. Or even make the vip system account based as opposed to character based.

This is not true, the content is typically poorly produced and does not reflect the new in-game content. You form the adds in a way that gives off the illusion that some kingdoms are far superior than others, leading to less diversity in the game because every new player wants to be the best. Now, you do reflect how the basics of how the game works in the adds, so that is something I will credit you for. Although, the content viewed is extremely repetitive, showing nothing new. And the BIGGEST problem, is the amount of advertising for this game. You haven’t shown new content in them, you haven’t shown any reasons this game is better than others, the quality is abominable (lip syncing, animating almost everything so there is limited actual gameplay, stupid situations, repetitive gameplay, and generally irritating “storylines”) If I’ve gotten nearly 80 Rise of Kingdoms advertisements in a week, I probably wouldn’t want to download it.

Then there’s all these big alliances kinda forcing you to be an academy or merge with them that are at 60 million power? Can anyone explain any of this? I also practically made my alliance on the first day but it got up to 14 million and then got wiped out because I wouldn’t merge that’s just not fair they need to put more rules in against bullying little alliances. Also there’s individual people with 16 million power or more in a 27 day kingdom. Also I just saw someone leave an alliance in the kingdom chat saying to his old 61 million power alliance that he’s sorry I’m not into attacking little alliances that are at only 3 million one person from his old alliance said we never did that but then he joins another alliance because I saw his alliance tag change then a few minutes later after saying that he lost his new alliance tag and said I could send him an invite into my new alliance because he doesn’t have one so what I’m saying is if the big powered alliances are really friendly then you saying just one thing and that isn’t that big of a deal and leaving that alliance will cut off youre ties with the other big alliances.","title":"It’s good but can be really unfair","userName":"dont know21"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7388687758","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-05-26T01:32:26Z","developerResponse":{"id":23061879,"body":"Greetings Governor, we always appreciate feedback and suggestions.

You work long and hard to grow your city or alliance and the big ones team together to destroy smaller ones. They sometimes join a weaker alliance to attack another weak alliance and after destroying them they go back to their big alliance. Other times they just attack a smaller alliance directly.  So what’s the point! You think they would just fight each other - big to big instead of big to small.  Instead these big alliances support each other.\n\n In fact some blantantly ask for your credit card or cash to join their alliance and all the developers say is oh we recommend don’t share personal data. The developers don’t tell those alliances that they shouldn’t ask for people’s cash or credit card information to join! So again it’s rigged for big paying customers.\nI’m not opposed to spending a little if you want to speed up a few things but here it does nothing for you because they want you to spend a lot of money. Oh well, that’s fine since they want to earn a ton of money but at least people should know.

The game mechanics are amazing, I love the fog of war idea, and the fact that each commander speaks their native language and not English. And as a Roman and Byzantium history nerd, I love the fact that the Latin in the game is quite decent compared to other games (it isn’t perfect, but that is what you get from a dead language that doesn’t translate well into other languages).\n\nNow, I feel like the nations to choose from is very limiting. From a game about the ancient and medieval ages, Africa and the Middle East were left out, and they have some of the richest history during that time, from the African Empires that rose to power all the way to the Persian empire and the crusades.\n\nSpecifically, I would like to see three more nations added: Ethiopia, Egypt, and Persia. Ethiopia rose to power after the fall of the Roman Empire and remained a powerful nation until after WW2. Persia created a very advanced civilization that grew strong and powerful and became one of the largest empires until the greeks conquered it. Then the Persian Empire reformed itself as the Sassanian Empire and conquered the remaining Romans and Byzantines to form the Ottoman Empire. I do not know much on the history of Egypt, but as one of the first powerful civilizations in human history, it should be obvious why they should be added into the game.","title":"Really great game, but not complete","userName":"DJWicki"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4589553241","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-08-09T06:39:47Z","developerResponse":{"id":10103302,"body":"Greetings Governor, after the activity was abnormal, some players obtained a large amount of illegal Osiris coins and used them to exchange the props.

Significant , but not really that competitive over all. I am being held back by the need for gems that require real money to make any significant difference. Meanwhile, as others note, there are players who spend thousands of dollars and therefore have the ability, and sometimes the temperament, to flatten any in their way. I had quit an earlier game because of one such player and have had 3 teammates quit just this week in current kingdom because of this. Some of the events, like mighty governor, are always won by the high dollar p2w. It is no longer competitive nor fun so I no longer even try to earn a spot; I just cower in my city during KE. There needs to be a threshold for the p2w folks.

I want to say that I have mixed feelings about this app. I’ll start with that this game is really well built. The graphics, the idea, and the system in game is set up good. I like a lot about it. But, if I could change one thing or even have a compromise. My one wish that I wish I could see is the game to release pure f2p kingdoms but you must pay to get in (something like $5-$10 for entry) and once you are in. There is no p2w elements. No micro transactions. Everyone is on fair playing grounds at the start. If that could be added to the game. I feel like that this game will take over the genre and be over the top because to players, that won’t seem like much money to enter and they can test the game out on the kingdom servers we have now to see if they actually like the game itself and from these reviews. People really like the game but not the p2w aspect. The p2w aspect is bringing it down heavily and players are leaving because of it. I myself am not returning to the game till something changes to where there is no p2w aspects or there is an option to what I proposed with the f2p kingdoms being available, but with a entry fee. I feel like that is a fair compromise where the players get what they want and the company still makes a lot of money.

Governors are no longer able to move wherever they please in this new mode, but must instead “trek” to victory by carefully planning their base, sphere of influence, and army to seize the momentum!\n 1) Super large maps: “March of the Ages” maps are twice the size of any other Story maps.\n 2) Ancient Pagodas: Governors are no longer free to move their cities wherever they will, and must first establish a Foundation Stone around an Ancient Pagoda under their control to move cities.\n 3) Forward Camps: Governors can establish Forward Camps at the “front lines”, which are critically important structures for healing troops and supplying reinforcements. Governors’ careful placement of their Forward Camps will contribute significantly to victory on this map.\n 4) The Supply Radius: The Supply Radius is an area centered around a Governor’s city or Forward Camps for garrisoned troops, and hugely impacts your troops’ ability to do damage. Governors should try to limit their engagements to within the Supply Radius as much as possible to ensure troops can continue to deal full damage.\n 5) Derelict Passes: the map is scattered with abandoned passes so derelict as to be impossible to control or traverse. This throws a chaotic element into the mix for every kingdom at the beginning as each faces a different set of strategic choices and Governors must proactively plan and discuss how to overcome such challenges.\n \n 2. “Champions of Olympia” improvements\n “Champions of Olympia” was a hit with many Governors, and we received a lot of good suggestions. We’ve taken a hard look and made the following optimizations in this update:\n 1) We have modified the colors over Governor’s troops on the Champions of Olympia battlefield, in favor of an intuitive red, blue, and green system to mark enemy, ally, and your own troops.\n 2) Governors can tap to like and befriend other Governors from the results screen.\n 3) Spawn Zones now have shorter recovery times versus Replenishment Points.\n 4) Governors can now tap and hold over an empty space on the battlefield to command their troops to march there.\n 5) Governors can tap the map in the top right corner to issue Mark orders.\n 6) The power of damaging skills on the battlefield will now change with the strength of the casting troops.\n \n 3.

Commander Updates\n 1) To give all Governors more control over the order in which they level up their commanders’ skills, we have added a skill lock function. At the same time, within two days of the update, we will give all governors a limited number of “Skill Reset” items to ensure everyone can take advantage of this new function. We will be sending out a separate announcement with more specifics about this new function and these skill reset items. Keep an eye on your inbox!\n 2) We fixed an error for Frederick I’s passive skill “Invasion” at level 4. Once fixed, the description and effects will match. We will be sending out another announcement with more details in the near future.\n \n 2. Other Optimizations\n 1) We have received numerous complaints from Governors about problems such as lag when many troops are on the screen at the same time. As a result, we are adding a new graphics option to the settings menu that should generally improve your gaming experience when a larger number of players are fighting together.\n 2) We have added an explanation of the chance to forge special talent equipment to the forging system description. Governors should now be able to make better-informed decisions about how to invest their materials. Please note that we have only added a description, and have not made any changes to the chance.\n 3) Added more commander support skills to “Heroic Anthem” in Lost Kingdom: Season of Conquest.\n 4) You can now view camp information in the “Eve of the Crusade” event of Lost Kingdom: Season of Conquest.\n 5) You can now view information on Governors who are not part of your alliance by tapping their troops on the map.\n 6) A special notice has been added for when your troops are being attacked, but are not fighting back.\n 7) To allow Governors to enjoy a wide variety of city themes, active limited-time themes will not expire when a new theme is used, and can be used again during its duration.\n 8) Optimized the calculation method for “Imperium Kingdoms”. Troops in the Hall of Heroes will now be returned at the end of the Season of Conquest regardless of whether or not the Governor is online.\n 9) To ensure Governors’ basic gathering needs are met, we have added a siege unit zone in addition to the hospital, which will allow a number of siege units to be healed without impacting hospital capacity.\n 10) Added a new “star characters” feature to the character management screen. Governors can now more conveniently manage their multiple characters.\n 11) In order to make managing member applications easier, the alliance leader and officers can now go to Settings \u003e Notifications \u003e Approval Reports in their profile and set a minimum power level. When applicants meet the set requirements, they will receive a notification message.\n 12) Added a number of alliance symbols for Governors to choose from. \n 13) Optimized the kill records and ranking calculation methods to better take into account the tier of troops killed.\n 14) The “Deceptive Troops” item’s effect up until now has been too simple, and does not sufficiently confuse opponents. With this in mind, we have changed both the effect and description to add more uncertainty. We hope this item’s new design will provide more avenues for strategy going forward.","releaseDate":"2021-04-12"},{"versionDisplay":"1.0.44.21","releaseNotes":" 1.

Win great prizes like a limited-edition city theme and decorations!\n-New Year’s Gifts: Collect Colored Papers to use in the “Lanterns of Togetherness” event.\n-Arms Training: Challenge an Armsmaster Lohar who gets stronger with each battle!

As you help the villagers, you may find things are not as simple as they seem...\n\nSee the Event Calendar for a detailed schedule.\n\n2. “Ark of Osiris” Optimizations\nIn order to ensure Governors can have the battles of their dreams, to make room for more tactics and skill expression, and to bring the fun of Ark of Osiris to even more Governors, we will be making the following adjustments:\n1) In order to allow more alliances to participate without making significant changes to the current rules, alliances that are not in the top 20 of their kingdom will now be able to take part in Ark of Osiris, grouped separately with other alliances of similar power levels. For exact details, please see the event page after the update.\n2) Increased the number of teleports earned after the first occupation of an Obelisk from 5 to 8. Teleports can now be used even if troops are not in a building.\n3) Removed the “Divine Aid” skill and adjusted the effects of other skills. Adjusted skill effects will be viewable from the Ark of Osiris page after the update.\n4) Adjusted the rules for occupying buildings. First occupations will now take 3 minutes, and further occupations will take 2 minutes.\n5) Adjusted the rules for gaining Energy Points. Energy Points are now gained faster. Alliances will no longer get a boost to their Energy Points after suffering heavy troop losses, but alliances on the side currently losing will get a boost.\n6) Optimized the Ark of Osiris map display.\n7) Significantly increased the rate at which severely wounded units are healed.\n8) Reduced alliance score earned from caravan visits, but individual score will not be affected.\n\n3. “Lost Kingdom” Optimizations\nAll Seasons:\n1) During the “Eve of the Crusade” event, the gathering speed bonus awarded to the 4th place kingdom has been increased from +5% to +15%.\n2) When a kingdom enters “Eve of the Crusade” for Season 1, the “Resource Reserves” bundle will be replaced with the “Bumper Harvest” bundle.\n \nSeason 2 only:\n1) The Lost Kingdom preparation event will be split into a Preparation stage and a Matchmaking stage. Governors will be unable to immigrate to kingdoms in the Matchmaking stage.\n \nSeason of Conquest only:\n1) Optimized the logic for refreshing Bastion quests to ensure that refreshing will not give the same quest.\n2) Optimized the Bastion window display to include the Bastion’s level.\n3) Lowered the power of Kahar the Hidden.\n4) Reduced the upgrade time required for certain levels of the Crystal Mine and Crystal Research Center, as well as for some Crystal Research Center technologies.\n5) Added crystals to the potential reward pool for defeating barbarians and destroying barbarian forts.\n6) When an alliance joins or leaves a coalition, any ongoing rallies launched by alliance members will now be automatically cancelled.\n \n4.

At the same time, equipment-related rewards have been added to help Governors get equipment for their commanders faster.\n1) Adjusted the duration of the first two seasons of “Lost Kingdom” to 49 days each.\n2) Lowered the requirements of some “Crusader Achievements”, and added equipment-related rewards.\n3) Decreased the duration of each stage in “Eve of the Crusade” from three days to two days.\n4) Adjusted the reward drops of Kingdom Supply Chests and added more equipment-related rewards.\n5) Added equipment material rewards to the possible reward drops from defeating barbarians and marauders.\n\n3. “Lost Kingdom: Season of Conquest” Optimizations\nWe continue to optimize the Season of Conquest in order to offer a richer experience for Governors who have already been through 3 seasons.\n1) Added a new Story: “Strife of the Eight”, featuring a modified version of the classic season 2 map, with some special content added in from the Season of Conquest! Among 8 camps, who will reign supreme? Sign up for the event, and it might be you!\n2) Optimized the Bastion Commander quest system. You can now give up on accepted quests.\n3) Optimized the unlocking process for support skills in “Lost Kingdom: Heroic Anthem”. Once you meet the unlock conditions, you can directly unlock the corresponding support skill in the support skill menu.\n4) Optimized map elements, adding caves and villages which can be explored by scouts once the fog concealing them has been revealed (will not appear in seasons already in progress).\n5) Added a cross-server View Bastion feature. You can now see the status of Bastions in other Lost Kingdoms.\n6) Optimized some screens to make them simpler and more intuitive.\n7) Optimized some sound effects.\n\n4.

In order to help governors craft better equipment, we have added more equipment-related rewards, and reduced the number of speedups, while preserving the overall value of each reward tier. At the same time, we have changed some of the “Crusader Achievements” progress requirements. These changes will take effect during the next “Lost Kingdom” season, and will not affect any seasons currently in progress.\n2) We have discovered that in some older kingdoms, power increases come primarily from training troops, but that the growth potential for the power of each troop is actually quite hindered by troop capacity limits. With this in mind, we have optimized the “Lost Kingdom” matchmaking rules. Now governors with power higher than 150 million will be calculated as 150 million for matchmaking purposes. This change will also be applied to calculating power for Imperium Kingdoms.\n3) Added “Bumper Harvest,” a limited-time “Lost Kingdom” super-value resource bundle.\n\n3. “Lost Kingdom - Heroic Anthem” Season Optimizations\n1) Optimized the models for Crystal Mines, Crystal Research Centers, and Bastions to make them more aesthetically pleasing.\n2) Optimized the names of some Crystal Research Center technologies to make them easier to understand.\n3) Optimized the Coalition Honor Points and Camp Honor Points icons to make them more aesthetically pleasing.\n4) The name of “Crusader Fortresses” has been changed in some languages to maintain consistent logic.\n5) Optimized the logic of support skills. Support skills will now work normally regardless of which commander/troop setup has them equipped, but commanders still cannot equip their own skills as support skills.\n\n4. “Golden Kingdom” Event Optimizations\nWe discovered that the “Golden Kingdom” is too hard for some governors, and have made the following adjustments to address that:\n1) Adjusted the event difficulty to be more reasonable. Guardians’ power will now scale with the length of a kingdom’s history.\n2) Adjusted how Healer’s Hut healing works: Now the Healer’s Hut will restore a set amount for all troops.\n3) Adjusted the prices of some relics to be more reasonable.\n4) Optimized the screen for Reinforcement Camps.
