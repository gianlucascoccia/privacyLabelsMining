I’m too tired… I forgot… etc. Routinist eliminates these excuses for me.\n\nBecoming a better you is hard. It requires motivation, planning, commitment and execution. Only you can keep yourself motivated and committed over the long term. The purpose of Routinist is to help with the planning and execution parts, so you can improve your health, achieve your goals, and continue becoming a better you.\n\n***HOW***\n\nStep 1: List your typical morning routine actions and estimate time for each action. This can be super simple (get ready for day for 45 mins), or as detailed as you like (floss 1m, brush 3m , shower 10m, shave 5m, etc.).\n\nStep 2: Enter your desired sleep and Go Time (the time you need to leave for work).\n\nStep 3: Add new actions (those small steps towards your goals like flossing or exercising) and their estimated time, and insert them into your routine.\n\nRoutinist uses this info to remind you when to wake up and go to bed so you have time for your routines and get the sleep you need. Take action during the time you most control: your mornings and evenings. Routinist removes the ‘when’ so you can focus on the ‘what’.\n\n***WHAT***\n\n• Build morning (and evening!) routines\n• Wake up and bed time reminders\n• Understand your time constraints and prioritize\n• Reduce decision fatigue\n• Routines sync with your Apple Calendar!\n• Optimize your routine: tweak the time, order and frequency of actions for any routine any time (yes – even during an active routine)\n• Complete actions, skip actions, and undo skip/complete as needed\n• Continuously updated routine completion times\n• Timers &amp; notifications for each action\n• Apple Watch! Complete, Skip, Pause &amp; Resume from the notifications on the Apple Watch or iPhone notification center\n• Flexibility: schedule actions on certain days each week or every x days, x weekdays, etc.\n• Progress Tracking for a birds eye view of your progress\n• Detailed History of every routine \n• Dark Mode\n• 120+ action ideas with suggested times\n\n***WHO***\n\nYou.\n\nRoutinist is probably very different from any other app you’ve tried, and it takes some getting used to. But I strongly believe this unique approach to achieving your goals will make your life better.\n\n“Anyone can list out their goals, but they will be quickly abandoned without the help of an app like this… No other goal app compares to Routinist. Worth the time to learn.”\n\n“This app enabled me to establish a regular morning routine for the first time in my 45 years of life.”\n\n“If you have different times for leaving to work/school everyday but similar morning tasks this is perfect. It is worth the time to try it.”\n\n\"Your app has enormous potential in helping others reach theirs.\"\n\n***WHEN***\n\nNow!\n\n_______\n\nRoutinist does not advertise and is instead supported by Premium membership through an auto-renewing subscription.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Routinist helps you achieve goals and build habits by scheduling time for them as part of your everyday routines. <br /><br />***WHY***<br /><br />I built Routinist because I got tired of having excuses for why I wasn’t taking action on my goals: I don’t have time... I’m too tired… I forgot… etc. Routinist eliminates these excuses for me.<br /><br />Becoming a better you is hard. It requires motivation, planning, commitment and execution. Only you can keep yourself motivated and committed over the long term. The purpose of Routinist is to help with the planning and execution parts, so you can improve your health, achieve your goals, and continue becoming a better you.<br /><br />***HOW***<br /><br />Step 1: List your typical morning routine actions and estimate time for each action. This can be super simple (get ready for day for 45 mins), or as detailed as you like (floss 1m, brush 3m , shower 10m, shave 5m, etc.).<br /><br />Step 2: Enter your desired sleep and Go Time (the time you need to leave for work).<br /><br />Step 3: Add new actions (those small steps towards your goals like flossing or exercising) and their estimated time, and insert them into your routine.<br /><br />Routinist uses this info to remind you when to wake up and go to bed so you have time for your routines and get the sleep you need. Take action during the time you most control: your mornings and evenings. Routinist removes the ‘when’ so you can focus on the ‘what’.<br /><br />***WHAT***<br /><br />• Build morning (and evening!) routines<br />• Wake up and bed time reminders<br />• Understand your time constraints and prioritize<br />• Reduce decision fatigue<br />• Routines sync with your Apple Calendar!<br />• Optimize your routine: tweak the time, order and frequency of actions for any routine any time (yes – even during an active routine)<br />• Complete actions, skip actions, and undo skip/complete as needed<br />• Continuously updated routine completion times<br />• Timers &amp; notifications for each action<br />• Apple Watch! Complete, Skip, Pause &amp; Resume from the notifications on the Apple Watch or iPhone notification center<br />• Flexibility: schedule actions on certain days each week or every x days, x weekdays, etc.<br />• Progress Tracking for a birds eye view of your progress<br />• Detailed History of every routine <br />• Dark Mode<br />• 120+ action ideas with suggested times<br /><br />***WHO***<br /><br />You.<br /><br />Routinist is probably very different from any other app you’ve tried, and it takes some getting used to. But I strongly believe this unique approach to achieving your goals will make your life better.<br /><br />“Anyone can list out their goals, but they will be quickly abandoned without the help of an app like this… No other goal app compares to Routinist. Worth the time to learn.”<br /><br />“This app enabled me to establish a regular morning routine for the first time in my 45 years of life.”<br /><br />“If you have different times for leaving to work/school everyday but similar morning tasks this is perfect. It is worth the time to try it.”<br /><br />&quot;Your app has enormous potential in helping others reach theirs.&quot;<br /><br />***WHEN***<br /><br />Now!<br /><br />_______<br /><br />Routinist does not advertise and is instead supported by Premium membership through an auto-renewing subscription. If you choose to purchase Premium, payments will be charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Can’t even express how much this app has helped me with time management— I have ADHD and it’s so easy for me to lose track of time once I get absorbed into something, which has caused me to be late for as long as I can remember. I’ve been using this app for over 2 years and it’s completely changed me; Before Routinist I would sit on my phone until the absolute last minute that I had to leave for school or work. Now, every day I get up, read, work out, do coding problems, make my bed, plan my day, and get ready before class with time to spare like clockwork—it’s honestly incredible what a few buzzes can prompt you to do and I totally recommend using Routinist even if you don’t have ADHD. I’m never late for class anymore (it’s great that you can set each day to start at a different time, since I have class at various times every day) and it even takes the work out of calculating the time of when I need to go to bed. While the interface might not seem the most intuitive to begin with, once you get used to it you can never go back.</p>

    Cautiously Optimistic

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Update: I think I’ve got it figured out. After several more days of not being able to open the app without it crashing and with no update or way to ask for help in sight I decided to delete and reinstall the app. It seems to have worked but I lost my carefully created and fine tuned routine. I was also worried when I reinstalled because it was saying the only option if you want to have more than 15 actions between your morning and evening routines is to pay a couple bucks a month for Premium, but last year I paid for Premium as a one-time, in-app purchase. I was able to restore my purchase and it appears I can start adding actions back in. I’m cautiously optimistic, but I’ll be watching to see if it starts crashing again, or if it tries to charge a monthly fee. My guess about the crashing is it had something to do with the new subscription format? I wish this all would have somehow been communicated! Upping review to three stars, will fix it again as I see how things go.<br /><br />Original: I actually love this app but for days now it has been crashing every time I open it. No update in sight and I could be wrong but I don’t think there is any way to reach out to the developer. I’m hoping this one star review will get their attention! Then I’ll fix my review.</p>

    Fantastic for Time Challenged People
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’m thrilled an app like this exists - I know it’s not something that most people need, but when time management is your weakness, it’s an absolute must. The interface is extremely user friendly, and it doesn’t require as much calibration as I’d expect, which is fantastic. The only reason I’ve given it four stars instead of five is because I would really like to see more done with the “Other Routines” portion of the app. It’s premium users only, and I expected it to be as good as the morning and evening routines - it’s almost there but not quite. They don’t reset (I think this is a bug, because apparently my notifications think that the routine is going, so I get notifications to do things but no way to check them off) so my “Leaving Work” routine is literally only useful the once. [edit: you have to manually reset them, long press the start button and it will clear the routine] I’d also love to see a way to remind you to use other routines - a way to set a notification for certain days. Other than that, it’s pretty close to perfect. Great job developer, and thanks for making such a brilliant app!</p>

I’m too tired… I forgot… etc. Routinist eliminates these excuses for me.\n\nBecoming a better you is hard. It requires motivation, planning, commitment and execution. Only you can keep yourself motivated and committed over the long term. The purpose of Routinist is to help with the planning and execution parts, so you can improve your health, achieve your goals, and continue becoming a better you.\n\n***HOW***\n\nStep 1: List your typical morning routine actions and estimate time for each action. This can be super simple (get ready for day for 45 mins), or as detailed as you like (floss 1m, brush 3m , shower 10m, shave 5m, etc.).\n\nStep 2: Enter your desired sleep and Go Time (the time you need to leave for work).\n\nStep 3: Add new actions (those small steps towards your goals like flossing or exercising) and their estimated time, and insert them into your routine.\n\nRoutinist uses this info to remind you when to wake up and go to bed so you have time for your routines and get the sleep you need. Take action during the time you most control: your mornings and evenings. Routinist removes the ‘when’ so you can focus on the ‘what’.\n\n***WHAT***\n\n• Build morning (and evening!) routines\n• Wake up and bed time reminders\n• Understand your time constraints and prioritize\n• Reduce decision fatigue\n• Routines sync with your Apple Calendar!\n• Optimize your routine: tweak the time, order and frequency of actions for any routine any time (yes – even during an active routine)\n• Complete actions, skip actions, and undo skip/complete as needed\n• Continuously updated routine completion times\n• Timers \u0026 notifications for each action\n• Apple Watch! Complete, Skip, Pause \u0026 Resume from the notifications on the Apple Watch or iPhone notification center\n• Flexibility: schedule actions on certain days each week or every x days, x weekdays, etc.\n• Progress Tracking for a birds eye view of your progress\n• Detailed History of every routine \n• Dark Mode\n• 120+ action ideas with suggested times\n\n***WHO***\n\nYou.\n\nRoutinist is probably very different from any other app you’ve tried, and it takes some getting used to. But I strongly believe this unique approach to achieving your goals will make your life better.\n\n“Anyone can list out their goals, but they will be quickly abandoned without the help of an app like this… No other goal app compares to Routinist. Worth the time to learn.”\n\n“This app enabled me to establish a regular morning routine for the first time in my 45 years of life.”\n\n“If you have different times for leaving to work/school everyday but similar morning tasks this is perfect. It is worth the time to try it.”\n\n\"Your app has enormous potential in helping others reach theirs.\"\n\n***WHEN***\n\nNow!\n\n_______\n\nRoutinist does not advertise and is instead supported by Premium membership through an auto-renewing subscription. If you choose to purchase Premium, payments will be charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

I’ve been using this app for over 2 years and it’s completely changed me; Before Routinist I would sit on my phone until the absolute last minute that I had to leave for school or work. Now, every day I get up, read, work out, do coding problems, make my bed, plan my day, and get ready before class with time to spare like clockwork—it’s honestly incredible what a few buzzes can prompt you to do and I totally recommend using Routinist even if you don’t have ADHD. I’m never late for class anymore (it’s great that you can set each day to start at a different time, since I have class at various times every day) and it even takes the work out of calculating the time of when I need to go to bed.

After several more days of not being able to open the app without it crashing and with no update or way to ask for help in sight I decided to delete and reinstall the app. It seems to have worked but I lost my carefully created and fine tuned routine. I was also worried when I reinstalled because it was saying the only option if you want to have more than 15 actions between your morning and evening routines is to pay a couple bucks a month for Premium, but last year I paid for Premium as a one-time, in-app purchase. I was able to restore my purchase and it appears I can start adding actions back in. I’m cautiously optimistic, but I’ll be watching to see if it starts crashing again, or if it tries to charge a monthly fee. My guess about the crashing is it had something to do with the new subscription format? I wish this all would have somehow been communicated! Upping review to three stars, will fix it again as I see how things go.\n\nOriginal: I actually love this app but for days now it has been crashing every time I open it.

The only reason I’ve given it four stars instead of five is because I would really like to see more done with the “Other Routines” portion of the app. It’s premium users only, and I expected it to be as good as the morning and evening routines - it’s almost there but not quite. They don’t reset (I think this is a bug, because apparently my notifications think that the routine is going, so I get notifications to do things but no way to check them off) so my “Leaving Work” routine is literally only useful the once. [edit: you have to manually reset them, long press the start button and it will clear the routine] I’d also love to see a way to remind you to use other routines - a way to set a notification for certain days. Other than that, it’s pretty close to perfect.

I used to have a note that told me what tasks to do in the morning and before bed and this is just a huge upgrade for me. It automatically calculates the time and starts the next activity and I can skip items. It’s just made the start of my day so much better I feel happier and more focused when I get to work in the morning because I know that everything has been going well In the day so far. It also helps me relax and sleep better at night knowing everything is done for the day. My house is more organized since I have a daily task to do the dishes and pick up. I love that it calculates what time you should start your night routine and when you need to go to bed and I love that it calculates when you should wake up in the morning in order to leave the house in time. This app has kept me from getting distracted on Facebook for example in the morning when critical test need to get done I’m just so happy this is my favorite app on my phone.

It is perfect for organizing your morning and evening habits/routine, and keeping track of what actions you are completing each week. The app is a little confusing to get the hang of at first BUT the developer (Tim) is VERY responsive and super helpful!! Routinist has really helped me create and practice a solid am/pm routine that I was really struggling with before the app. Routinist has unique alarms that go off whenever your routines should START, that way you have enough time to complete the routine and still be able to go to bed or leave for work ON TIME! Routinist will ask you what time you wish to leave in the morning by, and how many of hours of sleep you want, so then depending on how long your am/pm routines take (which YOU create/add in what actions you would like completed each night or morning), the app will then let you know when you should be in bed in order to get that full nights rest and leave on time in the morning!!","title":"WORTH IT!","userName":"rae.storms"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3899182259","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-03-19T05:27:52Z","rating":4,"review":"Really like the app and plan to use it regularly moving forward.

I appreciate the simple design, but if the team is looking to update it, it would be nice to have more flexibility with timer functions, allowing you to time multiple tasks at once. Otherwise, I’m finding that tasks are not accurately logged if I leave it running too long for one task, complete a 2nd task in the mean time, then get the entire time automatically applies for the 2nd task. For sake of review, it would be nice to be able to go back and edit the actual times that the tasks were completed during.

One of my favorite things about it is that it helps me to really see how much time I realistically need for my morning and evening routines and how that impacts when I need to start getting ready for bed.  It takes the guesswork out, and I can also then see how good I’ve been at guessing how much time it takes me to do each task.  I tend to underestimate and then get frustrated with myself.  Routinist helps to shift it to learning and I’ve gotten better at my expectations.  It’s super easy to edit when life changes, and I feel a great sense of accomplishment each morning and evening when I get everything done.  It also helps keep me from getting sidetracked into a project or time sinks - like checking my email or reading the news.  Love this app!

It is especially relevant to my productivity as I have ADD (and without it would not remember to brush my hair until the afternoon).\n\nWhat sets this app apart? \n1) Easy to tweak your routine.*\n2) Does not penalize you for skipping aspects of the routine or taking longer or shorter than stated.** \n\nThis plea is directed at you, app developer people. Please make an app with the above qualifications that isn’t just for the morning. Having flexible, easily-reference-able routines is essential for people with ADHD (and I assume everyone else, but I don’t think they need supports to remember what they were supposed to be doing 5 minutes ago). It would be even better if you kept all of these routines in one location.\n\nThank you!\n\n*Before this app, I used a paper checklist posted on my bathroom wall. When I wanted to change the included tasks I had to erase the entire list. The problem with a list that doesn’t reflect real life is that you begin to ignore it. Being able to easily edit, the routine stays relevant. \n**surprisingly rare- apps usually either rush you into the next task when you're not done, and/or give you a red X when you fail to complete a task.

Planning a party and have a certain time I’m picking someone up then continuing on.  Even better is to have some sort of stop at that point where it starts over again to the next due time - if that makes sense.

I’m too tired… I forgot… etc. Routinist eliminates these excuses for me.\n\nBecoming a better you is hard. It requires motivation, planning, commitment and execution. Only you can keep yourself motivated and committed over the long term. The purpose of Routinist is to help with the planning and execution parts, so you can improve your health, achieve your goals, and continue becoming a better you.\n\n***HOW***\n\nStep 1: List your typical morning routine actions and estimate time for each action. This can be super simple (get ready for day for 45 mins), or as detailed as you like (floss 1m, brush 3m , shower 10m, shave 5m, etc.).\n\nStep 2: Enter your desired sleep and Go Time (the time you need to leave for work).\n\nStep 3: Add new actions (those small steps towards your goals like flossing or exercising) and their estimated time, and insert them into your routine.\n\nRoutinist uses this info to remind you when to wake up and go to bed so you have time for your routines and get the sleep you need. Take action during the time you most control: your mornings and evenings. Routinist removes the ‘when’ so you can focus on the ‘what’.\n\n***WHAT***\n\n• Build morning (and evening!) routines\n• Wake up and bed time reminders\n• Understand your time constraints and prioritize\n• Reduce decision fatigue\n• Routines sync with your Apple Calendar!\n• Optimize your routine: tweak the time, order and frequency of actions for any routine any time (yes – even during an active routine)\n• Complete actions, skip actions, and undo skip/complete as needed\n• Continuously updated routine completion times\n• Timers \u0026 notifications for each action\n• Apple Watch! Complete, Skip, Pause \u0026 Resume from the notifications on the Apple Watch or iPhone notification center\n• Flexibility: schedule actions on certain days each week or every x days, x weekdays, etc.\n• Progress Tracking for a birds eye view of your progress\n• Detailed History of every routine \n• Dark Mode\n• 120+ action ideas with suggested times\n\n***WHO***\n\nYou.\n\nRoutinist is probably very different from any other app you’ve tried, and it takes some getting used to. But I strongly believe this unique approach to achieving your goals will make your life better.\n\n“Anyone can list out their goals, but they will be quickly abandoned without the help of an app like this… No other goal app compares to Routinist. Worth the time to learn.”\n\n“This app enabled me to establish a regular morning routine for the first time in my 45 years of life.”\n\n“If you have different times for leaving to work/school everyday but similar morning tasks this is perfect. It is worth the time to try it.”\n\n\"Your app has enormous potential in helping others reach theirs.\"\n\n***WHEN***\n\nNow!\n\n_______\n\nRoutinist does not advertise and is instead supported by Premium membership through an auto-renewing subscription.
