        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have had this app for a while and thought by now they would have improved it. Watching my reality shows on here is painful sometimes. I have actually rewatched shows on my tv after I had already watched here and realized somehow I missed a whole section of the show. There have been times that I will be watching and for no reason the episode will just start over. Plus most of the time (not all but most) if you leave the app then go back in, it jumps back to the beginning of your episode and you have to scroll through to figure out where you left off. The episodes start from new to old but if you are watching episode 3 it automatically goes to episode 2 when you finish instead of going to 4 which makes no sense at all. The commercials are terrible and repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat. I understand we have to watch them in order to get the free app but they could at least be normal commercials that you see on TV. Some of these look like my children produced them. I had to sit through 20 seconds of a child swimming and doing flips in a pool with no words, no promoting, nothing. Umm ok. Then they promote stores and events all in FL lol. I’m in NJ and can’t figure out how to change the settings. We get it, Ace Hardware pays a lot to promote with VH1! I can’t remove closed caption to save my life which drives me crazy. But you get what you pay for I guess lol thank god for on demand with cable!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Dealing with this app takes up so much of your time just to watch one tv show or one episode. I can start off watching a show, cast it to my tv then boom the sound is off but you can hear other parts of the show playing or a commercial playing over it. The app will be casting the show and it starts to lag. I’m on the beginning of the show but the sound is on the middle of the show. I click a certain episode then it plays another episode I didn’t select to watch. I have to stop casting, close the app, re open the app, find my episode, cast it to the tv, then for what, for me to have to do the steps all over again?! This is absolutely frustrating. It should not take you 30 mins to an hour to get the app to function just to watch one episode or one show. You’re better off just watching vh1 straight from your cable Provider because this app just isn’t it. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled and I’m have the same issues. Then you would expect the next episodes to continue, nope the current episode that you’re watching will play at least 5 times before the app just stops casting. I’m definitely deleting this app because it’s not worth the hassle.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I personally love VH1 and all of the shows that it airs. I personally don’t always have the time to watch my favorite shows live which is why I downloaded the app. I’ve have the app for well over 6 Months and honestly no matter how many times there’s an update the problems never seem to get fixed. Often times in the middle of watching a show the sound will cut off and video will just play on its own, when I try to rewind I get hit with a bunch of commercials I don’t feel like watching. Speaking of commercials, this app plays too many of them &amp; they all seem to be the same exact commercials that honestly gets so tiring. With this new update, if I were to accidentally lock my phone or interrupt the show in any way the entire thing starts over from the beginning and as I fast forward I have to sit through the same boring commercials. You have to have a lot of patients when dealing with this app but truth be told it’s honestly easier to just watch a show live on tv.</p>

(Personal Information and Other Information shall be referred to, together, as \"Information\".)\n\n3.1 Information We Collect that You Provide Us.\n\n3.1.1\tUser Registration; Third Party Social Media Network Sign-On; Single VII Sign-On. If we offer user registration on the Site, to register as a member of the Site, there may be a few options for you to register: Site Registration (as described below), Third Party Social Media Network Sign-On (as described below) and, if you have previously registered on another VII website, application or other interactive service using one of those methods, Single VII Sign-On (as defined and described below) if offered by this Site. In each case, you are required to either use a pre-existing user name and password (together, your \"User ID\") or select a new User ID.\n\n3.1.1.1 Site Registration. For Site registration, you are required to select a User ID and may be required to also provide other Information, such as your email address and date of birth. Additional Information may be requested and/or required during the registration process. After you have registered for the Site under Site Registration, we may recognize you when you visit certain other VII websites, applications or other interactive services across Devices (such as when you login) and permit you to use Single VII Sign-On (as described below) to register for and login on such other websites, applications or other interactive services, but please note that other VII websites, applications or other interactive services may set additional or different requirements for membership, such as minimum age.\n\n3.1.1.2\tThird Party Social Media Network Sign-On. We may provide you with the ability to sign on to the Site by using third party social media network credentials (\"SMN\"). If you choose to sign-in through an SMN, you may be required to provide us with all or some of the Information required in the Site's registration form and your use of the Site shall be governed by the applicable SMN's privacy policy and user agreements as well as this Privacy Policy and the Site's Terms of Use Agreement.

We, and VII, are not responsible for the use of any such SMN, or for the accuracy, use or misuse of any information that you may disclose to or receive from an SMN or other third party in connection with such use. If you use an SMN to sign-in, we may receive certain information from such SMN and our use of your Information we receive from any SMN is governed by the relevant policies of any such SMN and any permissions you give us regarding your Information, including, but not limited to, those set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions about whether a particular feature, function or service of the Site is powered by a third party, you may contact us with your question as provided in Section 12.2 (Questions) below.\n\nAfter you have registered for the Site through SMN, we may recognize you when you visit certain other VII websites, applications or other interactive services and permit you to use Single VII Sign-On (as described below) to register for and login on such other websites, applications or other interactive services.\n\n3.1.1.3\tSingle VII Sign-On.

We may also provide you with access to certain features or functions that we may offer on the Site, such as the option to participate in commenting, shopping and member profile pages. To sign up for or participate in these features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions. For example, if we offer e-Commerce services on this Site, if you order any of our goods or services through such services, in addition to your name and contact information, we (or our operational service providers that we use to provide the e-Commerce service) may also collect and/or maintain your billing address, shipping address, selections, credit card or other payment instrument information, order number and information about your computer's internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (e.g., the referring URL).\n\nThe Site may also provide features, functions and/or services powered by an SMN or other third party. For example, Information may be disclosed to an SMN through plug-ins offered by such SMN (such as Likes, Shares or commenting). Please take care when using any SMN or other third party service and familiarize yourself with the SMN's or other third party's policies and agreements, if any, that govern such use.\n\n3.1.3\tIn Connection with Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.

Additional Information may be requested depending on the specific Promotion. The Promotion's entry page and/or Rules shall provide the specific requirements. You may also have the opportunity to opt-in to receive special Promotions or offers from our third party advertisers, sponsors or promotional partners (\"Advertisers\") as a result of your use of the Site in connection with these Promotions.\n\n3.2 Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.\n\nThe Site and/or third parties may use \"cookies\", \"web beacons\", Flash local shared objects and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, \"Tracking Technologies\") to collect Other Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web. \"Cookies\" are typically html or browser-based text or other files (and often referred to as browser cookies) that help store information, user preferences and/or user activity. \"Web beacons\" (also known as image tags, gif, tracking pixels or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses.  Flash local shared objects (\"LSOs\") (sometimes known as Flash cookies and used if Adobe Flash is used) are text or other files that help store user preferences and/or activity.\n\nThese Tracking Technologies collect \"click stream\" data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site's webpages, type of browser use, type of operating system used, date and time of viewing, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences) or other websites, applications or interactive services. Through these Tracking Technologies, we may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other websites, applications or other interactive services and may also collect or access your IP address (which is automatically assigned to any Device(s) and/or Device and Internet browser combination you use to access the Site) and/or set or access some other identifier unique to the Device(s), Device platform and/or Device-Internet browser combination you use to access the Site (\"Identifier\"). For example, we may set a unique alphanumeric Identifier unique to your home computer on Firefox, or access an Identifier provided by a mobile platform, such as the application or advertising Identifiers offered by Apple. Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may combine any or all of the Other Information we collect using Tracking Technologies and associate it and/or Identifiers with your Personal Information (such as your Single VII Sign-On ID) and/or with other non-personally identifiable unique identifiers assigned by VII or third parties.\n\n3.2.1\tThe Site's Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information.\n\nBy visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge and understand that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site and other websites, applications or interactive services through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you. See Your Choices section below for more information on how you can withdraw your consent for certain purposes.\n\nWe use Tracking Technologies to enable us to collect and then use Information as described in Section 4.2 \"Other Information Collected by Us\" under \"How Is Collected Information Used\" below. For example, we use Tracking Technologies to enable Single VII Sign-On, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times or seeing advertisements too frequently, to tailor your experience on the Site by delivering relevant personalized advertising, email marketing and other content and to record if you have opted out of receiving personalized advertising from us.\n\n3.2.2\tThird Parties' Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information.\n\nThis Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or audience measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, \"Third Party Service Providers\") to, for example, facilitate personalized advertisements (\"Customized Advertising\") and/or other content, serve advertisements on the Site and/or measure and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site.

This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Information that a Third Party Service Provider or Advertiser may directly collect from you.

Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers may collect Other Information about you when you visit this Site for Customized Advertising to help identify products and services that may interest you and deliver advertising and/or other content tailored to your interests.

If you use such opt-out tools, your choices only apply to the Third Party Service Providers identified in such links. Please note that, if third party browser cookies are disabled (whether by you or automatically by the browser or Device) or you subsequently delete browser cookies, the opt-out choices you have exercised may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies or opt out again in order for your opt-out choices to function.\nIn addition to the Third Party Service Providers described above, these and other Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative's Opt-Out Tool and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. For example, click here for more information on some Third Party Service Providers that we use to provide online behavioral advertising, sometimes called personalized advertising or tailored advertising.

With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, you have a number of options:\n\nYou can prevent or exercise choices regarding the use of certain Tracking Technologies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls in your Internet browser as described in \"More Information About Cookie Controls\" section below. Please note that using those controls may affect Tracking Technologies which are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.\nSee the \"More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies\" section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by the Site and for information on your choices regarding Identifiers on mobile platforms.\nThis Site is committed to complying with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Click our Ad Choices link here for more information about this Site and Customized Advertising.\n\nPlease note that if you exercise the Ad Choices opt-out above, that only applies to the use of the data for Customized Advertising and we may still use the data for other purposes described in Section 4.2 \"How is Collected Information Used\" above, such as for video playhead tracking and to optimize your video experience.\n\n5.2.3.\tMore Information on Managing Tracking Technologies. With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, please note the following with respect to the above opt-out options:\n\nYour Choices Regarding the Site's Use of Information for Customized Advertising. You can prevent the Site's use of Information collected through Tracking Technologies for Customized Advertising by exercising the opt-outs offered by Third Party Service Providers we use as described in our Ad Choices link here. Some of your options available in our AdChoices link may opt you out of receiving Customized Advertising across Devices.\nMore Information About Cookie Controls.\nFor the following Internet browsers, you may prevent or exercise choices regarding browser cookies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls described in the following:\nInternet Explorer 11 Chrome\nSafari\nFirefox\nIf your Internet browser is not listed above or you otherwise are having difficulties with the links, you may be able to access controls to:\nDelete existing browser cookies through the \"Internet Options\", \"Settings\", Preferences\", \"Options\" or similar menu selection in your browser's menu or otherwise as directed by your browser's support feature, which means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in the future.\nDisable browser cookies through the same browser controls which means that browser cookies shall not be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted. Additional information on enabling or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser's support feature. (See the \"help\" section of your browser for more information.) Disabling may sometimes be referred to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices. If you delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.\nChoose to have the Device you use to access the Site warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set. (You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.) This may be available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Site. Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser's support feature.\nSeek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser's support features.\nThe above options may cover browser cookies set by the Site, browser cookies not set by the Site (sometimes called third party cookies) and/or both types of browser cookies. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATION OF THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS. ALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS ARE DIFFERENT FROM DO NOT TRACK OPTIONS THAT MAY ALSO BE OFFERED BY CERTAIN BROWSERS.\nMany tools discussed above are \"Internet browser cookie based.\" This means that such tools rely on cookies to remember your choices. For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to re-establish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms described in our Ad Choices link, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through these mechanisms again.\nThe tools are \"Internet browser and Device-specific\" or \"Device-specific\". Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices. This means, for example, that if you block or disable browser cookies for Internet Explorer 9 on one Device, this choice shall not block or disable browser cookies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device or on a different Device using Internet Explorer 9. Further, you may need to separately exercise your options for other platforms, such as mobile platform (as described below). See our Ad Choices link here for more information about this Site and other options you may have regarding Customized Advertising across Devices.\nAutomatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs. Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function. For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.\nYou shall still receive advertisements. Deleting or disabling Third Party Service Providers', Advertisers' or the Site's Tracking Technologies does not mean that you shall no longer receive online ads. If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you shall continue to see ads on this Site and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Site to set Tracking Technologies for frequency capping purposes as described in the \"Information Collected Through the Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies\" section.\nLimitations Regarding Web Beacons. Web beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled Tracking Technologies to track your activities.\nHow to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies). Control of Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies) Must Be Handled Separately. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER. Deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Site through the above options shall not remove Flash LSOs.  For more information about Flash LSOs and how to remove them from your computer, please visit http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html. If you remove Flash LSOs, you may not have access to certain features of the Site and some of our other services may not function properly.\nOther Effects of Managing Tracking Technologies. In addition to the above, if you delete or disable Tracking Technologies set by the Site, the Site may no longer be able to offer certain features or functionality to you, such as remembering your preferences, remembering your username, enabling Single VII Sign-On, saving your player settings or other purposes described in \"Other Information Collected By Us\" above, and some of our other services may not function properly. In addition to the above, if you disable or delete Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers (or if such Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled on your Device or browser), the Site may no longer be able to offer certain functionality to you, such as enabling SMN login or saving your player settings and certain services or advertisements may not work for such Devices or browsers.\nMobile Platforms. Certain mobile platforms, such as Apple or Google, may offer users choice regarding the Identifiers we, Third Party Service Providers or Advertisers may access and use, which may not be browser cookie based. We encourage you to review and understand the choices that such mobile platforms may provide to you regarding these Identifiers.\nCertain Identifiers. Certain Identifiers we set may not be deleted, blocked or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such Identifiers rely on, or are associated with, browser cookies or other Tracking Technologies.\nDo-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit \"do-not-track\" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.\nWe currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals. Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for Customized Advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in this Section 5.2.3 and in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.\n6.

If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of such Personal Information for marketing purposes, you shall need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly and the use of such information by Co-Branded Partner is subject to Co-Branded Partner's privacy policy. Please note that your Information may be shared with Co-Branded Partners for purposes of administering or conducting the co-branded services and features (but not for marketing purposes) without a separate opt in (for example, if the Co-Branded Partner is administering a Promotion you have entered, your Information may be shared with the Co-Branded Partner so that the Co-Branded Partner can verify your eligibility and/or contact you if you are a potential winner).\n\n7.1.4\tDisclosure to Operational Service Providers. We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Site's services, features, functions and operations.

In such cases, we shall provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.\n\n8.5\tChildren or Ineligible Teenagers. If we, or VII, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of the Site or certain features of this Site (\"Ineligible Teenagers\"), the child or Ineligible Teenager, or parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager (the \"Parent\"), may unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message.

We request that our operational service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality.\n\nPhishing. Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account credentials. \"Phishers\" use 'spoofed' emails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites, or otherwise respond in a manner that is, designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers. WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD! If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site's Privacy Administrator at privacy@viacom.com, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.\n\n10. Your California Privacy Rights.\nIf you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with notice and you may choose to disclose your Personal Information to third parties (such as Advertisers) for marketing purposes (see \"Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information\" above).

Flash local shared objects (\"LSOs\") (sometimes known as Flash cookies and used if Adobe Flash is used) are text or other files that help store user preferences and/or activity.\n\nThese Tracking Technologies collect \"click stream\" data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site's webpages, type of browser use, type of operating system used, date and time of viewing, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences) or other websites, applications or interactive services. Through these Tracking Technologies, we may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other websites, applications or other interactive services and may also collect or access your IP address (which is automatically assigned to any Device(s) and/or Device and Internet browser combination you use to access the Site) and/or set or access some other identifier unique to the Device(s), Device platform and/or Device-Internet browser combination you use to access the Site (\"Identifier\"). For example, we may set a unique alphanumeric Identifier unique to your home computer on Firefox, or access an Identifier provided by a mobile platform, such as the application or advertising Identifiers offered by Apple. Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may combine any or all of the Other Information we collect using Tracking Technologies and associate it and/or Identifiers with your Personal Information (such as your Single VII Sign-On ID) and/or with other non-personally identifiable unique identifiers assigned by VII or third parties.\n\n3.2.1\tThe Site's Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information.\n\nBy visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge and understand that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site and other websites, applications or interactive services through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you. See Your Choices section below for more information on how you can withdraw your consent for certain purposes.\n\nWe use Tracking Technologies to enable us to collect and then use Information as described in Section 4.2 \"Other Information Collected by Us\" under \"How Is Collected Information Used\" below. For example, we use Tracking Technologies to enable Single VII Sign-On, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times or seeing advertisements too frequently, to tailor your experience on the Site by delivering relevant personalized advertising, email marketing and other content and to record if you have opted out of receiving personalized advertising from us.\n\n3.2.2\tThird Parties' Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information.\n\nThis Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or audience measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, \"Third Party Service Providers\") to, for example, facilitate personalized advertisements (\"Customized Advertising\") and/or other content, serve advertisements on the Site and/or measure and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site. Customized Advertising enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you for products and services that you might be interested in based on your visits to the Site and other websites, applications or other interactive services you have visited.\n\nThird Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device subject to your choices about those Tracking Technologies (see \"Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers\" section below and \"More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies\" section below) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Site.\n\nWe may also enlist the assistance of Third Party Service Providers so that the Site may set Tracking Technologies. For example, to the extent necessary to provide basic advertising serving services such as controlling how often you see advertisements or ensuring you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, we may enlist the assistance of such Third Party Service Providers to create, customize or modify Tracking Technologies set by the Site. See also Section 5.2.1 for more information on this Site's use of Nielsen's proprietary measurement software to collect and use video viewing metrics and other information.\n\nExcept to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site, but we may provide to Third Party Service Providers certain Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Site in order for the Site to provide Customized Advertising or in order for the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to the Site, such as measuring or analyzing advertising or content effectiveness or traffic on the Site. For example, in order to analyze traffic on the Site, we may provide to our Third Party Service Providers certain information we collect about your interaction with the Site along with an Identifier so that the Third Party Service Provider may provide analytics services to the Site.\n\n4.

If you use such opt-out tools, your choices only apply to the Third Party Service Providers identified in such links. Please note that, if third party browser cookies are disabled (whether by you or automatically by the browser or Device) or you subsequently delete browser cookies, the opt-out choices you have exercised may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies or opt out again in order for your opt-out choices to function.\nIn addition to the Third Party Service Providers described above, these and other Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative's Opt-Out Tool and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.

Please note that using those controls may affect Tracking Technologies which are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.\nSee the \"More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies\" section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by the Site and for information on your choices regarding Identifiers on mobile platforms.\nThis Site is committed to complying with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Click our Ad Choices link here for more information about this Site and Customized Advertising.\n\nPlease note that if you exercise the Ad Choices opt-out above, that only applies to the use of the data for Customized Advertising and we may still use the data for other purposes described in Section 4.2 \"How is Collected Information Used\" above, such as for video playhead tracking and to optimize your video experience.\n\n5.2.3.\tMore Information on Managing Tracking Technologies. With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, please note the following with respect to the above opt-out options:\n\nYour Choices Regarding the Site's Use of Information for Customized Advertising. You can prevent the Site's use of Information collected through Tracking Technologies for Customized Advertising by exercising the opt-outs offered by Third Party Service Providers we use as described in our Ad Choices link here. Some of your options available in our AdChoices link may opt you out of receiving Customized Advertising across Devices.\nMore Information About Cookie Controls.\nFor the following Internet browsers, you may prevent or exercise choices regarding browser cookies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls described in the following:\nInternet Explorer 11 Chrome\nSafari\nFirefox\nIf your Internet browser is not listed above or you otherwise are having difficulties with the links, you may be able to access controls to:\nDelete existing browser cookies through the \"Internet Options\", \"Settings\", Preferences\", \"Options\" or similar menu selection in your browser's menu or otherwise as directed by your browser's support feature, which means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in the future.\nDisable browser cookies through the same browser controls which means that browser cookies shall not be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted. Additional information on enabling or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser's support feature. (See the \"help\" section of your browser for more information.) Disabling may sometimes be referred to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices. If you delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.\nChoose to have the Device you use to access the Site warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set. (You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.) This may be available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Site. Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser's support feature.\nSeek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser's support features.\nThe above options may cover browser cookies set by the Site, browser cookies not set by the Site (sometimes called third party cookies) and/or both types of browser cookies. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATION OF THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS. ALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE BROWSER COOKIE CONTROLS ARE DIFFERENT FROM DO NOT TRACK OPTIONS THAT MAY ALSO BE OFFERED BY CERTAIN BROWSERS.\nMany tools discussed above are \"Internet browser cookie based.\" This means that such tools rely on cookies to remember your choices. For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to re-establish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms described in our Ad Choices link, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through these mechanisms again.\nThe tools are \"Internet browser and Device-specific\" or \"Device-specific\". Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices. This means, for example, that if you block or disable browser cookies for Internet Explorer 9 on one Device, this choice shall not block or disable browser cookies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device or on a different Device using Internet Explorer 9. Further, you may need to separately exercise your options for other platforms, such as mobile platform (as described below). See our Ad Choices link here for more information about this Site and other options you may have regarding Customized Advertising across Devices.\nAutomatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs. Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function. For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.\nYou shall still receive advertisements. Deleting or disabling Third Party Service Providers', Advertisers' or the Site's Tracking Technologies does not mean that you shall no longer receive online ads. If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you shall continue to see ads on this Site and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Site to set Tracking Technologies for frequency capping purposes as described in the \"Information Collected Through the Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies\" section.\nLimitations Regarding Web Beacons. Web beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled Tracking Technologies to track your activities.\nHow to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies). Control of Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies) Must Be Handled Separately. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER. Deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Site through the above options shall not remove Flash LSOs.  For more information about Flash LSOs and how to remove them from your computer, please visit http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html. If you remove Flash LSOs, you may not have access to certain features of the Site and some of our other services may not function properly.\nOther Effects of Managing Tracking Technologies. In addition to the above, if you delete or disable Tracking Technologies set by the Site, the Site may no longer be able to offer certain features or functionality to you, such as remembering your preferences, remembering your username, enabling Single VII Sign-On, saving your player settings or other purposes described in \"Other Information Collected By Us\" above, and some of our other services may not function properly. In addition to the above, if you disable or delete Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers (or if such Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled on your Device or browser), the Site may no longer be able to offer certain functionality to you, such as enabling SMN login or saving your player settings and certain services or advertisements may not work for such Devices or browsers.\nMobile Platforms. Certain mobile platforms, such as Apple or Google, may offer users choice regarding the Identifiers we, Third Party Service Providers or Advertisers may access and use, which may not be browser cookie based. We encourage you to review and understand the choices that such mobile platforms may provide to you regarding these Identifiers.\nCertain Identifiers. Certain Identifiers we set may not be deleted, blocked or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such Identifiers rely on, or are associated with, browser cookies or other Tracking Technologies.\nDo-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit \"do-not-track\" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.\nWe currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals. Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for Customized Advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in this Section 5.2.3 and in Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.\n6.

Please note that your Information may be shared with Co-Branded Partners for purposes of administering or conducting the co-branded services and features (but not for marketing purposes) without a separate opt in (for example, if the Co-Branded Partner is administering a Promotion you have entered, your Information may be shared with the Co-Branded Partner so that the Co-Branded Partner can verify your eligibility and/or contact you if you are a potential winner).\n\n7.1.4\tDisclosure to Operational Service Providers. We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Site's services, features, functions and operations.

Watching my reality shows on here is painful sometimes. I have actually rewatched shows on my tv after I had already watched here and realized somehow I missed a whole section of the show. There have been times that I will be watching and for no reason the episode will just start over. Plus most of the time (not all but most) if you leave the app then go back in, it jumps back to the beginning of your episode and you have to scroll through to figure out where you left off. The episodes start from new to old but if you are watching episode 3 it automatically goes to episode 2 when you finish instead of going to 4 which makes no sense at all. The commercials are terrible and repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat. I understand we have to watch them in order to get the free app but they could at least be normal commercials that you see on TV. Some of these look like my children produced them. I had to sit through 20 seconds of a child swimming and doing flips in a pool with no words, no promoting, nothing. Umm ok. Then they promote stores and events all in FL lol. I’m in NJ and can’t figure out how to change the settings. We get it, Ace Hardware pays a lot to promote with VH1! I can’t remove closed caption to save my life which drives me crazy.

I can start off watching a show, cast it to my tv then boom the sound is off but you can hear other parts of the show playing or a commercial playing over it. The app will be casting the show and it starts to lag. I’m on the beginning of the show but the sound is on the middle of the show. I click a certain episode then it plays another episode I didn’t select to watch. I have to stop casting, close the app, re open the app, find my episode, cast it to the tv, then for what, for me to have to do the steps all over again?! This is absolutely frustrating. It should not take you 30 mins to an hour to get the app to function just to watch one episode or one show. You’re better off just watching vh1 straight from your cable Provider because this app just isn’t it. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled and I’m have the same issues. Then you would expect the next episodes to continue, nope the current episode that you’re watching will play at least 5 times before the app just stops casting.

I personally don’t always have the time to watch my favorite shows live which is why I downloaded the app. I’ve have the app for well over 6 Months and honestly no matter how many times there’s an update the problems never seem to get fixed. Often times in the middle of watching a show the sound will cut off and video will just play on its own, when I try to rewind I get hit with a bunch of commercials I don’t feel like watching. Speaking of commercials, this app plays too many of them \u0026 they all seem to be the same exact commercials that honestly gets so tiring. With this new update, if I were to accidentally lock my phone or interrupt the show in any way the entire thing starts over from the beginning and as I fast forward I have to sit through the same boring commercials.

And judging from tons of reviews over the last several years complaining- it’s clear that they have no intention of fixing this app. I wish I could give it negative stars as it’s miserable trying to watch my favorite show. 😡","title":"HORRIBLE APP!!!","userName":"Snowlyssa"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1337273394","type":"media/editorial-item","attributes":{"cardDisplayStyle":"SingleApp","displayStyle":"Content","editorialNotes":{"name":"It’s All Stars Season"},"isCanvasAvailable":true,"ignoreEditorialArt":false,"ignoreITunesShortNotes":false,"label":"WHAT TO WATCH","supportsArcade":false,"url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1337273394"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1194749500","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"518317760","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"841118013","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1399446592","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"422366403","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1044871992","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1032488115","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"876520365","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1456618978","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"700797306","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"316797394","type":"media/developer","attributes":{"genreNames":["App Store"],"name":"VH1","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/vh1/id316797394"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6016","type":"media/genre","attributes":{"name":"Entertainment","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/id6016","parentName":"App Store","parentId":"36"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"413522634-appletvos","type":"media/app-platform","attributes":{"bundleId":"com.mtvn.vh1tvtunein","editorialArtwork":{"originalFlowcaseBrick":{"width":3200,"height":600,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features4/v4/a6/2e/99/a62e9993-1f37-a138-b601-a668290bd8b0/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"d0d0d0","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"a6a6a6"},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features118/v4/cd/63/42/cd63422c-5255-8533-4cfa-600cbfe572fe/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"b48d44","textColor1":"050200","textColor2":"161616","textColor3":"281e0e","textColor4":"362e1f"},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features118/v4/08/1b/58/081b58e9-04a6-5be1-8816-7e1776900c8a/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ebc78a","textColor1":"1b0c01","textColor2":"472807","textColor3":"44311c","textColor4":"684821"},"bannerUber":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features125/v4/bd/b7/a7/bdb7a710-5567-a7d0-9b9c-ce21c2d35d76/source/{w}x{h}sr.{f}","bgColor":"9b999f","textColor1":"0c0c0d","textColor2":"111111","textColor3":"212223","textColor4":"262627"},"fullscreenBackground":{"width":4320,"height":2160,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features128/v4/97/96/96/979696aa-8530-8f12-950f-37f254ee7b10/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"805225","textColor1":"f9f2dd","textColor2":"fadfaf","textColor3":"e1d2b8","textColor4":"e1c394"},"contentLogo":{"width":2400,"height":390,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features118/v4/08/5f/70/085f700c-0bc5-02eb-6e38-072faa90f9c1/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"ffffff","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"cbcbcb"},"brandLogo":{"width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features124/v4/e7/d2/a8/e7d2a85d-671a-8182-1416-eaf11a5c1e1d/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor4":"b7b7b7"},"contentLogoTrimmed":{"width":695,"height":364,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features123/v4/c7/10/53/c71053bb-ff5a-dc28-9de8-46402d639a33/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"2b2b2b","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"555555"}},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"Mama Ru is back with season 3"},"hasInAppPurchases":false,"hasMessagesExtension":false,"isAppleWatchSupported":false,"isGameCenterEnabled":false,"isHiddenFromSpringboard":false,"isSiriSupported":false,"releaseDate":"2011-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","requiresGameController":false,"subtitle":"Full Episodes, Live TV \u0026 Video","supportsGameController":false,"supportsPassbook":false,"copyright":"© 2021 VH1 All rights reserved.","description":{"standard":"Enjoy Love \u0026 Hip Hop Atlanta, Black Ink Crew, RuPaul's Drag Race and many more, available on Apple TV.
