The mobile app is solid and one of my go-to apps. Unfortunately, I don’t normally have the opportunity to listen to your audio content. I often click through an intriguing title in your mobile app only to find the content I had hoped to read is audio. <br /><br />I wish I could listen to all of your trenchant analysis, but I can only read it. Please help me know which is which before I click through. Thanks for considering my suggestion.</p>

    Great articles, extremely frustrating app update

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have had and enjoyed the slate app for probably about a year now. It’s a far better mobile reading experience than browser, despite some bugs and the fact that the entire backlog of content is too large for the app. However, the most recent update has left me at the end of my rope. I have slate plus, and the app does not remember that I have logged in. Annoying, but I use a password manager. What pushes this from annoyance to unacceptable is that in order to log back in (after it auto logs me out every time the app closes), I have to uninstall and reinstall because the login page will not display correctly. To be clear, the slate plus login page will only load the first time I open it after a fresh installation. It will not load under any other circumstance. In practice, this means that I must uninstall and reinstall the app every single day to read new articles (I read far more articles than the monthly free limit allows, hence purchasing slate plus). I admittedly have a decently old iPhone (iphone 7) but my iOS is up to date and I have never had this issue with other apps. I have not been able to find a way to contact the app developers about this issue, but hopefully you will see this review and address this extraordinarily annoying problem.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been a fan of Slate’s content for many years and I’ve thought of them as an essential voice in the American media landscape, so when they started Slate Plus, I signed on and downloaded their app. Prior to that I had just used Apple podcasts. Their app is very weak, to the point where it significantly degrades my enjoyment of their content. It does not effectively attach to the native services of the iOS operating system, so when it’s playing audio and you want to switch to playing music, the Slate audio does not stop. Similarly, if you pause it and then unpause it using external audio controls, via Bluetooth, it doesn’t restart. Now, for the last two weeks in a row, my FAVORITE podcast of all, the Political Gabfest keeps pausing itself every two minutes or so and has to be restarted manually, which requires unlocking the phone and navigating down two levels in the menu structure (again, it does not play well with iOS).  So much for listening to it while you cook dinner. The overall performance of the app is very slow and it does not support downloading podcasts in advance so you can listen to them offline. The fact that I’ve had to go back to Apple’s lackluster podcast app would tell you my standards for ease of use are low, but Slate’s app doesn’t meet them.</p>

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and disclose information through the websites, mobile applications, and other online services and products that link to or post this Policy (collectively, the “Services”).  Please read the entire Privacy Policy before using our Services.  By using the Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.\n\n1.     Information We Collect\n\nYou generally are not required to provide information about yourself when you visit the Services.  However, we may ask you for some or all of the following types of information when you register with our Services, access various content or features, register for contests or sweepstakes, submit comments and other content, order products, or directly contact us with questions or feedback:\n\nContact information, such as name, e-mail address, postal address, and telephone number;\n\nUser name, display name, and password;\n\nDemographic information, such as age information and gender;\n\nPayment information, such as credit card number and expiration date;\n\nGeolocation information;\n\nCommunications preferences;\n\nSearch queries;\n\nStories, comments, photos, and other information posted in our interactive online features;\n\nCorrespondence and other information that you send to us; and\n\nAdditional information as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.\nWe also may collect certain information automatically when you visit the Services, including:\n\nYour browser type and operating system;\n\nYour Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is the number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet and that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area;\n\nOther unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers;\n\nSites you visited before and after visiting the Services;\n\nPages you view and links you click on within the Services;\n\nInformation collected through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies;\n\nInformation about your interactions with e-mail messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded; and\n\nStandard Server Log Information\nWe may use cookies, pixel tags, Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash Cookies”), and similar technologies to automatically collect this information.  Cookies are small bits of information that are stored by your computer’s web browser.  Pixel tags are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs,” that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from your computer or device.  Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash Cookies”) are similar to standard cookies except that they can be larger and are downloaded to a computer or mobile device by the Adobe Flash media player.  By using the Services, you consent to our use of cookies and similar technologies.  You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser.  However, if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain online products, services or features on the Services.\n\n2.     Use of Information\n\nWe may use information that we collect through the Services for a variety of purposes, including to:\n\nProvide you with the products, promotions, services, newsletters, and information you request and respond to correspondence that we receive from you;\n\nCustomize and personalize your use of the Services;\n\nProvide Slate Plus users with premium content, products, promotions, and information;\n\nContact you via email and otherwise about products, services, and events that we think might be of interest to you;\n\nContact you with surveys, legal notices, and other information that may be relevant to your use of the Services;\n\nMaintain or administer the Services, perform business analyses, or for other internal purposes to improve the quality of our business, the Services, and other products and services we offer;\n\nPublish stories, comments, and other information posted in our interactive online features;\n\nProcess employment applications and inquiries; and\n\nAs otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.; and\n\nTo show you relevant ads both on our Services and elsewhere, and measure the effectiveness and reach of ads. We may also combine information that we collect through the Services with other information we obtain about you to serve and measure advertising. To learn more about how you can opt out of interest-based advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice Page.  \n3.     Sharing of Information\n\nWe are committed to maintaining your trust, and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share the information we collect.\n\nCorporate Parents, Affiliates, and Subsidiaries.  We may share your information with our corporate parents, subsidiaries, and other affiliated entities for a variety of purposes, including business, operational, and marketing purposes.\n\nService Providers.  We may share your information with service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf, such as to host the Services, manage databases, host a store or other e-commerce platform, perform analyses, or send communications for us.\n\nSelect Business Partners.  We may share your information with select business partners so that they can provide you with special offers, promotional materials, advertisements and other materials that may be of interest to you. However, Slate is not responsible for the privacy practices of these business partners, which may use your information for their own purposes.\n\nOther Parties When Required By Law or as Necessary to Protect the Services.  We may disclose your information to third parties in order to protect the legal rights, safety, and security of Slate, our corporate parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries, and the users of our Services; enforce our Terms of Use; prevent fraud (or for risk management purposes); and comply with or respond to law enforcement or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government or other entity, whether or not legally required.\n\nIn Connection With a Transfer of Assets. If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer your information to one or more third parties as part of that transaction.\n\nOther Parties With Your Consent. We may share information about you with third parties when you consent to such sharing, including when you post information to a user profile or a public area of the Services, such as a chat room, forum, blog, or other community tool.\n\nAggregate Information. We may disclose to third parties information that does not describe or identify individual users, such as aggregate website usage data or demographic reports.\nWe may allow third parties to place and read their own cookies, web beacons, Local Shared Objects, and similar technologies to collect information through the Services.  For example, our third-party service providers may use these technologies to collect information (i) that helps us with traffic measurement, research, and analytics, and (ii) that is used to serve advertisements on our Services and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.  Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash Cookies”) are similar to standard cookies except that they can be larger and are downloaded to a computer or mobile device by the Adobe Flash media player.  Please note that you may need to take additional steps beyond changing your browser settings to refuse or disable Local Shared Objects and similar technologies.  For example, Local Shared Objects can be controlled through the instructions on Adobe’s Setting Manager page.  If you choose to refuse, disable, or delete these technologies, some of the functionality of the Services may no longer be available to you.\n\nSlate does not share information that it collects with third parties for the third party’s direct marketing purposes.\n\n4.     Data Security\n\nWe maintain reasonable security procedures to help protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information you provide to us.  Please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.\n\nYou are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any access to or use of the Services using your password, whether or not authorized by you.  Please notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.\n\n5.     Children’s Privacy\n\nThe Services do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent, except as permitted by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). \n\n6.     Social Networking Services\n\nSlate has worked with certain third-party social media providers to offer you their social networking services through our Services.  For example, you can use third-party social networking services, including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, and others to share information about your experience on our Services with your friends and followers on those social networking services.  These social networking services may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on our Services.  These third-party social networking services also may notify your friends, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services, in accordance with applicable law and their own privacy policies.  If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your contacts on those social networking services.\n\nYou also may be able to link an account from a social networking service (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) to an account through our Services.  This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign in to certain features on our Services.  If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Policy.\n\n7.     Privacy Policy Updates\n\nWe may modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting revisions to the Services or other appropriate notice.  Your continued use of the Services after any modification to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of the new terms and conditions.\n\n8.     Links to Third Party Sites and Services\n\nThe Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under the control of or maintained by Slate.  Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Slate of those other websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to this third-party content.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services.\n\n9.     International Users\n\nPlease note that the Services are directed towards users who reside in the United States. By using the Services, you consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information in and to the United States, or other countries and territories, pursuant to the laws of the United States.  While some of these countries may not offer the same level of privacy protection as your own, Slate commits to uphold the privacy protections as explained in this Policy.\n\n10.  Your California Privacy Rights\n\nIt is our policy not to share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. \n\nSome web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, Slate currently does not take action in response to these signals.  If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.\n\n11.  Communications Preferences\n\nYou may choose to receive promotional emails, newsletters, and similar communications from us.  You may opt out of receiving commercial emails from us by clicking on the opt-out or “unsubscribe” link included in the commercial e-mails you receive.  Please note that opt-out requests may take up to 10 business days to be effective.  Your opt-out request will not apply to messages that you request or that are not commercial in nature.  For example, we may contact you concerning any purchases you have made with us, even if you opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial email messages.\n\n12.

And the benefits are clear: not only all the articles you want to read (with a cleaner reading experience) but also ad-free podcasts and bonus show content.\n\nBecoming a member is also the best way to help us shape that journalism. We get to learn more about what you’d like to see more (and less) of, and you get to know us better, too: through special events and reader-feedback sessions and the like. A publication that relies more fully on its subscribers is a publication that serves them better. And Slate has always wanted to be the sort of place that’s in a kind of perpetual conversation with its audience.\n\nUp till now, Slate has provided almost all of its written work in the iOS app for free. But going forward, we think the way we will truly thrive is by continuing to diversify our revenue—by asking readers like you to support us more directly. In the coming months, some of our most engaged visitors will be prompted to join Slate Plus in order to keep reading articles in the app.\n\nSubscribing will cost $58.99. There’s also a two-week free trial if you want to think about it a little while longer.\n\nThank you again for being a loyal Slate reader and listener. Making Slate for you is what’s exciting about making Slate in the first place.\n\nAnd please consider joining Slate Plus if you haven’t, so that we can continue bringing Slate to you tomorrow.\n","releaseDate":"2021-04-03"},{"versionDisplay":"5.5.2","releaseNotes":"This build fixes an issue where logged in users would get logged out after some period of inactivity.

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and disclose information through the websites, mobile applications, and other online services and products that link to or post this Policy (collectively, the “Services”).  Please read the entire Privacy Policy before using our Services.  By using the Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.\n\n1.     Information We Collect\n\nYou generally are not required to provide information about yourself when you visit the Services.  However, we may ask you for some or all of the following types of information when you register with our Services, access various content or features, register for contests or sweepstakes, submit comments and other content, order products, or directly contact us with questions or feedback:\n\nContact information, such as name, e-mail address, postal address, and telephone number;\n\nUser name, display name, and password;\n\nDemographic information, such as age information and gender;\n\nPayment information, such as credit card number and expiration date;\n\nGeolocation information;\n\nCommunications preferences;\n\nSearch queries;\n\nStories, comments, photos, and other information posted in our interactive online features;\n\nCorrespondence and other information that you send to us; and\n\nAdditional information as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.\nWe also may collect certain information automatically when you visit the Services, including:\n\nYour browser type and operating system;\n\nYour Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is the number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet and that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area;\n\nOther unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers;\n\nSites you visited before and after visiting the Services;\n\nPages you view and links you click on within the Services;\n\nInformation collected through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies;\n\nInformation about your interactions with e-mail messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded; and\n\nStandard Server Log Information\nWe may use cookies, pixel tags, Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash Cookies”), and similar technologies to automatically collect this information.  Cookies are small bits of information that are stored by your computer’s web browser.  Pixel tags are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs,” that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from your computer or device.  Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash Cookies”) are similar to standard cookies except that they can be larger and are downloaded to a computer or mobile device by the Adobe Flash media player.  By using the Services, you consent to our use of cookies and similar technologies.  You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser.  However, if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain online products, services or features on the Services.\n\n2.     Use of Information\n\nWe may use information that we collect through the Services for a variety of purposes, including to:\n\nProvide you with the products, promotions, services, newsletters, and information you request and respond to correspondence that we receive from you;\n\nCustomize and personalize your use of the Services;\n\nProvide Slate Plus users with premium content, products, promotions, and information;\n\nContact you via email and otherwise about products, services, and events that we think might be of interest to you;\n\nContact you with surveys, legal notices, and other information that may be relevant to your use of the Services;\n\nMaintain or administer the Services, perform business analyses, or for other internal purposes to improve the quality of our business, the Services, and other products and services we offer;\n\nPublish stories, comments, and other information posted in our interactive online features;\n\nProcess employment applications and inquiries; and\n\nAs otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.; and\n\nTo show you relevant ads both on our Services and elsewhere, and measure the effectiveness and reach of ads. We may also combine information that we collect through the Services with other information we obtain about you to serve and measure advertising. To learn more about how you can opt out of interest-based advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice Page.  \n3.     Sharing of Information\n\nWe are committed to maintaining your trust, and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share the information we collect.\n\nCorporate Parents, Affiliates, and Subsidiaries.  We may share your information with our corporate parents, subsidiaries, and other affiliated entities for a variety of purposes, including business, operational, and marketing purposes.\n\nService Providers.  We may share your information with service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf, such as to host the Services, manage databases, host a store or other e-commerce platform, perform analyses, or send communications for us.\n\nSelect Business Partners.  We may share your information with select business partners so that they can provide you with special offers, promotional materials, advertisements and other materials that may be of interest to you. However, Slate is not responsible for the privacy practices of these business partners, which may use your information for their own purposes.\n\nOther Parties When Required By Law or as Necessary to Protect the Services.  We may disclose your information to third parties in order to protect the legal rights, safety, and security of Slate, our corporate parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries, and the users of our Services; enforce our Terms of Use; prevent fraud (or for risk management purposes); and comply with or respond to law enforcement or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government or other entity, whether or not legally required.\n\nIn Connection With a Transfer of Assets. If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer your information to one or more third parties as part of that transaction.\n\nOther Parties With Your Consent. We may share information about you with third parties when you consent to such sharing, including when you post information to a user profile or a public area of the Services, such as a chat room, forum, blog, or other community tool.\n\nAggregate Information. We may disclose to third parties information that does not describe or identify individual users, such as aggregate website usage data or demographic reports.\nWe may allow third parties to place and read their own cookies, web beacons, Local Shared Objects, and similar technologies to collect information through the Services.  For example, our third-party service providers may use these technologies to collect information (i) that helps us with traffic measurement, research, and analytics, and (ii) that is used to serve advertisements on our Services and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.  Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash Cookies”) are similar to standard cookies except that they can be larger and are downloaded to a computer or mobile device by the Adobe Flash media player.  Please note that you may need to take additional steps beyond changing your browser settings to refuse or disable Local Shared Objects and similar technologies.  For example, Local Shared Objects can be controlled through the instructions on Adobe’s Setting Manager page.  If you choose to refuse, disable, or delete these technologies, some of the functionality of the Services may no longer be available to you.\n\nSlate does not share information that it collects with third parties for the third party’s direct marketing purposes.\n\n4.     Data Security\n\nWe maintain reasonable security procedures to help protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information you provide to us.  Please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.\n\nYou are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any access to or use of the Services using your password, whether or not authorized by you.  Please notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.\n\n5.     Children’s Privacy\n\nThe Services do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent, except as permitted by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). \n\n6.     Social Networking Services\n\nSlate has worked with certain third-party social media providers to offer you their social networking services through our Services.  For example, you can use third-party social networking services, including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, and others to share information about your experience on our Services with your friends and followers on those social networking services.  These social networking services may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on our Services.  These third-party social networking services also may notify your friends, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services, in accordance with applicable law and their own privacy policies.  If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your contacts on those social networking services.\n\nYou also may be able to link an account from a social networking service (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) to an account through our Services.  This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign in to certain features on our Services.  If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Policy.\n\n7.     Privacy Policy Updates\n\nWe may modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting revisions to the Services or other appropriate notice.  Your continued use of the Services after any modification to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of the new terms and conditions.\n\n8.     Links to Third Party Sites and Services\n\nThe Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under the control of or maintained by Slate.  Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Slate of those other websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to this third-party content.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services.\n\n9.     International Users\n\nPlease note that the Services are directed towards users who reside in the United States. By using the Services, you consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information in and to the United States, or other countries and territories, pursuant to the laws of the United States.  While some of these countries may not offer the same level of privacy protection as your own, Slate commits to uphold the privacy protections as explained in this Policy.\n\n10.  Your California Privacy Rights\n\nIt is our policy not to share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. \n\nSome web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, Slate currently does not take action in response to these signals.  If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.\n\n11.  Communications Preferences\n\nYou may choose to receive promotional emails, newsletters, and similar communications from us.  You may opt out of receiving commercial emails from us by clicking on the opt-out or “unsubscribe” link included in the commercial e-mails you receive.  Please note that opt-out requests may take up to 10 business days to be effective.  Your opt-out request will not apply to messages that you request or that are not commercial in nature.  For example, we may contact you concerning any purchases you have made with us, even if you opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial email messages.\n\n12.

It’s a far better mobile reading experience than browser, despite some bugs and the fact that the entire backlog of content is too large for the app. However, the most recent update has left me at the end of my rope. I have slate plus, and the app does not remember that I have logged in. Annoying, but I use a password manager. What pushes this from annoyance to unacceptable is that in order to log back in (after it auto logs me out every time the app closes), I have to uninstall and reinstall because the login page will not display correctly. To be clear, the slate plus login page will only load the first time I open it after a fresh installation. It will not load under any other circumstance. In practice, this means that I must uninstall and reinstall the app every single day to read new articles (I read far more articles than the monthly free limit allows, hence purchasing slate plus). I admittedly have a decently old iPhone (iphone 7) but my iOS is up to date and I have never had this issue with other apps. I have not been able to find a way to contact the app developers about this issue, but hopefully you will see this review and address this extraordinarily annoying problem.","title":"Great articles, extremely frustrating app update","userName":"practicalkats"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4968986167","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-10-18T20:21:01Z","rating":1,"review":"I’ve been a fan of Slate’s content for many years and I’ve thought of them as an essential voice in the American media landscape, so when they started Slate Plus, I signed on and downloaded their app. Prior to that I had just used Apple podcasts. Their app is very weak, to the point where it significantly degrades my enjoyment of their content. It does not effectively attach to the native services of the iOS operating system, so when it’s playing audio and you want to switch to playing music, the Slate audio does not stop. Similarly, if you pause it and then unpause it using external audio controls, via Bluetooth, it doesn’t restart. Now, for the last two weeks in a row, my FAVORITE podcast of all, the Political Gabfest keeps pausing itself every two minutes or so and has to be restarted manually, which requires unlocking the phone and navigating down two levels in the menu structure (again, it does not play well with iOS).  So much for listening to it while you cook dinner. The overall performance of the app is very slow and it does not support downloading podcasts in advance so you can listen to them offline. The fact that I’ve had to go back to Apple’s lackluster podcast app would tell you my standards for ease of use are low, but Slate’s app doesn’t meet them.","title":"Great content, lousy app","userName":"$/$:\u0026@/-$"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7457521631","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-06-12T20:41:53Z","rating":1,"review":"I have been reading Slate since it began and finally gave in and purchased Slate+ this year because they started metering and tightening the amount of free reads. Maybe that makes me cheap, but I’m a school teacher and try to save pennies where I can. IMO the writing is not what is was 10 years ago, but it is still pretty strong on the whole and still feels indispensable to me. \nBUT, I don’t know how they can sleep at night charging us almost $60 and giving us an app that is so legendarily dreadful. And the thing is: the app has always been bad. They fix it for a while and then it breaks, again and again. When I wasn’t paying for it, I swallowed my complaints. But c’mon! I know they had a major loss of ad revenue since Covid, which lead to the tighter meter, but can you please allocate some resources to the tech side here? I have to sign in again, every time, for each new story, and the podcast play bar only appears halfway on my iPhone screen. And the podcast does not remember where you paused. And the podcast time codes are often completely unrelated to the actual concepts of time and space. \nUgh.

When I first began listening to podcasts they’d shut off. Thinking it was my phone, I tried my iPad, with no better success. I was so frustrated, I began listening to podcasts with the commercials. Of course that led to even greater frustration as I was paying to NOT have the commercials. So I just stopped listening. \nI might have stopped paying for Slate altogether, but that seems wrong as I like the articles and my knowledge of politics, as well as all things current, comes primarily from written word. But these podcasts are good. So I tried again, thinking surely, they’ve got this thing fixed. Yet now it seems worse, if that’s possible. I can maybe get 5 minutes before it shuts off. At home it’s annoying, but I can go back to the app (which, by the way, completely closes out each time, requiring me to find the particular episode I want and begin again) to restart. When I’m driving, however, I’m stuck. \nWhile I like the work Slate does, I am so very tempted to stop my subscription. I think after 3 plus years, I’ve received little value but shown support.

Sadly I am going to disable the app because you won’t let me read it unless I pay. It started with Slate+ being the gateway to much of Dear Prudence and ended today when you gave me notice I had read all the free articles I could without subscribing and you shut me off. My question is: if I need to pay to read, what do you do with all the advertising dollars you must generate because there are ads everywhere? Just like many other current sources, I’m asked to pay and then wade through many, many ads to find the pieces of the article. I’m not paying them either. And I’m not paying to play games, nor do I pay to watch cable TV for $150 a month and still put up with ads everywhere. It just bothers me about you more than the others because I enjoy Slate—your writers are fantastic, the content is always interesting and compelling, and the satire suits me perfectly.

For me, The Gist was absolutely the best daily podcast out there, offering a truly balanced look at the political and social concerns of our country at this time. \nI have never had any reply to my queries about why the show has been censored, nor have I found any articles about it on their site. I am extremely disappointed and without further information I simply cannot place any trust in the articles or even other podcasts that form a part of their conglomerate. I fully understand that my one small voice means nothing to them, but it is still leaves me feeling bad, which is simply not something I need to be reminded of each time I open the app. I will probably hold out just a bit longer to see if the podcast returns, or to get definitive information about why he was pulled, but then for my own well-being I need to delete Slate from my news feed and move on.

I’ve checked multiple times to make sure the app is updated, so I guess I’m just dealing with the best that it can be?\n\nOne more weird thing: even when I am logged in, sometimes I open the app, and the same article from summer 2020 about age 35 being a fertility cliff is at the top of “recent” for like 2 seconds.

One time everything displayed in italics for a couple of days for no apparent reason.

It launched seven years ago, and it has become a very important part of how we sustain our business—and how we think about our relationship to readers and listeners. (If you are reading this as a member, thank you! Nothing is changing for you or your membership.)\n\nBecoming a Slate Plus member is the absolute best way to back the journalism we do. And the benefits are clear: not only all the articles you want to read (with a cleaner reading experience) but also ad-free podcasts and bonus show content.\n\nBecoming a member is also the best way to help us shape that journalism. We get to learn more about what you’d like to see more (and less) of, and you get to know us better, too: through special events and reader-feedback sessions and the like. A publication that relies more fully on its subscribers is a publication that serves them better. And Slate has always wanted to be the sort of place that’s in a kind of perpetual conversation with its audience.\n\nUp till now, Slate has provided almost all of its written work in the iOS app for free. But going forward, we think the way we will truly thrive is by continuing to diversify our revenue—by asking readers like you to support us more directly. In the coming months, some of our most engaged visitors will be prompted to join Slate Plus in order to keep reading articles in the app.\n\nSubscribing will cost $58.99. There’s also a two-week free trial if you want to think about it a little while longer.\n\nThank you again for being a loyal Slate reader and listener. Making Slate for you is what’s exciting about making Slate in the first place.\n\nAnd please consider joining Slate Plus if you haven’t, so that we can continue bringing Slate to you tomorrow.\n","releaseDate":"2021-04-03"},{"versionDisplay":"5.5.2","releaseNotes":"This build fixes an issue where logged in users would get logged out after some period of inactivity.
