Pairing white-knuckle action with an array of career and online modes, it sets a new standard for arcade racers on the App Store.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Ever since this game came out I’ve loved it. But the one problem I have is not the game itself it’s it’s three former predecessors. Ever since IOS 11 came out I have not been able to use asphalt 5, 6, or 7. They were great games and I really think it’s possible to bring all the games back to the AppStore. I know they don’t have the best graphics or the best cars. But they all had such a thriving community. These were games I grew up playing. This was what really got people into the asphalt franchise before asphalt 8. Although they don’t come close to the technology that asphalt 8 and 9 have. I think it would great to be able to go back and play them. I feel the reason why game loft took the games off of the AppStore is because it would affect their brand as an image. However this is a very specious argument because playground games and EA booth let their players play their older gam games. I also feel why this could be possible is because about two years ago game loft put GT racing two back on the AppStore for people to play again. Although they took the servers down the game was still fun to play. I really feel like this could be possible for game loft to do and I don’t think it would effect asphalt 8 and 9’s popularity. I hope that someday we will be able to play these games again.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>When I saw ads for this game, I really wanted to try it out, so I downloaded it and was instantly impressed. The beautiful graphics and UI just blew me away! The entertainment this game brings will make play it for hours at a time. However, all great games aren’t perfect. It is very hard to progress in this game, as cars either cost too much, or the blueprints for them are too rare. Finding 40 blueprints for a single car really just isn’t worth it, so can this maybe be nerfed GameLoft? Also, bugs... though they can be hard to find, they really can annoy someone after a while. For example, when I am racing online, the momentary invincibility after a wreck will sometimes stay on other racers, making it impossible to knock them down. Another example, in multiplayer, when the cars start, some of the other user’s cars wont move, grinding you to a sudden halt, but then they teleport forwards, putting you in nearly dead last. One more bug that ticks me off, where you respawn after wrecking. One time on the map “London Eye” I was knocked down in midair during a jump over a river. I kept respawning right in front of the ramp and couldn’t build up enough speed to make the jump, making an endless loop of me crashing. Though these bugs tick me off, I still love the game, and will keep playing it for a long time, despite the minor and sometimes major annoyances that pop up. Keep up the good work GameLoft!</p>

This Policy outlines the types of personally identifiable information and other data that we will collect from you through the various websites, games and applications we provide (\"Websites/Apps\"), and how we will use and when we might disclose such information and data to third parties. Your installation and/or use of these Websites/Apps and/or submission of information to us constitute your consent to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 1, 2008 and was last modified on May 28, 2015. \n\nThere are two types of information we may collect through your use of the Websites/Apps: \n\n1. “Personal Information,” which is the type of information that specifically identifies you personally and/or can be used alone to contact you online or offline, such as your full name, physical address, email address, telephone number, photograph, precise geolocation information (i.e., your specific location), credit card information and, in some cases, usernames; and \n2. “Non-personal Information,” which is information that does not identify you and cannot be used to contact you personally, including information about you such as your date of birth, age, ZIP code, non-precise geolocation information (e.g., your city), and gender, as well as information about your computer and mobile device, such as your unique device ID, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other persistent identifiers, and their hardware/software/firmware. Non-personal Information also includes “Usage Data,” which is anonymous data tied to your computer and/or device, such as the actions you take within and outside of the Websites/Apps, the browser you use, the identity of other apps included on your device, the date and time of your use of the Websites/Apps, your game progress, play time, score and achievements, and the URLs you visited and/or apps you used before and after using our Websites/Apps. \nPersonal Information and Non-personal Information That We Collect and How We Collect It \n•\tIf you choose to open an account with us, register for a contest, sign up for our newsletter, request support, or in any other way take steps that require the submission of Personal Information or Non-personal Information, we may collect information such as your name, email address, physical address, date of birth, gender and/or phone number. \n•\tIf you choose to connect to one of our Websites/Apps through a third-party social network such as Facebook or Game Center, we may collect Personal Information and Non-personal Information from your profile on such third-party social networks, such as your name, username, photograph, gender and date of birth. \n•\tIf you choose to make a purchase through our Websites/Apps, we will collect your credit card information and other billing information. \n•\tIf you choose to make use of any public forum, comment section, or chat function, we may collect any Personal Information you may disclose through such means. \n•\tIf you choose to send a message to another user or defined group of users through our message, chat, post or other in-game function, we may collect any Personal Information you may disclose through such means, as well as the necessary Personal Information of the user(s) you are contacting, in order to facilitate the communication (Note: we will never collect any information sent outside of the functionality of our Websites/Apps, including through emails or text messages). \n•\tIf you choose to enable push notifications, we may use your Personal Information, or Non-personal Information such as a device ID, in order to send push notifications to your device. \n•\tWe may collect precise geolocation information provided that, prior to doing so initially, you will either be informed of this practice or be prompted to allow or block this feature.  In the event you proceed with acquiring the Website/App or choose to allow this feature, you will be able to block it at any time thereafter by taking the appropriate steps in the Settings tab.\n•\tSome of our Websites/Apps may read your device to determine what other apps have been installed and Non-personal Information, such as your city and gender, may be inferred based on the identity of those apps.\n•\tIf you choose to submit your Personal Information to us for any other reason in any other form, we will collect such Personal Information and use it for the purposes for which you submitted it. \n•\tWe will not collect any Personal Information from you simply by virtue of your visiting our Website; we only collect it if you choose to submit it to us. We do, however, collect Non-personal Information such as device IDs, IP addresses and other persistent identifiers, as well as Usage Data, whenever you use our Website/Apps. Such Non-personal Information is not combined with Personal Information unless you choose to submit Personal Information to us.\n Cookies\nIn connection with the foregoing collection of Personal Information and Non-personal Information, we may also use cookies (tiny text files that are stored on your computer's hard drive or mobile device when you visit certain web pages that identify your computer or mobile device and may store information about you). Should you choose to submit Personal Information to us, we may link cookie information to such Personal Information. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, some of our services will not function properly if you do so and you may lose access to the services you purchased. To learn more about cookies and how to reject them, visit www.aboutcookies.org.\n\nUse of the Personal Information That We Collect \nWe will use your Personal Information to: \n•\tprovide you with any goods, services, or functionality you have requested; \n•\trespond to any inquiries you have made through our customer service features; \n•\tcontact you to promote our Websites/Apps, contests and any specials we may offer; \n•\tsend you newsletters, advertising or marketing materials. We will provide you with the opportunity to opt out of receiving such materials in the future. You may also opt out of receiving such materials at any time in accordance with the instructions provided in this Privacy Policy; \n•\tcontact you in relation to contest registration and prize acceptance.\n\nUse of the Non-personal Information That We Collect \nNon-personal Information may be used by us for administrative, analytical, research, optimization, security and other purposes. Specifically, we may use your Non-personal Information to:\n•\ttrack your use of our Websites/Apps to help us learn more about your gaming activities and understand your preferences and tendencies so that we can personalize your experience, provide you with in-game offers and notifications that are tailored to you, and otherwise enhance your gaming experience; \n•\tpersonalize your content and offers; \n•\tcompile statistics;\n•\trespond to customer service inquiries;\n•\tprotect against cheating, crime or fraud, or for other security reasons;\n•\tprovide you advertising that better suits your interests, and profile and is age/gender-appropriate and targeted to your general location;\n•\tdetermine the jurisdiction in which you are located so we can determine what set of laws apply to you;\n•\tsend you push notifications (if you choose to allow that function).\n\nDisclosure of the Personal Information and Non-personal Information That We Collect \n•\tGameloft Inc. is a global company with offices and entities around the world. We may transfer your Personal Information and Non-personal Information to our other entities, but such information shall continue to be governed by this Privacy Policy. \n•\tWe will not sell, rent or transfer your Personal Information to third parties without your prior consent. \n•\tWe may share non-precise geolocation information or precise geolocation information (if you choose to allow us to collect it) with advertisers to allow them to display more relevant and geographically appropriate advertisements to you.\n•\tWe may share your Non-personal Information (including Usage Data) with third parties to assist with the purposes described in the section above entitled “Use of the Non-personal Information That We Collect”, including sharing Usage Data and Non-personal Information such as device IDs, advertising IDs or other persistent identifiers and non-precise geolocation information with advertisers.  \n•\tOur Websites/Apps offer social sharing features such as “Share” or “Like” on Facebook. If you decide to use such features, it may allow the sharing and collection of Personal Information and Non-personal Information both to and from such third-party social networks. You should visit the policies of such third parties for more information about their information collection practices.  \n•\tWe will not store your credit card information. In order to process credit card payments, we will use the service of a secure third-party credit card processor. \n•\tWe use the services of third parties who will have limited access to your Personal Information to be used for specific purposes. These purposes may include credit card processing, prize delivery, marketing assistance, customer service, and data analysis. The third parties we contract with for these purposes will be authorized to use your Personal Information only for the purposes for which the party was engaged. In addition, Non-personal Information in aggregated, anonymous form may be shared with third parties who assist us with our internal operations such as administration, analytics, research, and optimization. \n•\tWe may disclose your Personal Information or other information collected if required by law or court order, if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct, to investigate and/or take action against illegal activity, suspected abuse or unauthorized use of the Websites/Apps, or to protect the property or safety of others. \n•\tIn connection with any sale of our company or any line of business (including the assets relating thereto), customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets, and such customer information (including your Personal Information) will be transferred or sold to the acquirer in the event of any such sale or disposition of any or all of our business. \n\nAdvertising \nBy using our Website/Apps, you may be offered advertising content. We or the ad networks we use may utilize ad-serving technologies that use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels and other technologies that are placed within the ads and allow us or our networks to collect Non-personal Information. Non-personal Information such as age and gender may be used to ensure that appropriate advertising is offered to you. Usage Data and Non-personal Information such as advertising identifiers may be used to determine how many clicks an ad received, to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns, to determine the proper amount of repeat views of a given ad, and/or to deliver ads that best relate to your interests. Depending on your device and its operating system, you may be able to choose to prevent your device's ad identifier being used for interest-based advertising or reset your device's ad identifier by changing the settings of your device.\n\nYour Rights \nWe ask that you keep the Personal Information that you provide to us current and that you correct any information you have provided us by contacting us at PrivacyPolicyGameloft@gameloft.com. You represent and warrant that all Personal Information you provide us is true and correct and relates to you and not to any other person.  \n\nIf you wish to opt out of further communications from us, or if you wish to review, delete and/or revise the Personal Information we have stored about you, please contact us with your specific request at PrivacyPolicyGameloft@gameloft.com; provided, however, that we reserve the right to retain an archive of such Personal Information for a commercially reasonable time to ensure that its deletion does not affect the integrity of our data; and we further reserve the right to retain an anonymous version of such information. \n\nIf you wish to opt out of push notifications, select the Settings tab for the applicable Website/App, and follow the necessary prompts to opt out of further push notifications. \n\nYou can decline to permit cookies in your browser, but in that case we cannot promise you that all Website/App features will function properly as a result. \n\nIf you use the Websites/Apps, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and for restricting access to your computer or device, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. \n\nPartnerships and External Sources \nOur Websites/Apps may link to external sites beyond our control. This privacy policy covers only the way we treat the Personal Information and Usage Data we collect on our Websites/Apps. By accessing any external sites, you are agreeing to the privacy policies of those sites. Please understand that the external sites may have different policies with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information. We have no control over and are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. Therefore, you are encouraged to review the privacy policies of all third-party Websites/Apps. Without limiting anything in the following section, we are not liable in any way for the actions, inactions or policies of any external Websites/Apps. \n\nChildren \nMany of our Websites/Apps are intended for general audiences, and we do not knowingly collect or use any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. When users are identified as under 13, we will block such users from providing Personal Information or make sure to get prior parental consent before collecting Personal Information. To the extent we feel that any of our Websites/Apps are directed to children under the age of 13, we will not collect Personal Information from users of those Websites/Apps. \nIf you are a parent of a child under 13 years of age and you believe your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us at PrivacyPolicyGameloft@gameloft.com and we will delete the information from our system. \n\nWe may collect Non-personal Information, such as a device ID or other persistent identifier linked to the device or computer, which may be used by a child to play our Websites/Apps. The data collected will be anonymous and not tied to any Personal Information. In addition, this data will be used solely for internal purposes such as personalization of content, security, and contextual (not behavioral) advertising. \n\nCertain of our Websites/Apps may permit in-game purchases, even if the applicable game was free to download. Such purchases do not always require the re-entry of credit card information because they may be made through an existing third-party account (such as an iTunes account). If you are a parent who is concerned about this feature, you may disable the ability to make in-game purchases by selecting the Settings tab for the applicable Website/App, and following the necessary prompts to prohibit such purchases. \n\nIf you are between the age of 13 and 18, please obtain your parents' permission prior to registering with our Platform or providing us with any Personal Information. \n\nChanges \nWe reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. In the event we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, such policy will be re-posted in the \"Privacy\" section of our Websites/Apps with the date such modifications were made indicated on the top of the page. Therefore, please review this Privacy Policy from time to time so that you are aware when any changes are made to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Websites/Apps after such change constitutes your acceptance of any such change(s), and if you do not accept any changes, you may choose not to use the Websites/Apps or opt out by sending us an appropriate notice. \n\nWebsites/Apps Security \nIt is entirely your choice whether or not you provide Personal Information to us. We and/or our third-party partners have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to attempt to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the Personal Information collected through the Websites/Apps. We take, or obligate applicable third parties to take, reasonable precautions to protect our customers' Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, please remember that no transmission of data over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us or from us, and you do so at your own risk. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us by email and you do so at your own risk. \n\nWhen we use third parties to assist us in processing your Personal Information or credit card information we take reasonable steps to require that they comply with this Privacy Policy and otherwise protect your Personal Information (including any credit card information). \n\nIf there is a breach of security involving your credit card information from our Websites/Apps, we will inform you immediately and take commercially reasonable steps to rectify such breach. \n\nIf you believe your Personal Information is being improperly used by us or any third party, please immediately notify us via email at PrivacyPolicyGameloft@gameloft.com. \n\nIn the event you choose to establish an account with us, you should not share your login information with anyone. \n\nLegal Disclaimer \nOur Websites/Apps operate AS-IS, and we do not represent or warrant that our Websites/Apps will be available at all times, or that your use of the Websites/Apps will be uninterrupted or error-free. We are not responsible for your ability to access the Websites/Apps or for matters beyond our control. This Privacy Policy is governed by California law, excluding its provisions on choice of law. \n\nIf you have any general questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at PrivacyPolicyGameloft@gameloft.com.","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Conquer street and sky in Gameloft’s fastest racing game yet, a mix of high-octane driving and incredible jumps that harkens back to the age of San Francisco Rush and classic Burnout.

This Policy outlines the types of personally identifiable information and other data that we will collect from you through the various websites, games and applications we provide (\"Websites/Apps\"), and how we will use and when we might disclose such information and data to third parties. Your installation and/or use of these Websites/Apps and/or submission of information to us constitute your consent to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 1, 2008 and was last modified on May 28, 2015. \n\nThere are two types of information we may collect through your use of the Websites/Apps: \n\n1. “Personal Information,” which is the type of information that specifically identifies you personally and/or can be used alone to contact you online or offline, such as your full name, physical address, email address, telephone number, photograph, precise geolocation information (i.e., your specific location), credit card information and, in some cases, usernames; and \n2. “Non-personal Information,” which is information that does not identify you and cannot be used to contact you personally, including information about you such as your date of birth, age, ZIP code, non-precise geolocation information (e.g., your city), and gender, as well as information about your computer and mobile device, such as your unique device ID, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other persistent identifiers, and their hardware/software/firmware. Non-personal Information also includes “Usage Data,” which is anonymous data tied to your computer and/or device, such as the actions you take within and outside of the Websites/Apps, the browser you use, the identity of other apps included on your device, the date and time of your use of the Websites/Apps, your game progress, play time, score and achievements, and the URLs you visited and/or apps you used before and after using our Websites/Apps. \nPersonal Information and Non-personal Information That We Collect and How We Collect It \n•\tIf you choose to open an account with us, register for a contest, sign up for our newsletter, request support, or in any other way take steps that require the submission of Personal Information or Non-personal Information, we may collect information such as your name, email address, physical address, date of birth, gender and/or phone number. \n•\tIf you choose to connect to one of our Websites/Apps through a third-party social network such as Facebook or Game Center, we may collect Personal Information and Non-personal Information from your profile on such third-party social networks, such as your name, username, photograph, gender and date of birth. \n•\tIf you choose to make a purchase through our Websites/Apps, we will collect your credit card information and other billing information. \n•\tIf you choose to make use of any public forum, comment section, or chat function, we may collect any Personal Information you may disclose through such means. \n•\tIf you choose to send a message to another user or defined group of users through our message, chat, post or other in-game function, we may collect any Personal Information you may disclose through such means, as well as the necessary Personal Information of the user(s) you are contacting, in order to facilitate the communication (Note: we will never collect any information sent outside of the functionality of our Websites/Apps, including through emails or text messages). \n•\tIf you choose to enable push notifications, we may use your Personal Information, or Non-personal Information such as a device ID, in order to send push notifications to your device. \n•\tWe may collect precise geolocation information provided that, prior to doing so initially, you will either be informed of this practice or be prompted to allow or block this feature.

We do, however, collect Non-personal Information such as device IDs, IP addresses and other persistent identifiers, as well as Usage Data, whenever you use our Website/Apps. Such Non-personal Information is not combined with Personal Information unless you choose to submit Personal Information to us.\n Cookies\nIn connection with the foregoing collection of Personal Information and Non-personal Information, we may also use cookies (tiny text files that are stored on your computer's hard drive or mobile device when you visit certain web pages that identify your computer or mobile device and may store information about you).

We or the ad networks we use may utilize ad-serving technologies that use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels and other technologies that are placed within the ads and allow us or our networks to collect Non-personal Information. Non-personal Information such as age and gender may be used to ensure that appropriate advertising is offered to you.

When users are identified as under 13, we will block such users from providing Personal Information or make sure to get prior parental consent before collecting Personal Information.

In addition, this data will be used solely for internal purposes such as personalization of content, security, and contextual (not behavioral) advertising. \n\nCertain of our Websites/Apps may permit in-game purchases, even if the applicable game was free to download. Such purchases do not always require the re-entry of credit card information because they may be made through an existing third-party account (such as an iTunes account). If you are a parent who is concerned about this feature, you may disable the ability to make in-game purchases by selecting the Settings tab for the applicable Website/App, and following the necessary prompts to prohibit such purchases. \n\nIf you are between the age of 13 and 18, please obtain your parents' permission prior to registering with our Platform or providing us with any Personal Information. \n\nChanges \nWe reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time.

But the one problem I have is not the game itself it’s it’s three former predecessors. Ever since IOS 11 came out I have not been able to use asphalt 5, 6, or 7. They were great games and I really think it’s possible to bring all the games back to the AppStore. I know they don’t have the best graphics or the best cars. But they all had such a thriving community. These were games I grew up playing. This was what really got people into the asphalt franchise before asphalt 8. Although they don’t come close to the technology that asphalt 8 and 9 have. I think it would great to be able to go back and play them. I feel the reason why game loft took the games off of the AppStore is because it would affect their brand as an image. However this is a very specious argument because playground games and EA booth let their players play their older gam games. I also feel why this could be possible is because about two years ago game loft put GT racing two back on the AppStore for people to play again. Although they took the servers down the game was still fun to play. I really feel like this could be possible for game loft to do and I don’t think it would effect asphalt 8 and 9’s popularity. I hope that someday we will be able to play these games again.","title":"The others","userName":"Mrs.Kiltry"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2873466540","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-07-09T22:29:40Z","rating":4,"review":"When I saw ads for this game, I really wanted to try it out, so I downloaded it and was instantly impressed. The beautiful graphics and UI just blew me away! The entertainment this game brings will make play it for hours at a time. However, all great games aren’t perfect. It is very hard to progress in this game, as cars either cost too much, or the blueprints for them are too rare. Finding 40 blueprints for a single car really just isn’t worth it, so can this maybe be nerfed GameLoft? Also, bugs... though they can be hard to find, they really can annoy someone after a while. For example, when I am racing online, the momentary invincibility after a wreck will sometimes stay on other racers, making it impossible to knock them down. Another example, in multiplayer, when the cars start, some of the other user’s cars wont move, grinding you to a sudden halt, but then they teleport forwards, putting you in nearly dead last. One more bug that ticks me off, where you respawn after wrecking. One time on the map “London Eye” I was knocked down in midair during a jump over a river. I kept respawning right in front of the ramp and couldn’t build up enough speed to make the jump, making an endless loop of me crashing. Though these bugs tick me off, I still love the game, and will keep playing it for a long time, despite the minor and sometimes major annoyances that pop up. Keep up the good work GameLoft!","title":"All great games still have issues...","userName":"skillcraft20"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7041166639","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-26T15:00:10Z","rating":5,"review":"Bro I can’t tell you how well this game is made and all the mechanics that this game has to put it all together. They always update the latest models of sports cars which I love because I keep track of the newest lambos and Bugatti’s and asphalt 8 is pretty good at keeping up to date which is awesome. After playing for a while you can learn to get pretty good at the game and you can actually get  decent cars. This is cool because most games it takes SOOOO LOOONG to get an upgrade on games and hold you back by forcing you to use your in game money on other things. But the fact that this game allows you to actually work and save for specific cars that you want makes the game absolutely worth playing. The only downside is that I had completly maxed out an S level bugatti veyron so it was insanely fast and top of the line but they changed it and brought it down to an A level which sucked cuz I couldn’t race in the S races anymore since I didn’t have an S level car. It was a put down but not to much I was able to just get a new S level car that wasn’t as good but still I would’ve liked to be able to make more in game money on more professional car races","title":"Awesome game","userName":"Goatlord777"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7164897186","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-03-31T04:25:07Z","rating":4,"review":"I would like to start by saying I enjoy playing this game a lot. This is one of my favorite games by far. I’ve recently re-downloaded the game, and I have seen many car classifications change, which is fine by me. My question is, why did some cars go up in price? I remember when some were around 300k-400k coins, and now they’re over a million! I just don’t quite understand that. \nAlso, why are all the S-tier vehicles only purchasable by tokens and fusion coins? I would like to have the option to purchase with coins. \nLastly, why did the “Ultimate” feature have to put on some cars? I know that this feature has been in the game for a while now. In my opinion, that’s a very dumb feature, because I remember working very hard to buy the Koenigsegg Agera R, my favorite car, and almost max it out completely. Then, after an update, I see that “Ultimate” forms of cars were added. This included the Agera R, and I was not pleased. The car I worked hard to improve didn’t have that great of stats anymore! If I’m the only one who feels this way about the “Ultimate” cars, then that’s ok. I would just prefer there to be no “Ultimate” cars. If this change could be made down the road, I would be very happy. \nAll in all though, thank you for making a great game! It has brought much joy to my gaming life.","title":"Price Changes","userName":"Bass_MC"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6132836471","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-28T17:53:05Z","rating":4,"review":"I absolutely love this game. It’s super fun and addictive and I’ve been playing for a long time. The thing is, I only have a couple cars and I can’t upgrade things because it’s all way too expensive. It takes too many credits and it’s like the game is forcing your hand into making purchases. I would like to have a chance to get at least 1 car in each class without spending that much. I can’t participate in races because my rank is too low, and races don’t give enough money so I can’t upgrade. I like a good challenge. But this is too challenging, because over all of my years, I still only have A and C class cars. Even R\u0026D events are hard because you have to keep upgrading and there’s too many races to do because I never have enough time. I like the festival format better, with the challenges. I am almost at level 8 and about to finally have an s class car. The problem with that is besides multiplayer, I can’t use it in career, because I am only in season 4. And I can’t do any of the C class races in season 4 because my rank is too low, and I only have 1 C class car. So if possible, please reduce prices, scrap R\u0026D events, make races give more money, and maybe at the beginning of the game, give the player 1 car in every class, so at least they can play in events.","title":"Great, but too expensive.","userName":"sexyantelope69"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6707537382","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-12-01T23:51:47Z","rating":3,"review":"I play this game on my iPad and I use tilt controls in this game. But, every couple of days, my tilt controls switch. You will see what I mean now. Every couple of days my tilt controls mess up and it caused the cars to be almost impossible to drive properly. The first time this has happened to me, I was driving my Porsche 959 in mastery. At the beginning of the race, when I tilted my iPad right, my car turned left instead of right. I was like”What the truck is happening?”, and later in the race I have also realized that tilting my iPad right turns the car left and turning my iPad left turns the car right. A few seconds later, I changed controls because of how difficult it was to control the car with these new tilt controls. Tilt controls in this game are not new. After the race, I have decided to learn these new controls. I decided to start in Tokyo Reverse where they no turns for a while. I used my motorcycle and in the race, I was not able to control the bike at all with these difficult tilt controls, so I have decided to quit the race and by the way, this was a solo race. I have found that using a control different than tilt controls actually turns the tilt controls back to normal if you use a different control. Please please please please fix this, Gameloft.","title":"Annoying mobile controls that make the cars near imposter to drive","userName":"Elidoesnotthinkyoutube"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3320923105","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-10-19T23:18:56Z","rating":1,"review":"Gotta be real, loved this game at first, until I realize the ratio of winning credits/receiving tokens to the amount I’m required to spend to really get anywhere and/or buy the cars I need. I won’t ever spend money on iAPs when the app itself is free, or at least make it more reasonable so I’ll just keep replaying the same races 100s of times 😜. Even the extra nitrous, extra credits for one day, performance upgrades right before your race starts is way too expensive. You guys really need to chill out and stop being money hoggers.\n\nAlso, with this newest update, how does AI manage to catch up to you without using nitrous, pass you, and maintain the lead when you yourself have a maxed out car and on nitrous? That to me makes no sense at all. It’s as if you guys improved the ‘physics’ and added a little magic to AI, to make us work for the impossible and then force us buy iAPs when that shouldn’t even be possible IRL. I’ve also had a multiple times where AI purposely crash into the wall, then the car bounces off and flies toward the opposite way, and you’ve got no chance to avoid it and you end up crashing too. Not only do they crash, when you attempt to knock them out during stronger NOS, they somehow resist, then all of a sudden turn and you both end up crashing on the sidewall with no chance of you recovering. That was never the case before the update. Come on guys, be realistic.","title":"Forces you to use real cash to get somewhere in the game","userName":"hcphoto93"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7427096576","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-06-04T22:28:05Z","rating":3,"review":"Great game play, awesome graphics. I’m ok with the paying and have played for years and amassed a great garage with not paying, so I understand that to get more ultra-Premium rides, one should pay, that’s all good. I have noticed that there has not been any Season updates in forever, finished all I could basically a few years ago and it’s still the same as it was then (a few new things piped up last year or so, but not much). Also events changed from having rather cool events that changed every few days (with that one with the boost and shooting, that was really awesome!!), but now it’s only three events and they are the basically the same every time featuring a different car...gets boring. Also when adding the new purple coins and taking away the cards or something changed there that just made it more confusing when upgrading cars. Overall the game play is nothing new and course are nothing new, and unless I spend a good amount of cash, no new cars...again I’d be more inclined to spend money on premium cars if there was some fun exciting and new game play to play with them on, but I’m tired of the same old stuff.

This loss of earned vehicle credit is unacceptable and the infusion of dozens of other upgrades and cards (engines, new vehicles, upgrades through cards, parts) not only reduces odds of completing those remaining S-class cards and prior in-game upgrades but essentially thefts hard-earned and collected car availability. Really unfortunate and would insist that these cards be returned to use (please allow for car build from previously collected Class C, B, and A cards and continue to infuse the game with this cards.

I’ve been able to see how asphalt has drastically changed over these years and when I say “drastically” I’m not exaggerating when I say this, it’s because I no longer recognize this app. I am fine with little changes since this app is getting older and there needs to be some sort of a improvement, however I longer recognize this app. Over the years I have noticed that this game has become a pay-to-win game, you’re literally forced to spend money in the game in order to have some sort of success. It’s become very hard earning tokens/credits and trying to buy way over priced cars, which just makes it un-fun. The memories I have of the game in its earliest years will never leave me, and that’s because it was that unique and lovable, now I look at the game and I don’t feel those feelings any longer. And no, the world does not revolve around me and my feelings of the game, but I am sure others out there feel the same way I do. I hope the game will maybe one day be somewhat like it was back then.
