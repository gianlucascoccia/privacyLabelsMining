        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I started out wanting to use the app for the workouts. What I found was so much more than I was prepared for. I’ve used the meal planning far more than the exercises and am able to log in my exercises outside of what I have utilized on the app. Being that I am far sighted, the only complaint I have is that the app is no longer viewable on the laptop and I can only see the recipes and workouts on my iPhone. This makes it harder for me to see and read. The workouts are seriously awesome, although the yoga is not my favorite and I have been doing yoga for 20 years now so I have had a lot of instruction. I am combining this platform with other workouts to provide myself an experience that works for me, which would be much more difficult to accomplish without this app. I would use it just for the food. I’ve watched the recipe offerings and options increase dramatically over the last two years. I just wish that I could at least print them out or look at them on a larger screen so I could see them better. I guess I’m just older now and have a harder time than younger people.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>For the annual cost of this app I would want a little more. The actual program seems great, for me I know enough about how my body responds that I could replace a gym membership with this. And it also offers meal plans. I think everything is a bit more like guides than an actual ‘plan’. Just like with anything, you have to factor in what you know works for your body and your lifestyle but the program is highly adaptable so it should work for almost anyone. That being said, for the money I would want a little more. You can’t put in health conditions, like I have bad knees but there are no modified exercise options and they have me doing a ton of lunges. Ouch. There’s also no charts for your weight, measurements, etc... that’s just a personal preference, but seeing the line move down closer to my goal weight has always been the biggest motivator for me. So yeah, it’s great, a little basic but the workouts will make you sweat and the food options look very tasty and you can customize how often you repeat a meal. For someone like me who eats basically the same thing all week to cut down on costs, that’s a big plus. When my free trial ends I am seriously considering cancelling my gym membership and forking our the money for the app. Just a few tweaks would make it perfect in my opinion.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love how customizable the meals and workouts are – especially the meals. I have tons of food allergies, plus the need to eat vegetarian two days a week. 8fit is the ONLY app I’ve seen that allows me to customize to this level, and I love it! I would rate it 5 stars if it weren’t for the shopping list. I tried it only once, because it dropped 3 of the meals (they didn’t show up at all on the shopping list). Plus, when I got home, some of the ingredients I had bought didn’t seem to appear in any of the recipes I had chosen. Third – but this is simply a preference – I wish the shopping list would group foods based on where they will show up in a typical grocery store:  all produce grouped together, all dairy grouped together, all canned goods grouped together, all boxed and soft-pack goods grouped together, etc. I tried to select all the vegetables and fruits at once, and found out at the end of my shopping that the citrus was in a different category! So, I had to traipse back over there at the end, with my tired kids in tow, to get the lemons, limes, and oranges.  Overall, though, I am loving 8fit! I have decided to continue with the paid plan of $60/year — Thank you for the free, 1-month trial, 8fit. That gave me a chance to try it out, revise, try again, revise, and find what worked just for me. Loving it!</p>

Personal data is any information that allows an individual to be identified directly or indirectly.

If other service provides are involved in the performance of the agreement, e.g. payment services, optimization services or hosts, your data will be forwarded to them to the extent required.\nWhen you access our Services, some information is exchanged between your device and our server, or the server of the services we use. This may include personal information. One of the ways in which the information gathered in this way will used is to further improve our Service.  \nUnder the GDPR, you have various rights that you can assert with us.

Name and Contact Information for the Person Responsible for Data Processing and of the Company’s Data Privacy Officer\nThis privacy policy applies to the use of data by Urbanite Inc., 9450 SW GEMINI Dr. 20004, Beaverton, OR 97008, USA, as the responsible party under the GDPR for the following services: www.8fit.com and the 8fit-App. The company may be reached at the aforementioned address or by email at datenschutz@8fit.com. The designated representative within the EU, pursuant to Art. 3, paragraph 2, in conjunction with Art. 27, paragraph 1(3), of the GDPR is 8fit GmbH, Stralauer Allee 10, Berlin.\n\n3. Purposes of Data Collection, Legal Basis and Legitimate Interests Pursued by Us or a Third Party, and Categories of Recipients\n3.1. Accessing our Service\nIf you access our Services, especially by visiting our website or app, the app or the browser used on your device automatically sends information to our server and temporarily stores it in a log file. The following information is collected without your intervention and stored until it is automatically or manually deleted in the log file:\n\nYour device’s IP address\nDate and time of access\nThe name and URL of the retrieved file, the website/app from which access was made (referrer URL)\nYour browser’s unique identifier\nThe name of your Internet provider\nThe processing of the aforementioned data is based on Article 6(1) f) of the GDPR. Our legitimate interest arises from the uses listed below. At this point, we note that we are unable and do not attempt to draw any conclusions about your identity from the data collected. Your device’s IP address and the other information listed above are used by us for the following purposes:\n\nTo ensure that a trouble-free connection can be established\nTo ensure the convenient use of our Services\nTo evaluate system security and stability\nOther administrative purposes\nThe data is stored in compliance with legally established data retention periods and then deleted automatically. We also use cookies, tracking tools, targeting methods and interfaces to other services such as social media platforms, payment processors or app store providers. The exact procedures, and how your data will be used for this purpose, are explained in more detail in Section 4 below.\n\n3.2. Concluding, Performing or Terminating an Agreement\nData Collected when concluding an agreement\nWe primarily define our Services as those of a personal fitness trainer: Based on your own self-defined training goals, we prepare your personal training and nutritional plan with workouts, suggested recipes and a broad variety of other information about health, fitness and nutrition. To do this, we collect the information required to conclude, perform or terminate an agreement.  This includes:\n\nE-mail address\nFirst and last name\nBilling and payment information\nInformation you enter yourself and that is generated during the use of our Services, such as gender, age, height, weight, training goals, training history, sporting activities, mealtimes, etc.\nThe legal basis for this is Art. 6(1) a) and b) and Art. 9(2) a) of the GDPR. Unless we use your contact information for customer support or customer service (see details under Section 3.3), the information required to conclude the agreement is stored until it is no longer needed for this purpose and/or until the rights under any guarantee or warranty expire. Subsequently, we retain the required personal information for the periods established by law. During this retention period (usually six to 10 years after conclusion of the agreement), the information is used only in the case of an audit by the tax authority.\n\n3.3. Data Processing for Customer Support or Customer Service\n\n3.3.1. Informational purposes\nIf you have signed up for our Services, we manage you as an existing customer. In this case, we process your contact information in order to send you information about new, enhanced or improved features, products and services, etc.\n\n3.3.2. Personalized ads\nTo ensure that you receive only information that corresponds to your interests, we classify and add information to your customer profile. For this purpose, both statistical information as well as information about you (such as basic or historical data from your customer profile) are used. The goal is to optimize our Services by adapting them to your actual or perceived interests and/or needs, and to send you the appropriate recommendations and not bother you with useless ads.\n\nThe legal basis for each of the aforementioned data uses is Art. 6(1) b) and f) of the GDPR and Art. 9(2) a) of the GDPR.  The use of existing customer data for the company’s own advertising purpose is recognized as a legitimate interest under Recital 47 of the GDPR.\n\n3.3.3. Customer Support\nZendesk\nOn the basis of Art. 6(1) b) of the GDPR, we use the ticket system of Zendesk Inc., 1019 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA (“Zendesk”) for service, support and other user queries. If you send us a support request over one of our channels (e.g. our contact form, live chat, e-mail, etc.), the following data will be processed over Zendesk’s servers, depending on the content and the selected contact channel:\n\nThe information you enter\nName\nEmail address\nBrowser information\nIP address\nZendesk is certified in compliance with the Privacy Shield Framework and therefore meets European standards for lawful data processing of orders. For more information on Zendesk data processing, see http://www.zendesk.com/company/privacy. You may also send questions directly to the Zendesk data privacy officer at: privacy@zendesk.com\n\n3.3.4. Newsletters\nOne of our Services is to offer prospective customers the opportunity to sign up for our newsletter. We use the double opt-in process to confirm that the email address entered actually corresponds to the prospective customer. After the email address is entered, we send you a confirmation link. Your email address will only be included on our mailing list after you click on this confirmation link. We store the information collected during this process only for purposes of documentation and proof. This includes:\n\n \n\nThe email address you provide\nYour IP address\nThe date and time of registration\nForm of address\nThe date, content and time of the confirmation email\nThe IP address of the device used for the confirmation\nThe date and time of your confirmation\nThe legal basis for this is Art. 6(1) a) GDPR. We store this information until the contract relationship ends as proof of the legality of sending the newsletter. After the contract relationship ends, we retain the required personal information for the period specified by law. During this period (usually 10 years from the conclusion of the agreement), the data will only be processed again in the event of a tax audit. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future. Simply click on the unsubscribe button in the respective e-mail or send a short note by e-mail. Please use the options to contact the company’s data privacy officer for this purpose.\n\n3.3.5. Right to Object\nYou may object to the use of your data for the aforementioned purposes at any time free of charge for each communication channel and with effect for the future. An email or a letter sent using the contact information shown under Section 2 is sufficient for this purpose.\n\nOnce you submit your objection, we will block the relevant contact address for future advertising data processing. We will process your objection as soon as possible and implement the appropriate blocking measures immediately after it is confirmed. Please note that in some exceptional cases the relevant information or product recommendations may still be received even after receipt of your objection. This is simply due to technical reasons and does not mean your objection has not been processed. Thank you very much for your understanding.\n\n4. Data Processing for the Provision of our Services\nIn this section, we inform you about the data processing necessary for the provision of our Services:\n\n4.1. Online Presence and Website Optimization\nWe will not sell or lease your information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We only disclose certain information to third parties from time to time to be able to offer the best possible product to our customers, improve the quality of our Services and protect the interests of our customers. However, this disclosure will always be subject to strict limitations, which are described in more detail below.\n\n4.1.1. Cookies – General Information\nWe use cookies on our website in compliance with Art. 6(1) f) of the GDPR.

Cookies do not harm your device, and do not contain viruses, Trojans or other malware. Cookies contain information downloaded by the specific device. This does not mean, however, that we receive direct knowledge of your identity.  One purpose of cookies is to make it more convenient for you to use our Services. For example, we use session cookies to track your use of the individual pages of our website or when you have logged on to your customer account. When you use our Services again at a later time, the cookie automatically recognizes your previous visit to the website, as well as your input and settings, so that you do not have to enter them again. To make the site more user friendly, we also use temporary cookies, which are stored on your device for a predetermined period of time. These cookies are automatically deleted when you log off.\n\nIf you already have a customer account and are logged on, the information stored in the cookies are associated with that account.\n\nAnother reason we use cookies is to gather statistics on the use of our Services and evaluate them in order to optimize your experience and to display information tailored to you. These cookies allow us to automatically recognize that you have visited our site before. The cookies are automatically deleted after a predefined period. Most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, you can disable cookies on your browser or choose to be notified when a new cookie is created. However, disabling cookies completely may mean that not all features of our Services will be available to you. The storage period of cookies depends on their purpose and may vary.\n\n4.1.2. Braze\nTo design and continuously improve our customer engagement efforts in compliance with Art. 6(1) a) of the GDPR, we use the external service provider Braze, 318 W 39th St, 10018 New York City, USA, (hereinafter “Braze”).

We may automatically send the following information to Sentry in the event of a software failure:\n\nDevice information (operating system, browser version, browser type)\nThe IP address of the device\nEmail\nName\nDate and time of error\nThe legal basis of the aforementioned data processing is Art. 6(1) f) of the GDPR. There is no explicit analysis for advertising purposes in this process. The information is collected anonymously, is not used for personal reasons, and is subsequently deleted. This analysis helps us to continuously improve our website and fix hidden code errors. Such processing is in our legitimate interest because the data is used solely for identifying and analysing errors. For more information on Sentry’s data processing and how it works, see Sentry’s privacy policy: https://sentry.io/privacy/\n\nIn the event that personal data is processed here, you can object to it at any time by simply informing us that you no longer wish to have such processing in the future.

This service helps us to optimize our campaigns and adapt advertising media to specific behaviours and interests, and track their conversion. The tool is integrated into our Services as a Javascript library. The data processing initiated for this purpose is generally anonymous.

It also allows us to track the actions of Facebook users after they have viewed or clicked on one of our Facebook ads.

The following information is collected during its use:\n\nTime stamp\nURL\nCampaign-related information (particularly impression, form field and activated button specifications)\nInformation collected in this way is anonymous to us and therefore does not provide us with any information about the identity of the respective user. Such processing for behavioural and interest-based advertising purposes is recognized as in our legitimate interest under Recital 47 of the GDPR. The data is stored in accordance with the legally established retention periods and then automatically deleted.\n\nYou should be aware that when you log on after placing the pixel on your Facebook account, or you visit our website while logged on, Facebook may store and process this information.

Recipients outside the EU\n\nAs indicated above under 3.4 and 3.5, data may also be sent to recipients located outside the European Union or the European Economic Area. This applies in particular to the aforementioned processing of analysis and/or targeting technologies, which can result in data transmission to the servers of the service providers. Other recipients may be affiliated service providers that we need in order to provide our services, e.g. hosts, CRM tools, analytical service providers. These servers may be outside the EU, especially in the US. We make absolutely sure that these service providers guarantee data protection standards equivalent to those of the GDPR and that they comply with the applicable directives. Therefore, we only work with those service providers who are certified by the EU-US Privacy Shield. In case number C(2016) 4176), the European Commission established the suitability of this data protection level for certification in compliance with Art. 45 GDPR. The use of these certified service providers thus meets European standards for lawful data processing. In addition, we have obtained suitable contractual guarantees from all service providers based in other EU countries, which ensure compliance with these EU standards and the enforcement of the rights of affected persons, for example based on the standard contractual clauses of the European Commission.\n\n5.

Your Rights\n6.1. Overview\nIn addition to the right at any time to withdraw any consent you have given us, you are also entitled to the following if the respective legal conditions are met:\n\nThe right to be informed about your personal data that is stored with us, pursuant to Art. 15 of the GDPR\nIn the event of transmissions covered by Art. 46, 47 or 49(1) 2) of the GDPR, the right to information, or references to suitable or appropriate guarantees that a copy of them can be obtained, or where they are available\nThe right to correct inaccurate or incomplete data, pursuant to Art. 16 of the GDPR\nThe right to the deletion of your personal information that is stored with us, pursuant to Art. 17 GDPR\nThe right to limit the processing of your data, pursuant to Art. 18 of the GDPR\nThe right to data portability, pursuant to Art. 20 of the GDPR.\n6.2. Right to Object\nUnder the provisions of Art. 21(1) GDPR, the data subject has the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to the processing of personal data.\n\nThe foregoing general right to object applies to all processing purposes described in this Privacy Policy that are based on Article 6(1) f) GDPR. Unlike the special right to object to data processing for commercial purposes (see above under Section 3.3), we are only obliged to implement such a general objection under the GDPR if you state reasons of overriding importance (e.g. a potential risk to life or health). Furthermore, you may contact the supervisory authority responsible for us, which is the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (Berliner Beauftragten für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit), Friedrichstraße 219, 10969 Berlin.\n\n7. Data Security\nWe apply the highest standards to data security for our infrastructure and the processing of your data. For example, we use protection mechanisms for computers such as firewalls and data encryption. Our buildings and data are subject to physical access controls. Access to the personal information of our customers is only possible for those employees who need them to carry out their activities.\n\nAll personal data sent by you, including your payment information, is also transmitted using the generally accepted and secure SSL (Secure Socket Layer) standard. SSL is a secure and proven standard, e.g. it is also used for online banking. You will recognize a secure SSL connection with the placement of an “s” at the end of http (i.e. https: // …) in the address bar of your browser, or with the lock icon at the bottom of the browser.\n\nWe also apply suitable technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data stored with us against manipulation, partial or complete loss, and against unauthorized access by third parties. Our security measures are continuously monitored using the latest technology, and regularly adapted to the relevant risk, and improved if necessary.\n\nIn the event that personal data is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose personal data has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.\n\n8. Children’s Privacy\nProtecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 16, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 16 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at datenschutz@8fit.com.\n\n9. Notification Procedures\nIt is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our website page, as determined by us in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n10. Changes to Our Privacy Policy\nIf we change our Privacy Policy and procedures, we will post those changes on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on our website.\n\n11. HIPAA\nWe are not a “covered entity” under the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). The HIPAA privacy rules and regulations apply to health plans, health care clearinghouses, any health care provider who transmits health information in electronic form in connection with transactions for which the Secretary of HHS has adopted standards under HIPAA (collectively, “covered entities”), and their service providers (“business associates”). This means that the personal data that you provide to us is not protected by the HIPAA privacy rules and regulations.\n\nThis Privacy Policy was last modified on 24th May, 2018.","editorialNotes":{"short":"Create your tailor-made fitness and nutrition plan.","tagline":"Combine nutrition with fitness"},"is32bitOnly":false,"isStandaloneWithCompanionForWatchOS":false,"seller":"Urbanite Inc.","isSiriSupported":false,"languageList":["English"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"description":{"standard":"Live a healthier life with 8fit!\n\nDiscover our selection of yoga tutorials and easy to make, delicious recipes on your Apple TV. \nWatch life changing stories of our 8fit users’ as they complete their 12 week fitness and nutrition program.\n\nDiscover the full 8fit experience on your phone! 8fit is your roadmap to a healthier, leaner, fitter you – a personal trainer and nutritionist in your pocket.\nGet customized workout and meal plans to get fit and healthy for life.\n\n*Rated 5 Stars by Thousands of Users *\n\nHow to get started with 8fit:\n1.

Overview\nThe following privacy policy informs you about the nature and extent of the processing of personal data by Urbanite Inc., 9450 SW Gemini Dr., 20004 Beaverton, OR 97008, USA (hereinafter “8fit”, “we”, “us” or “our”). Personal data is any information that allows an individual to be identified directly or indirectly. The use of our app, products, services, technologies or features, and all related pages, applications and services (collectively referred to as the “Services”), is governed by this Privacy Policy.\n\nWhen you register for the first time, or log on in the case of existing customers, you declare by means of a simple notification that you accept this privacy policy and expressly consent to the handling, use and disclosure of your personal data in the manner described herein.\n\nThe data gathered by 8fit can be divided primarily into two categories:\n\nAll data required for the processing, preparation and performance of an agreement with 8fit. If other service provides are involved in the performance of the agreement, e.g. payment services, optimization services or hosts, your data will be forwarded to them to the extent required.\nWhen you access our Services, some information is exchanged between your device and our server, or the server of the services we use. This may include personal information. One of the ways in which the information gathered in this way will used is to further improve our Service.  \nUnder the GDPR, you have various rights that you can assert with us. These include the right to selectively object to the use of data, particularly for advertising purposes. The option to object is highlighted in print. Further information on your rights can be found in the additional section below and in the individual descriptions of the respective data uses.\n\nOur Services are only available to users who are 18 years of age or older. If you are not at least 18 years old, you may only use our Services if your parents have given their consent herein, and you have provided sufficient proof of this consent.\n\nIf you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you may contact our data privacy officer by email at: datenschutz@8fit.com.\n\n2. Name and Contact Information for the Person Responsible for Data Processing and of the Company’s Data Privacy Officer\nThis privacy policy applies to the use of data by Urbanite Inc., 9450 SW GEMINI Dr. 20004, Beaverton, OR 97008, USA, as the responsible party under the GDPR for the following services: www.8fit.com and the 8fit-App. The company may be reached at the aforementioned address or by email at datenschutz@8fit.com. The designated representative within the EU, pursuant to Art. 3, paragraph 2, in conjunction with Art. 27, paragraph 1(3), of the GDPR is 8fit GmbH, Stralauer Allee 10, Berlin.\n\n3. Purposes of Data Collection, Legal Basis and Legitimate Interests Pursued by Us or a Third Party, and Categories of Recipients\n3.1. Accessing our Service\nIf you access our Services, especially by visiting our website or app, the app or the browser used on your device automatically sends information to our server and temporarily stores it in a log file. The following information is collected without your intervention and stored until it is automatically or manually deleted in the log file:\n\nYour device’s IP address\nDate and time of access\nThe name and URL of the retrieved file, the website/app from which access was made (referrer URL)\nYour browser’s unique identifier\nThe name of your Internet provider\nThe processing of the aforementioned data is based on Article 6(1) f) of the GDPR. Our legitimate interest arises from the uses listed below. At this point, we note that we are unable and do not attempt to draw any conclusions about your identity from the data collected. Your device’s IP address and the other information listed above are used by us for the following purposes:\n\nTo ensure that a trouble-free connection can be established\nTo ensure the convenient use of our Services\nTo evaluate system security and stability\nOther administrative purposes\nThe data is stored in compliance with legally established data retention periods and then deleted automatically. We also use cookies, tracking tools, targeting methods and interfaces to other services such as social media platforms, payment processors or app store providers. The exact procedures, and how your data will be used for this purpose, are explained in more detail in Section 4 below.\n\n3.2. Concluding, Performing or Terminating an Agreement\nData Collected when concluding an agreement\nWe primarily define our Services as those of a personal fitness trainer: Based on your own self-defined training goals, we prepare your personal training and nutritional plan with workouts, suggested recipes and a broad variety of other information about health, fitness and nutrition. To do this, we collect the information required to conclude, perform or terminate an agreement.  This includes:\n\nE-mail address\nFirst and last name\nBilling and payment information\nInformation you enter yourself and that is generated during the use of our Services, such as gender, age, height, weight, training goals, training history, sporting activities, mealtimes, etc.\nThe legal basis for this is Art. 6(1) a) and b) and Art. 9(2) a) of the GDPR. Unless we use your contact information for customer support or customer service (see details under Section 3.3), the information required to conclude the agreement is stored until it is no longer needed for this purpose and/or until the rights under any guarantee or warranty expire. Subsequently, we retain the required personal information for the periods established by law. During this retention period (usually six to 10 years after conclusion of the agreement), the information is used only in the case of an audit by the tax authority.\n\n3.3.

Overview\nIn addition to the right at any time to withdraw any consent you have given us, you are also entitled to the following if the respective legal conditions are met:\n\nThe right to be informed about your personal data that is stored with us, pursuant to Art. 15 of the GDPR\nIn the event of transmissions covered by Art. 46, 47 or 49(1) 2) of the GDPR, the right to information, or references to suitable or appropriate guarantees that a copy of them can be obtained, or where they are available\nThe right to correct inaccurate or incomplete data, pursuant to Art. 16 of the GDPR\nThe right to the deletion of your personal information that is stored with us, pursuant to Art. 17 GDPR\nThe right to limit the processing of your data, pursuant to Art. 18 of the GDPR\nThe right to data portability, pursuant to Art. 20 of the GDPR.\n6.2. Right to Object\nUnder the provisions of Art. 21(1) GDPR, the data subject has the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to the processing of personal data.\n\nThe foregoing general right to object applies to all processing purposes described in this Privacy Policy that are based on Article 6(1) f) GDPR. Unlike the special right to object to data processing for commercial purposes (see above under Section 3.3), we are only obliged to implement such a general objection under the GDPR if you state reasons of overriding importance (e.g. a potential risk to life or health). Furthermore, you may contact the supervisory authority responsible for us, which is the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (Berliner Beauftragten für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit), Friedrichstraße 219, 10969 Berlin.\n\n7.

Our security measures are continuously monitored using the latest technology, and regularly adapted to the relevant risk, and improved if necessary.\n\nIn the event that personal data is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose personal data has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.\n\n8. Children’s Privacy\nProtecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16 or knowingly allow such persons to register.

Notification Procedures\nIt is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our website page, as determined by us in our sole discretion.

What I found was so much more than I was prepared for. I’ve used the meal planning far more than the exercises and am able to log in my exercises outside of what I have utilized on the app. Being that I am far sighted, the only complaint I have is that the app is no longer viewable on the laptop and I can only see the recipes and workouts on my iPhone. This makes it harder for me to see and read. The workouts are seriously awesome, although the yoga is not my favorite and I have been doing yoga for 20 years now so I have had a lot of instruction. I am combining this platform with other workouts to provide myself an experience that works for me, which would be much more difficult to accomplish without this app. I would use it just for the food. I’ve watched the recipe offerings and options increase dramatically over the last two years. I just wish that I could at least print them out or look at them on a larger screen so I could see them better.

The actual program seems great, for me I know enough about how my body responds that I could replace a gym membership with this. And it also offers meal plans. I think everything is a bit more like guides than an actual ‘plan’. Just like with anything, you have to factor in what you know works for your body and your lifestyle but the program is highly adaptable so it should work for almost anyone. That being said, for the money I would want a little more. You can’t put in health conditions, like I have bad knees but there are no modified exercise options and they have me doing a ton of lunges. Ouch. There’s also no charts for your weight, measurements, etc... that’s just a personal preference, but seeing the line move down closer to my goal weight has always been the biggest motivator for me. So yeah, it’s great, a little basic but the workouts will make you sweat and the food options look very tasty and you can customize how often you repeat a meal. For someone like me who eats basically the same thing all week to cut down on costs, that’s a big plus. When my free trial ends I am seriously considering cancelling my gym membership and forking our the money for the app. Just a few tweaks would make it perfect in my opinion.","title":"A great little app but pricey","userName":"Ms. DuBois"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3006389697","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-08-02T14:18:09Z","rating":4,"review":"I love how customizable the meals and workouts are – especially the meals. I have tons of food allergies, plus the need to eat vegetarian two days a week. 8fit is the ONLY app I’ve seen that allows me to customize to this level, and I love it! I would rate it 5 stars if it weren’t for the shopping list. I tried it only once, because it dropped 3 of the meals (they didn’t show up at all on the shopping list). Plus, when I got home, some of the ingredients I had bought didn’t seem to appear in any of the recipes I had chosen. Third – but this is simply a preference – I wish the shopping list would group foods based on where they will show up in a typical grocery store:  all produce grouped together, all dairy grouped together, all canned goods grouped together, all boxed and soft-pack goods grouped together, etc. I tried to select all the vegetables and fruits at once, and found out at the end of my shopping that the citrus was in a different category! So, I had to traipse back over there at the end, with my tired kids in tow, to get the lemons, limes, and oranges.  Overall, though, I am loving 8fit! I have decided to continue with the paid plan of $60/year — Thank you for the free, 1-month trial, 8fit.

I am 59 and just can’t do some of the exercises in Master III. When you finish a level, the app only gives you a choice to except the next level. This is a flaw, as it should say something like bump up or repeat current level. Instead is says continue to next level and you get know choice as far as I can tell. Once at the higher level, you can then chose that the routine is too difficult and  bump down to a previous level, but, because you have already completed that level the app does not recognize or ask if you want to repeat the whole level again. It still shows all routines as being completed with the little green check in the upper left of the routine. Then after completing just one routine, the app thinks your all done with that level because the whole level is checked off and forces you to the next level again. Then vicious cycle continues. If the app isn’t fixed soon I will stop paying for it and switch to another app. I am hoping this review gets someone’s attention and they prioritize this fix and soon.","title":"Clunky if you want to stay at a particular level","userName":"MDow2020"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2282861867","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-03-08T05:12:49Z","rating":5,"review":"I’ve recently been on a search for a fitness app that is easy to use, fits with my busy schedule, and is quick, convenient and effective at helping me achieve my goals. 8fit is all of these and more.

I follow the apps workout but then I run on a treadmill or elliptical after. When I try to enter my time and calories burned, they don’t match what the machine has. The app doesn’t know what level I used on the elliptical or how fast or the elevation I had the treadmill set, but it still gives a preset calories number of calories burned based on time. It’s frustrating because I use this app with another calorie counter app and it’s not accurate. Even though I like this app, I’m going to start searching for one that fits my needs.
