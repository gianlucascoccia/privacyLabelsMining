        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is Actions version 2 and it’s our most exciting update yet - with your most requested new feature and lots of big changes under the hood that our team has been working on for months. Special shout out to Simon, Alex and Andrew who have been leading the charge on building, testing and finessing the goodies we now all get to enjoy!<br /><br />If you use Actions on multiple devices, ensure they are all updated to use the new features.<br /><br />CHECKLISTS<br /><br />This version introduces something thousands of you asked us to make – checklists.  Each action card can now have its own checklist, opening up entirely new ways of organising what you need to get done.  For example, you could create an Action called “Chicken Risotto” then add the ingredients as a checklist.<br /><br />To get started with checklists, just tap on an action and you’ll see a new add item button right up top.<br /><br />When you add checklists to an action, there is a handy progress indicator on the action itself so you know the status with just a glance. <br /><br />Checklists are synced instantly to all your devices including the web so you can stay productive from your desktop (actions.moleskinestudio.com).<br /><br />ENHANCEMENTS<br /><br />We’ve refined lots of things all across the app, including an easier way to manage the color of your lists and beautiful new pastel options.<br /><br />Also check out the oh-so-satisfying new animation when completing an action.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS<br /><br />Our entire backend infrastructure has been rebuilt to be faster and more reliable than ever.  It also paves the way for some sophisticated new features we are currently building for future versions.<br /><br /><br />If you&#39;ve got a feature idea, tap Feature Request from the Help screen or visit https://bonobo.canny.io/actions and let us know! This is where our members and team decide on what we will work on for you next.<br /><br />We are working around the clock to update and improve Actions.

Often your good intentions come crashing to the ground as you see the intimidating collection of jobs you’ve been putting off. Actions by Moleskine is designed to make life easier. No, it won&#39;t magically tackle your outstanding tasks, but it will take away some of the fear factor, making your to-do list look and feel more accessible and achievable.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love this app and Moleskine’s other scheduling app, Timepage. They’re intuitive and beautiful and don’t make me annoyed—normal scheduling apps drive me nuts when I’m setting the reminder alarms, dates, etc. I hate fuss. I even stopped using my phone for scheduling and just went back to pen and paper to avoid it! But these apps take the fuss away and feel great to use. They’re easier than getting out a planner, believe it or not. I was thinking about creating a no-fuss scheduling app since there were none a few years ago. The biggest tech companies are still completely missing the mark about quick, intuitive and stylish schedulers (how does that happen? These guys need more ergonomics-focused people on their teams for sure.) Glad to see I don’t have to bother anymore!<br /><br />The only issue I’m having is that Actions is not “connecting”, whatever that means. Basically, I subscribed to the app for a year with my Apple ID but the intro pages that explain how to the use the app still come up every single time I open the app new... at least once a day or any time after I’ve manually quit the app. It says something about not having a network connection... I don’t understand because I’m connected to the internet and I’ve gone through all the settings trying to resolve the problem. May have to do with the fact that I live outside the U.S.? This glitch (is it a glitch?) is annoying, but the app is so valuable I don’t care that much.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I cannot put into words how much I enjoy this app! I have NEVER purchased an app until now; there are just too many that are free and I am a cheapo. This app, however, cannot be compared to any other. As a manager with hundreds of little things to keep up with, on top of having ADHD, the actions app is truly life changing! I’m also easily frustrated with complex technology; even though scheduling/customizing recurring reminders/tasks took a minute to figure out, the actions app is extremely easy to use! I used to just make lists in my notes app on my iPhone; now, I put EVERYTHING in my actions app!! You can make lists for anything, add notes to each task if needed, and you don’t have to schedule them until you’re ready. Speaking of scheduling, you can set a custom day for each task/reminder. You can also set reminders on the day of and head of time! <br />I set recurring reminders that repeat monthly/weekly/yearly for bills, appointments, birthdays, etc. My lists are: Grocery, Order, To Do ASAP, To Do Later, Goals, Miscellaneous, &amp; Work. It has been so beneficial to my personal life that I decided to purchase it for all of the company phones at work! For the price of one meal at a cheap restaurant, you can have mind blowing organization and productivity. Why would you not, at the very least, test out the free trial??? <br />(Ps. Sorry for the novel. Lol)</p>

They’re intuitive and beautiful and don’t make me annoyed—normal scheduling apps drive me nuts when I’m setting the reminder alarms, dates, etc. I hate fuss. I even stopped using my phone for scheduling and just went back to pen and paper to avoid it! But these apps take the fuss away and feel great to use. They’re easier than getting out a planner, believe it or not. I was thinking about creating a no-fuss scheduling app since there were none a few years ago. The biggest tech companies are still completely missing the mark about quick, intuitive and stylish schedulers (how does that happen? These guys need more ergonomics-focused people on their teams for sure.) Glad to see I don’t have to bother anymore!\n\nThe only issue I’m having is that Actions is not “connecting”, whatever that means. Basically, I subscribed to the app for a year with my Apple ID but the intro pages that explain how to the use the app still come up every single time I open the app new... at least once a day or any time after I’ve manually quit the app. It says something about not having a network connection... I don’t understand because I’m connected to the internet and I’ve gone through all the settings trying to resolve the problem. May have to do with the fact that I live outside the U.S.? This glitch (is it a glitch?) is annoying, but the app is so valuable I don’t care that much.","title":"The best app for lists.","userName":"MaryDriscoll"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3769287289","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-02-14T15:57:18Z","developerResponse":{"id":7305897,"body":"Thank you so much!

I have NEVER purchased an app until now; there are just too many that are free and I am a cheapo. This app, however, cannot be compared to any other. As a manager with hundreds of little things to keep up with, on top of having ADHD, the actions app is truly life changing! I’m also easily frustrated with complex technology; even though scheduling/customizing recurring reminders/tasks took a minute to figure out, the actions app is extremely easy to use! I used to just make lists in my notes app on my iPhone; now, I put EVERYTHING in my actions app!! You can make lists for anything, add notes to each task if needed, and you don’t have to schedule them until you’re ready. Speaking of scheduling, you can set a custom day for each task/reminder. You can also set reminders on the day of and head of time! \nI set recurring reminders that repeat monthly/weekly/yearly for bills, appointments, birthdays, etc. My lists are: Grocery, Order, To Do ASAP, To Do Later, Goals, Miscellaneous, \u0026 Work.

This app has helped keep me on track. Especially when people want to plan something I can take out my phone and type it quickly in the task app and then schedule for later. I love being to see the bigger picture of what I need to do for the week on the Timepage (calendar portion). Moleskin did a phenomenal job with ease of moving tasks to different days. I really like being able to move a task around to create priorities. It’s just easier seeing the list then having to write which is supper important. If I need to change the task or add to it, it’s super easy. It’s worth the annual subscription. Seriously worth the value to get all three apps in the bundle.\n\nThere is a free drawing app for people who like to doodle. I don’t but that’s not to take anything away from Moleskin.

I have had this app for almost two years now.  I also have their calendar app TimePage.  They both used to work pretty well.  As they add more and more stuff and functionality to be and look cooler, the bugs just increase.  Now it freezes every time I open it, it freezes in the middle of typing new actions (or new events in TimePage), syncing has just gotten worse and is also a daily problem (and I don’t even have an Apple watch), and actions that are supposed to repeat disappear.  I have an iPhone XS and a recent iPad Pro running the latest system updates.  Hardware and operating system is not the problem.  I have contacted the developer through support a number of times over the last 6 or so months.  Responses include questions and intentions and nothing gets better.  But here comes another update with more cool stuff!  Priority one is that it works flawlessly.  The cool additional stuff doesn’t matter until it just works.  Seems to be a theme with their apps - keep adding more stuff as basic performance degrades.  I have to question their testing protocols.  Perhaps we the customers are their testing protocol.\n\nThe apps has a 4.7 rating over it’s life.  Go sort reviews by most recent and make your own determination.\n\nThey are clearly pretty apps.

The widgets are fantastic and have revolutionized how I organize my phone and day. But there’s a huge fatal flaw...it does not sync with Apple Reminders. And it is a little bit clunky moving between the apps. What I really don’t understand is why Moleskine has Moleskine Journey which seems to compete with Timepage/Actions/Flow, but seamlessly puts all 3 functions together which is my primary complaint with the suite of apps...AND it *does* sync with Apple Reminders, so why doesn’t Actions? It would be amazing if they would marry the journal style functions of Journey with the rest of the suit, but as it is, it appears to be a standalone product that competes with their star product(s) Timepage/Actions/Flow. \n\nAdd Reminders syncing and full actions functionality in the time stream and it would be truly useful. I do like the 2 presentations of lists as either pages or cards, but I’d *really really* love to see them switch the project/list cards to little Moleskine notebooks that open with customizable cover artwork. In the page view, the chosen artwork could be the background for the action cards. \n\nI would love to see Moleskine combine Journey and the Timepage/Actions/Flow suite into one epic organization/productivity product to rule them all.","title":"Mixed feelings","userName":"dyan007"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3968265512","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-04-04T12:25:22Z","rating":4,"review":"I like this better than the Todoist app.  I love seeing what I’ve accomplished (crossed off) on my list which is a plus for goal oriented people. I am still in the trial and will post again when I purchase which I think I will do.  I also really appreciate the 7 day trial so I can get a feel for how often and the ease at which I interact with the app thru out my day.  I also really like the syncing of a calendar option.  It’s great to see both my day at a glance plus my todo list.  My only issue is that I use pocket life calendar to organize my entire family. There are specific color codes I give to events specific to that family member not just specific calendar as I use a family calendar. With the ACTIONS app you must use their TIMEFRAME calendar system (\u0026 pay again for that app) to sync the calendar u use to the App. Its more helpful to me to like to see my colors of the events rather than those of my specific calendars on the ACTIONS schedule page.  Is there a way it can sync to just the calendar I use or is it a platform thing that I have to get TIMEFRAME too?

You also have the ability to set up repeat tasks, which is nice, and I can use it to remind myself to check the mail or take meds, or anything that might easily slip my mind.  The only things I kind of wish were available are things like sub-tasks (I don’t want to make a separate item for everything I need to do to do to clean the kitchen, but it would be nice to be able to make a checklist) and being able to hide certain tasks from what ends up being a massive to-do list.  I use the app to remind myself and keep track of taking medications (I can easily look back and make sure I took them when I was supposed to), but it would be nice if I could hide those, and other little things like it, until the reminder time so that they don’t clutter up the list throughout the day.

As a high schools AP student, I find that this app was very helpful and kept me organized so when the trial was up, I signed up for the monthly subscription. On the subscription screen, when I pressed continue, a pop up read that I needed to verify my credit card info in my settings. When I pressed continued on the pop up, it directed me to the app store asking for my credit card info. It then redirected me to my settings, and then to the apple ID website. I saw that none of these methods were working. Typing in my credit card info multiple times, my subscription was unsuccessful. I tried to re-enter my credit card info more than 3 times and kept taking me through the same process. I am though, very aware that this could be an issue with apple as well. But I really like this app and I’m highly disappointed that my subscription isn’t processing.

I run Actions on a brand new iPad Pro, and the performance is worse after the update;  the app now lags for almost 60 seconds before updating simple task changes like a reminder time change.  Moleskine has been promising for a YEAR that a version for Mac OS/Web is coming so we can actually see our tasks across all devices, and they have gone radio-silent and that version is still not released.  And, Actions STILL cannot sync with iCloud reminders.  So, while I think there are some apps that can ethically-justify charging a subscription fee to defray the costs of continuously-improving the app, Actions is NOT one of them.  I would discourage anyone not already using this buggy app from starting to use it now.  I hope Moleskine gets their act together because the app has a lot of potential, but it just doesn’t work well now.","title":"Getting worse instead of
