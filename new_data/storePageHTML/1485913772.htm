    AMAZING content— the app is another story

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>(I will preface this by saying I am a former journalist who now works on a UX team, so my feedback is from both a personal and professional standpoint!) I absolutely love Wondery and truly believe this is best team of storytellers out there. The hosts are engaging, informative and creative, and the shows encompass an excellent variety of topics. It is clear the group works REALLY hard to deliver fresh content regularly. The music tracks are nice/not overpowering, the editing is clean, and I find the overall production quality strong, which is so impressive in the era of at-home recording. I was pumped when the app was rolled out because I devour Wondery episodes and wanted to ditch the ads (I do enjoy this perk of the subscription). However, the app is buggy and glitchy. I have to close and relaunch it multiple times per day, sometimes hourly. Playback stalls constantly, shows do not necessarily automatically resume, and the layout/navigation is not intuitive. I do a lot of fumbling and clicking. I think some simple user testing and validation would go a long way in improving the experience, so I have no doubt the developers will continue iterating and improving. For now, though, while they work out the kinks, I am not sure if the value matches the price point. I will conclude by saying it pains me, a total Wondery fanatic, to leave a less-than-glowing review here. BUT, I know the team will nail it, just like they do everything else!</p>

    Great content, terrible app

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I want to like this app. I really do. But it’s a hot mess! Several issues plague this app that don’t effect other podcast players. Here’s a few;<br /><br />You’re listening to a podcast &amp; you get a call, the app doesn’t pause &amp; resume after the call. Oh no. It resets itself &amp; you have to reload it from the start. If you’re lucky the show you were listening to held its place. Pause a show to look up something? Full reset. Stay paused for too long? Yep full reset. Here’s another issue. The fast forward &amp; rewind buttons don’t work when playing. You can literally wind up anywhere in a shows timeline if you make the mistake of touching those buttons. The content gets scattered all over the home screen of the app with no sense of organization. It won’t save a playlist of shows you’re listening to. No notifications of new episodes so you have to keep checking. I could go on but it’s in several reviews already. Just read up.  Bottom line... I got the subscriber feed from the website &amp; just downloaded them from there in another player. I love the content. The shows are fantastic. I’m a subscriber. But this app isn’t worth the trouble. <br /><br />Fix this Wondery!!!</p>

    Echoing Robert Whites review

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I was prepped to pay for the content. I really enjoy some of their podcasts. I got so frustrated during my free trial that I cancelled early. Podcasts starting over after anything happens in iOS was already enough to put me over the top.  But another super irritating thing is I listen at 1.5x most the time and that would reset and you’d have to cycle back through the speeds to get it fixed but if you do that too fast it wouldn’t pick it up right. It’s like the state management in this app is completely an afterthought. I’m usually pretty forgiving as I myself am a software developer but it’s like there was zero testing done on the features that exist. <br /><br />I think the primary reason I ended up dropping the subscription and why I’m writing this review is because most people listen to podcasts while driving and this app effectively makes it unsafe to use unless you’re okay listening to the same episode repeatedly and slowly due to all the bugs. <br /><br />I’m honestly stunned the app has over 4 stars in aggregate. It currently fails as a podcast player which is a shame because the content is excellent.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi WeAreOnePeople - thanks for the feedback. We&#39;ve fixed the issues you&#39;ve described, including preserving speed settings across sessions and across multiple episodes in the same listening session. We&#39;re also hard are work on many other performance and functional improvements. If you have tried the app again and have more feedback, we&#39;d love to hear about it - you can drop us a line anytime at support@wondery.com and we&#39;ll dig in ASAP. </p>

You have arrived at wondery.com and/or are otherwise interacting with our Service (defined below), which is owned and operated by Wondery Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Wondery” or “we,” “our” or “us“). This Privacy Policy governs your use of any online service location (including, without limitation, both mobile and online versions) that posts a link to this Privacy Policy (each a “Site” except when we refer only to our mobile apps, in which case an “App“), and also applies to your use of interactive features, widgets, plug-ins, applications, content, downloads and/or other services that we own and control and make available through a Site and/or that posts a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Service“), regardless of how you access or use them, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise, but does not apply to data we receive from third parties, except to the extent we combine such data with Personal Information (defined below) that we have ourselves collected under this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to our data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of our Service (unless otherwise stated below), and does not govern the data practices of third parties that may interact with our Service. Also, it is limited to our practices and our Service includes access to third party content and services we do not control. Consult their privacy policies regarding their practices.\n\nTo the extent we provide you notice on our Service of different or additional privacy policies or practices (e.g., at the point of our collection), those additional terms shall govern such data collection and use.\n\nIn addition, please review the Service’s Terms of Service, which governs your use of the Service, and includes, among other things, grants of rights from you, limits on our liability and your remedies, mandatory arbitration, and waiver of jury trial and class actions. By using our Service, you agree to our Terms of Service and consent to our collection, use and sharing of your information and data, and other activities, as described below.\n\nWHAT INFORMATION DOES THE SERVICE COLLECT?\na. Information About You That You Provide to Us\n\nPersonal Information and Demographic Information. On the Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, and home address (“Personal Information“); and (2) demographic information, such as information about your gender, age, zip code, country, company name, and company type (“Demographic Information“). We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service, including at registration, newsletter sign-up forms, “contact us” forms, or when you otherwise interact with the Service. To the extent we combine Demographic Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.\n\nb. Information Collected or Stored As You Access and Use the Service Generally.\n\nIn addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Service (“Usage Information“). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone, or other device (a “Device“) whenever you visit or interact with our Service. To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat such combined data as Personal Information, but we do not otherwise treat it (including UIDs (defined below) as Personal Information (i.e., we treat it as Non-Personal Information), except to the extent required by applicable law.\n\nThis Usage Information may include:\n\nyour IP address, UDID, advertising identifier, device identifier or other unique identifier (“UID“). A device identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its device identifier;\nclickstream data reflecting the information you enter and the selections you make while using the Service;\nyour Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);\nthe URL that referred you to our Service;\nthe areas within our Service that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;\nyour Device location;\nyour Device characteristics; and\ncertain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.\nTracking Technologies. We may use now and hereafter known methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (“Tracking Technologies“). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed): Cookies, Web Beacons, Embedded Scripts, Browser Fingerprinting, Etags, Recognition Technologies, and in-App Tracking.\n\nCookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Service. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. To identify local shared objects on your computer and adjust your settings, please visit: www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html\n\nWeb Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs,” “Pixel Tags,” or “Web Bugs”) may be included in our Service’s pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.\n\nEmbedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.\n\nBrowser Fingerprinting. Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.\n\nETag, or Entity Tag. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of UID. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.\n\nRecognition Technologies. Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household).\n\nIn-app Tracking Methods. There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user activity to a particular app.\n\nThere may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Service.\n\nTracking Technologies Choices and Consent.\n\nWe are giving you detailed notice of the Tracking Technologies and your limited choices regarding them so that your consent is meaningfully informed. For more information on your choices regarding Tracking Technologies, see Section 6 and Section 7 below.\n\nThird Party Tracking and Do Not Track.\n\nThird parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Service, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them. However, you consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Service. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third-parties and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect. The relevant third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties. For more information on our vendors, and their Tracking Technologies, click here. For more information on advertising and advertisers, and related Tracking Technologies, click here. For more information on your choices regarding Tracking Technologies click here.\n\nAlso, various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms known as “do not track signals”. For instance, some browsers may have such signal options, though they differ as to if the signal is set as default or must be turned on by the user. Further, there is not yet an industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms, though we may consider doing so if an understandable and practical standard is developed and widely adopted. For more information on “do not track” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.\n\nc. Information Third Parties Provide About You\n\nWe may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Service, such as when they submit content to us or post on the Service. Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Service with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. To the extent we combine information we receive from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Service, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise. In no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.\n\nd. Third-Party Content and Services\n\nThe Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and a third-party web site, platform, tool, application or other service, and accessing or display of third-party content via the Service (“Third Party Services“).

Except where prohibited by applicable law, we may share your UIDs with third parties along with data (other than Personal Information) related to you and your activities as non-Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

However, we do not guarantee that your setting selections will be effective immediately or be error free when delivering social content and advertisements.

Certain areas of the Service may be provided to you in association with third parties (“Co-Branded Areas“) (such as sponsors, charities, and political organizations) and may require you to disclose Personal Information to them. Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party and indicate if they have a privacy policy that applies to their collection and use of you information. If you elect to register for products and/or services, communicate with such third parties or download their content or applications, at Co-Branded Areas, you may be providing your information to both us and the third party. Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Area with a username and password obtained on the Service, your Personal Information may be disclosed to the identified third parties for that Co-Branded Area.

Others may have access to this User-Generated Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Information, in connection with your User-Generated Content. Please note that Wondery does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure.

For full terms and conditions regarding User-Generated Content you submit to the Service, please review our Terms of Service.\n\nd. Profiles. We may offer registered users of the Service a profile page. A user’s profile page may be, by default, set up to display information such as the user’s display name, images, location (city/state/country), podcasts, company, and optional information added by the user including, for example, the user’s tagline, etc. We may make it possible for users to see a report on other users that visited a profile page and this gives users access to such visitor’s profile pages. Profile information is used by us primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the Service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information on the Service. In some cases (e.g., posting to your page), other users of the Service may be able to supplement your profile. We may offer users the ability to manage their public profile and use profile preference settings as explained at Section 7, the functionality and features of which are subject to change from time-to-time so visit it frequently to confirm the settings reflect your then current preferences and we recommend that you do not post information or content as part of your profile that you are not prepared to make public. Changing setting options may not result in immediate changes to the settings, which are subject to our operations and maintenance schedules. Users should carefully consider the use of such settings to improve information display options and to ensure the settings are properly set and functioning in the manner desired. Notwithstanding the availability of profile preference settings, you should be aware that these settings are for convenience only, do not employ complex data security protection and may not be error free. Further, other users that have access may repost or otherwise make public your information or content. Accordingly, discretion and good judgment should be exercised when posting information or content as part of your profile.\n\nThe Service may permit you to submit ideas, photographs, user profiles, writings, music, video, audio recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions or other content (collectively, “User-Generated Content“). We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User-Generated Content or Personal Information that you disclose or receive from third parties through the Service. We are not responsible for any User-Generated Content or Personal Information you submit to third party services via our Service. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Information, in connection with your User-Generated Content.\n\n5. DO THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, AND/OR THIRD-PARTY APPS APPEAR ON THE SERVICE?\n\nThe Service may contain content that is supplied by a Third Party Operator, and those third parties may collect Usage Data and your UID when such content is served to you. Third Party Services may also be available via the Service. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by such third parties or their services and they may be collecting data about you and may be sharing it with us and/or others. These third parties and their services may also associate their Tracking Technologies with you, track you across sites and time, serve you their own ads (including Interest-based Ads (defined below)) and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.\n\nIn addition, when you are on the Service you may be directed to other services that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. For example, if you “click” on a link, the “click” may take you off the Service onto a different site. We encourage you to note when you leave our Service and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party locations and exercise caution in connection with them.\n\nBe sure to review any available privacy policies and notices before submitting any Personal Information to a third party or its services, or otherwise interacting with Third Party Services or other locations you link to from our Service, and exercise caution in connection with them. We are not responsible for the availability, completeness or accuracy of such third parties’ policies or notices.\n\n6. ARE ADS SERVED ON THE SERVICE OR RETARGETED TO ME LATER?\n\nWondery may engage and work with third parties to serve advertisements on Wondery’s behalf on the Service, and/or on Third Party Services, and to provide analytics about the use of the Service and the performance of Wondery’s ads and content on the Service and on Third Party Services. In addition, Wondery may participate in online advertising networks and exchanges that display relevant advertisements to the Wondery visitors, on the Service and on Third Party Services, based on user interests as reflected in their browsing of the Service and certain Third Party Services. These entities may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to automatically collect information about you and your activities, such as registering a unique identifier for your device and tying that to your online activities on and off of the Service. Wondery may use this information to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on the Service and Third Party Services and better understand your online activity.\n\nSome information about your use of the Service and certain Third Party Services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by Wondery and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant and retargeted ads (“Interest-based Ads“) and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third Party Services. You may have certain choices regarding these activities as explained in the next section.\n\nWondery is not responsible for third parties or Third Party Services associated with advertising and analytics services, and related tracking activities. Consult their privacy policies and notices for information on their practices and see Section 7 regarding certain choices some of them may offer you. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, Wondery currently does not alter Wondery’s practices when Wondery receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. For more information on tracking and “do not track,” see Section 1(b).\n\nIn addition, we may serve ads on third party services that are targeted to reach people on those services that are also identified on one of more of our databases (“Matched List Ads“). This is done by matching common factors between our databases and the databases of Third Party Operators. For instance, we may use such ad services offered by Facebook or Twitter. If we use Facebook to serve Matched List Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such a Facebook ad and find out how to opt-out with us from such list. If you opt-out from our Facebook Matched List Ads, we will remove the matching Personal Information from that list, however, this will not take effect immediately and if you have multiple e-mails or other accounts you may have to opt-out separately for each one. If we use Twitter Matched Use Ads, you should be able to opt-out through your account settings on Twitter. If you opt-out from our Twitter Matched Use Ads, you will be removed from that list, however, this will not take effect immediately and if you have multiple e-mails or other accounts you may have to opt-out separately for each one. We are not responsible for such third party services’ failure to comply with your or our opt-out instructions or to provide us notice of your opt-out elections, and they may change their options without notice to us or you.\n\n7. HOW DO I EXERCISE CHOICE AND CHANGE PREFERENCES?\n\na. Accessing And Changing Information.\n\nThe Service may provide web pages or other mechanisms allowing you to delete, correct or update some of the Personal Information you have provided Wondery. Wondery will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in Wondery’s then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your information or public postings from Wondery’s databases (California minors see Section 9) and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter. Further, we reserve the right to retain data (i) as required by applicable law; and (ii) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained as permitted by applicable law (e.g., business records).\n\nb. Tracking Technologies Generally.\n\nRegular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies or other Tracking Technologies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.\n\nApp-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can be disabled by uninstalling the App. To uninstall an App, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer. In addition, you may have certain choices regarding in-app Interest-based Advertising as described in the next section.\n\nSome third parties may also offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies. One way to potentially identify cookies on our Site is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your browser (www.ghostery.com), which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-based cookies associated with the web sites (but not mobile apps) you visit and privacy and opt-out policies and options of the parties operating those cookies. Wondery is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this tool or third party choice notices or mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.\n\nc. Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising.\n\nWondery may use Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics or other Service Providers for analytics services. These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help Wondery analyze how users use the Service. Information generated by these services (e.g., your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics and other Service Providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these Service Providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and other Internet usage. Wondery only retains aggregated data from Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Adobe Analytics by going to http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html under the section labeled “Tell our customers not to measure your use of their websites or tailor their online ads for you.”\n\nCertain companies may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA“) AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for Interest-based Ads that links to an opt-out tool which allows you to exercise certain choices regarding targeting. You can learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program at http://www.youradchoices.com/ and its opt-out program for mobile apps at http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices. In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI“). NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of certain Interest-based Ads delivered by NAI members’ ad networks. To learn more about opting out of such targeted advertising or to use the NAI tool, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Ads, you will continue to receive non-targeted ads. Further, opting out of one or more NAI or DAA members only means that those selected members should no longer under the DAA / NAI rules deliver certain targeted ads to you. This will affect this and other services, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or web browser(s), or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Mobile device opt-outs will not affect browser-based Interest-based Ads even on the same device, and you must opt-out separately for each device. Wondery is not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. However, Wondery supports the ad industry’s 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising(http://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf) and expect that ad networks Wondery directly engages to serve you Interest-based Ads will do so as well, though Wondery cannot guaranty their compliance.\n\nd. Mobile Apps.\n\nWith respect to Wondery’s Apps, you can stop all collection of information by uninstalling the App. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device. See also the prior section regarding in-App Interest-based Ads choices.\n\ne. Communications and Marketing.\n\nYou can opt out of receiving certain promotional communications (emails or text messaging) from Wondery at any time by (i) for promotional e-mails, by following the instructions as provided in emails to click on the unsubscribe link, or if available by changing your communication preferences by logging onto your account; and (ii) for text messages, by following the instructions as provided in text messages from Wondery to text the word, “STOP”. Please note that your opt-out is limited to the e-mail address or phone number used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions. If you opt-out of only certain communications, other subscriptions may continue. Even if you opt out of receiving promotional communications, Wondery may, subject to applicable law, continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing, or Wondery’s ongoing business relations. California residents have certain rights regarding our sharing of certain of their personal information with third parties for third party direct marketing purposes, as explained in Section 3(i).\n\n8. WHAT ABOUT TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES?\n\nOur Service is operated in the United States and intended for users located in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including Personal Information, will be transferred to, and processed, stored and used in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. By using the Service or providing us with any information, you consent to the transfer to, and processing, usage, sharing and storage of your information, including Personal Information, in the United States as set forth in this Privacy Policy.\n\n9. WHAT PARENTS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT CHILDREN?\n\nWe understand the importance of protecting children’s privacy in the interactive world. We are a general audience service and do not use the Service to knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13) that requires parental notice and consent under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA“) without such parental consent. If you are a child under thirteen (13) years of age, you are not permitted to use the Service and should not send any information about yourself to us through the Service.\n\nIn the event that we become aware that we have collected personal information from any child, we will dispose of that information, or otherwise treat it, in accordance with COPPA and other applicable laws and regulations. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided us with personal information without COPPA-required consent, please contact us here.\n\nAny California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Service, and who have posted content or information on the Service, can request that such information be removed from the Service by contacting us at the e-mail or address set forth in the “Contact us” section below making such a request, stating that they personally posted such content or information and detailing where the content or information is posted. We will make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third-parties may have republished the post and archived copies of it may be stored by search engines and others that we do not control.\n\n10.

I absolutely love Wondery and truly believe this is best team of storytellers out there. The hosts are engaging, informative and creative, and the shows encompass an excellent variety of topics. It is clear the group works REALLY hard to deliver fresh content regularly. The music tracks are nice/not overpowering, the editing is clean, and I find the overall production quality strong, which is so impressive in the era of at-home recording. I was pumped when the app was rolled out because I devour Wondery episodes and wanted to ditch the ads (I do enjoy this perk of the subscription). However, the app is buggy and glitchy. I have to close and relaunch it multiple times per day, sometimes hourly. Playback stalls constantly, shows do not necessarily automatically resume, and the layout/navigation is not intuitive. I do a lot of fumbling and clicking. I think some simple user testing and validation would go a long way in improving the experience, so I have no doubt the developers will continue iterating and improving. For now, though, while they work out the kinks, I am not sure if the value matches the price point. I will conclude by saying it pains me, a total Wondery fanatic, to leave a less-than-glowing review here.

If you’re lucky the show you were listening to held its place. Pause a show to look up something? Full reset. Stay paused for too long? Yep full reset. Here’s another issue. The fast forward \u0026 rewind buttons don’t work when playing. You can literally wind up anywhere in a shows timeline if you make the mistake of touching those buttons. The content gets scattered all over the home screen of the app with no sense of organization. It won’t save a playlist of shows you’re listening to. No notifications of new episodes so you have to keep checking. I could go on but it’s in several reviews already. Just read up.  Bottom line...

Podcasts starting over after anything happens in iOS was already enough to put me over the top.  But another super irritating thing is I listen at 1.5x most the time and that would reset and you’d have to cycle back through the speeds to get it fixed but if you do that too fast it wouldn’t pick it up right. It’s like the state management in this app is completely an afterthought. I’m usually pretty forgiving as I myself am a software developer but it’s like there was zero testing done on the features that exist. \n\nI think the primary reason I ended up dropping the subscription and why I’m writing this review is because most people listen to podcasts while driving and this app effectively makes it unsafe to use unless you’re okay listening to the same episode repeatedly and slowly due to all the bugs. \n\nI’m honestly stunned the app has over 4 stars in aggregate.

It seems to be, primarily, an advertisement for podcasts I don’t listen to, advertising that complicates my ability to enjoy the podcasts I do. The app is not as slow or bloated as it once was. Many of the issues identified in previous two-star reveiws have been fixed. Nevertheless, using this applciation remains a mystifying slog. I discover new frustrations. Most recently, I have found that the latest episode of a podcast disappears for a week after I listen to it... even if I fall asleep and don’t actually hear the end of the episode. I cannot find the episode until the next episode is released. There is no (obvious) way to set a sleep timer or review a listening history, features that seem to be routinely included in other podcast applications. The general problem seems to be a focus on aesthetics and advertising over functionality and all the bug-squashing in the world won’t fix that approach to app design.","title":"Pretty, but I’d rather hear ads than use this app","userName":"BGR714"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6424657588","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-13T11:33:07Z","developerResponse":{"id":17879102,"body":"We're sorry for the trouble, but we appreciate your feedback.

There is also just little stuff that works really poorly—if I’m using it at the same time as google maps, it doesn’t pause when that app takes over audio to give directions. Every other podcast app can do this! Some even rewind a second so you don’t lose context on resumption. This is made even worse because the 15 second rewind button on the lock screen rarely works. \n\nAll in all, I’ll probably go back to Apple Podcasts and deal with the ads.

I want to get that out of the way. This isn’t a review of a single show or related to multiple shows. I enjoy most of Wondery content. I also wouldn’t have these complaints if they didn’t make you pay for it.\n\nThis review is based on their app entirely:\n\n1) The app constantly restarts itself and is worthless as far as getting out of the car and getting back in. Every other audio app I have picks up where it left off on car restart. Wondery shuts itself down and you have to restart it on your phone at each stop...then navigate their interface...each time. As when it restarts, it resets what you were listening to previously.\n2) This doesn’t help since, their start screen doesn’t make it easy to get back to the show you were on.\n3) It also doesn’t help as they push “episodes” over shows so you have to start an episode in order to mute it just to repeatedly click on the title of the program to get to an episode list. Why is it so difficult? Just let me have a quick option to go to shows I listen to if you won’t allow continued listening.\n4) I like the Wondery productions, but this app is very flawed. I just want someone who is looking through reviews to know, before they purchase a subscription, that the app will give you more grief than it’s worth.

Every time I open the app, the player displays the very first podcast series I listened to on Wondery (like 6 shows ago!) and it takes a few minutes for it to refresh. Pretty much anything I do, rewind, try to read episode details, go back to home screen, there is a delay OR more times than not it just freezes and I have to restart app and then go through a series of frustrating deejays to get back to up where I was (which I usually can't). For awhile there it. would freeze 2 min before the end of each episode and because the fast forward doesn't work, I'd end up having to listen to about 10 min I'd already heard. The content is totally up my alley... But I want to smash Wondery thru my phone at least three times an episode. I'm on a free trial now but don't think I can justify paying a monthly fee for this... Total bummer!!","title":"Like others, love content but SO BUGGY","userName":"Laura in the Berkshires"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6323538628","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-08-15T20:22:50Z","developerResponse":{"id":17433078,"body":"Thanks for trying the app and for your detailed feedback.

There are several podcast apps and audioplayer apps that offer speed up in increments of .1. A lot of the time 1.3 or 1.4 is perfect when listening to Wondery podcasts on other apps. I really don’t understand the limited options especially from a brand as professional as Wondery.\n\nSomething else that is very frustrating, is that when you play back episodes on the continuous setting where the next one automatically plays, if you had the speed set to 1.25x the next episode starts playing at 1x speed even though it shows that it’s 1.25. I thought maybe I was crazy so I played something through the end at 1.75x and the next episode automatically started but it was at 1x, not 1.75 as the app was showing. So every time a new episode starts I have to stop what I’m doing, go back to the app and click through the speeds one time until it resets and starts speeding up again. \n\nIf these issues are addressed and rectified, I would 100% become a long term subscriber. Until then, I’ll probably listen in another app at an optimal speed. It’s not worth the headache and optimal speed is so important to me.","title":"The podcasts are good, but...","userName":"ktb224"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7194847018","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-04-07T16:30:58Z","developerResponse":{"id":22153326,"body":"Thanks for trying the app and we certainly are sorry for the inconvenience.

Want to binge? Be prepared to restart the app multiple times. Clearly the “premium” I’m paying for is the content and not the listening experience. I feel lucky to get through a 25 minute episode and that’s not the kind of feeling I want from a podcast player. This does not happen with any other major podcast app. \n\nI don’t want to think about if I’m in the mood to be yanked out of a story when I’m in the mood for a story. And that’s ultimately what I have to consider every time I think about launching this app. Which sometimes leads me to other non-Wondery content. \n\nThe app owes the content an apology. I’m not asking it to do super fancy superfluous things. I’m asking it to play an audio file without consistently crashing. That’s it. And how bad is it that inconsistent crashing would be an improvement?","title":"Content? Awesome. App?

I subscribed to Wondery so I could download shows to listen to while I was out of service ... no wi-fi, no internet, no nothing ... in the bowels of the Alaskan wilderness. Imagine how disappointed I was to be in the wilderness and try to listen to my “Downloaded Episodes” but noooo ... Wondery wanted me to log in, like I’d never logged in before or even used the app.  Ok, no problem ... I’ll play their silly game and log in again EXCEPT since I wasn’t on-line, logging in is impossible and you get the message, “an error occurred.”\n\nSo I got NOTHING!!! I’d already signed in when I was in civilization so why Wondery needed me to sign in again is beyond me. The second I got BACK into service,\nWondery didn’t ask me to sign in ... it just automatically connected me (as it should no matter where I am!!)\n\nAnother HUGE negative to this app is that EVERY time you launch it, it searches and searches and searches FOREVER before you’ll see anything to listen to. Even if I’m using the Wondery app but switch to any other app (say, I want to look at my texts) switching back to Wondery starts the whole process over again. Fifteen seconds AT LEAST while it “boots up” again. If you don’t leave Wondery in the foreground 100% of the time and do NOTHING ELSE on your phone, it’ll be like the first time you’ve opened the app ... and the process starts all over. \n\nJust HORRIBLE.
