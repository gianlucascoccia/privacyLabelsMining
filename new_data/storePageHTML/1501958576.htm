        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>New 8-bit Mario theme to freshen up your watchface. Give it a go!<br /><br />And before that?<br />Please welcome Open-Meteo, an up-and-coming indie forecast service combining global models with local services, with great precision in Europe and North America.<br /><br />NOWCAST! Realtime rain &amp; snow forecast updated every 15 minutes.<br />If a rain or snow is expected during the next 3 hours, you will get a notice on a large complication, and a detailed 3-hour precipitation chart in the app.<br />Nowcast is powered by Foreca, and depends on precision of rain radars in your area. Available for Weathergraph Pro users.<br /><br />Plus:<br />- Apple Watch 7 support<br />- Added a time of upcoming rain or snow in text form<br />- Gradient Black theme is now more colorful and looks dope<br />- New 2.5 days range is ideal for seeing today and next two days (thank you, Jörgen!)<br />- Scrolling chart with crown (just tap it and scroll) is smoother and shows the actually displayed range. Try also tapping the chart multiple times to zoom in &amp; out quickly.<br />- Foreca — a premium forecast source with a renowned worldwide accuracy coming up to your wrist. Set it up in preferences, and enjoy precise forecast.<br />- &quot;3.2 mm rain and 7 mm snow in the next 24 hours.&quot; — See how much of trouble will be the upcoming precipitation with the precipitation summary.<br />- Precipitation chart now considers even small peaks of rain/snow that would happen in between the bars, that would have been missed previously. More precision for everyone!<br />- Added a touch of color to make always-on-display nicer<br />- Texts now read a bit smoother (like &#39;light rain, picking up&#39;)<br />- Allow maximum zoom (up to 7 days with fresh data)<br />- Lot of bugfixes, including stabler background updates &amp; always-on-display support in app<br /><br />And going way back?<br /><br />Fixed problems with restore for everyone, who upgraded subscriptions. Thank you for your patience!<br /><br />Smoother sounding texts — will you notice? :)<br /><br />Zoom &amp; scroll<br />- Independent zoom for complication and app. Need to see next day on your watchface, and three day outlook in the app? Now you can :)<br />- Tap the chart, and turn the digital crown to zoom to quickly see what&#39;s coming up<br />- Tap the chart multiple times to quickly peek to next five days (when zoomed in) or to next day (when zoomed out)<br /><br />Blind friendly Weathergraph<br />- Reading forecast with VoiceOver now produces really natural sounding text. Thank you for help, Tony! (I would love having the forecast read when tapping the complication, but this needs fixing from Apple — right now, Apple Watch will only read complication name)<br /><br />An universe of complications, new look, and many tweaks<br />- Turn the watchface into a meteorological station. Conditions, temperature (real or feel), precipitation, wind speed + direction, humidity and dew point.<br /><br />Larger edge-to-edge graphic complications<br /><br />New color-tinted complication theme &amp; improved visuals<br />- Graphical complication now looks 200 % more beautiful on color-tinted watchfaces. Have a try!<br />- All themes are subtly better and more readable.<br /><br />Better text summary. Space-saving layout. Km/h option.<br />- Text summary now tells how long will current conditions stay and what will come next.<br /><br />Sunrise/sunset. Juicier themes. One-time payment option.<br />- Added sunrise and sunset times.<br />- Option to unlock all features with a single one-time payment for anyone who doesn&#39;t like subscriptions, yay!<br />- Better for commuters — when the location is more than 15 km away from a last update, the forecast will update automatically (so that you can arrive to work and have a local weather up to date).</p>

Thank you Mary Ann, Tomas<br /><br />Hello Mary Ann, could you please write me at support@tomaskafka.com? I&#39;ll be glad to look into this with you.<br /><br />Double tap when purchasing is meant to mean double clicking the bottom side button of your watch - that&#39;s why the button on screen is drawn to look &#39;half outside the screen&#39;.</p>

    Wonderful watch weather app!

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is a truly great weather app for your watch. I began to use it because my other weather apps on the watch seemed to always be “updating” when I went to look at them, and weathergraph always had data. It might be 10 mins old, but on my watch that’s fine. If I want totally the most detailed forecast I’ll use one of my 6 favorite weather apps on my phone. Even when weathergraph is updating it still has data available to look at. <br /><br />After a bit I began to appreciate the amount of useful data that is shown on the screen. I get temperature, wind, precipitation at a glance, for one day or five days. I also get cloud cover, something you don’t get easily even on phone apps. I also get sunrise and sunset. All instantly available. When using my watch I usually just want an overview of today or tomorrow, and I get far more than that with weathergraph. It has taken me a few weeks to really appreciate the quantity of information offered by weathergraph and get used to reading it at a glance.<br /><br />I have several weather apps on my watch, and quite a few more on my phone, but I get more information more regularly from weathergraph than all of the others.   This is a great app, and I’m so happy to have it!</p>

I began to use it because my other weather apps on the watch seemed to always be “updating” when I went to look at them, and weathergraph always had data. It might be 10 mins old, but on my watch that’s fine. If I want totally the most detailed forecast I’ll use one of my 6 favorite weather apps on my phone. Even when weathergraph is updating it still has data available to look at. \n\nAfter a bit I began to appreciate the amount of useful data that is shown on the screen. I get temperature, wind, precipitation at a glance, for one day or five days. I also get cloud cover, something you don’t get easily even on phone apps. I also get sunrise and sunset. All instantly available. When using my watch I usually just want an overview of today or tomorrow, and I get far more than that with weathergraph. It has taken me a few weeks to really appreciate the quantity of information offered by weathergraph and get used to reading it at a glance.\n\nI have several weather apps on my watch, and quite a few more on my phone, but I get more information more regularly from weathergraph than all of the others.

Now you can :)\n\nAn universe of complications, new look, and many tweaks\n- Many new complications let you turn the watchface into a meteorological station. Conditions, temperature (real or feel), precipitation, wind speed + direction, humidity and dew point.\n- Visual refresh of charts - sharper colors and many improved details (like raindrops that now mark rain)\n- Brand new look\n- Reworked background sync for more regular and bug-free weather updates\n\nLarger graphic complication for WatchOS 7\n- New OS allows for larger, edge-to-edge graphic complications\n- Option to show min/max temp on a complication instead of summary\n- Option to show full size graph without any text\n\nNew color-tinted complication theme \u0026 improved visuals\n- Graphical complication now looks 200 % more beautiful on color-tinted watchfaces. Have a try!\n- All themes are subtly better and more readable.\n\nBetter text summary. Space-saving layout. Km/h option.\n- Text summary now tells how long will current conditions stay and what will come next. This also makes large Modular complication much better :).\n- Tighter layout to fit more data onto first screen without scrolling.\n- And km/h wind speed option - thank you, Duilio.\n\nSunrise/sunset. Juicier themes. One-time payment option.\n- Added sunrise and sunset times.\n- Graphical refresh of all themes, especially the bright ones - they now look subtly juicier.\n- Option to unlock all features with a single one-time payment for anyone who doesn't like subscriptions, yay!\n- Better for commuters — when the location is more than 15 km away from a last update, the forecast will update automatically (so that you can arrive to work and have a local weather up to date).\n\nAnd before that:\n- Humidity and dew point graph, for all skin-sensitive people out there!\n- Option for US units - °F, mph wind, inches for rain, 12/24 hour scale according to watch settings.\n- Also, smoothed out and nicer weather curves\n- Secret screen with an option to send logs when solving problems with the app (if you have problems with restore, contact me at support@tomaskafka.com and I'll guide you).\n- Weathergraph now shows weather condition instead of city name on a graphic complication. Also, better texts for Modular watchface.\n- New Neon theme for all Tron movie lovers out there!\n- Wind direction for Pro users! See both wind speed and direction in a new visualization.\n- Added more temperature measurements to 1 and 2-day views.","releaseDate":"2021-05-23"},{"versionDisplay":"1.0.41","releaseNotes":"Smoother sounding texts - will you notice? :)\n\nRestoring purchases should now restore all purchases - please accept my apologies for this problem, especially if you have upgraded your subscription, and it didn't restore to a new watch.
