You can also buy the app outright with a single in-app purchase.** \n\nHalide is an App Store Editor's Choice, award-winning camera from the team behind Spectre, Apple's App of the Year of 2019. Its multitude of awards include iMore's \"App of the Year 2020,\" Macworld's \"Must Have Apps,\" The Verge's \"Apps We Love,\" and The Sweet Setup's \"Best Third-Party Camera App for iPhone.\"\n\nHalide is the most powerful camera for iPhone with the most elegant, simple design — A pro camera for everyone.\n\nThis is a groundbreaking app for deliberate and thoughtful photography. With high-end tools, and a beautiful interface designed from scratch for the latest iPhones and inspired by the controls of professional cameras, Halide is your go-to camera when you want to really take a photo rather than a quick snapshot.\n\nUse gestures in Halide to change exposure and manual focus with a swipe, or switch from its powerful automatic mode to manual shooting. Halide’s professional tools are the most powerful in the App Store, with XDR (Extended Dynamic Range) 14-bit RAW streaming waveform views, color zebras, focus assists like focus peaking and loupe, histograms, an adaptive level grid, and manual depth capture. Customize controls to adapt the app to your needs.\n\nHalide’s ProRAW support* is unmatched. Strike the right balance between file size and editing latitude by choosing between 12-bit and 10-bit ProRAW, with or without JPEG sidecars.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>We have a few fixes for you fine folks. This update addresses...<br /> <br />* A potential crash on iOS 15.1 that can occur when granting limited access to your photo library<br />* A potential crash on older devices when capturing in Macro Mode with 3x magnification<br />* An issue where you get prompted for camera permissions the moment you launch the app for the first time<br />* A few updated translations<br /> <br />Our next big update is going well, and we can&#39;t wait to get it into your hands. In the mean time, we&#39;d love to keep hearing your feedback! Just email support@lux.camera.<br /><br />---<br /><br />HALIDE 2.5: A BIG DAY FOR SMALL THINGS<br /><br />Did you know? The latest iPhone 13 Pro takes amazing Macro shots. That got us pretty excited. But we also wanted *everyone* to be excited about taking great Macro photos.<br /><br />So we created Macro Mode.<br /><br />Halide now offers the best tool for close-up photos on any iPhone, and the perfect companion for the iPhone 13 Pro’s new near-focusing camera: Macro Mode!<br /><br />Macro Mode is helped by our new technology called Neural Macro. Halide’s Macro Mode does a few clever things to help you get the best Macro shot: first, it checks which one of your cameras can focus the closest. Then, it gives you ultra-precise focus control to get your teeny-tiny subject perfectly sharp. Finally, once taken, Neural Macro gets to work: a powerful AI-based detail enhancement process gets even more detail out of your processed image.<br /><br />To turn on Macro Mode, first tap the AF button to get into manual focus, and then tap the flower button. When activated, Halide switches to the lens on your phone with the closest focus distance. It also increases the size of the focus dial, allowing granular adustments down to the millimeter.<br /><br />Shooting with the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro lens, you’ll often find yourself cropping images due to its ultra-wide field of field. There’s just one problem: if you just blow up these cropped photos in an editor you can end up with fuzzy or pixelated results. We knew we could do better.<br /><br />OK, so the magic part: Neural Macro. On iPhones with a Neural Engine (iPhone 8 and later), we use a neural network to intelligently upscale images. You get sharp, clean contours at 2x and even 3x the scale! To turn this on, just tap the “2x” button while in Macro Mode.<br /><br />If you later change your mind about the crop, have no fear. Halide saves the full, uncropped version of your photo in your library. And of course, we’d never touch your RAW files: RAW files are saved unprocessed and uncropped.<br /><br />Macro Mode is available to all Halide users, regardless of iPhone, and we can’t wait to see your shots! Please share them with us on social media by tagging your shots #ShotWithHalide so we can share them!<br /><br />Now for some birthday news: Halide Mark II is now almost a year old — making Halide almost four and a half years! That also means that if you got Halide Mark II for free last year, this is the last month you will be receiving new features. We’ve worked hard for the last four and a half years to bring you new features for free. If you’d like to keep receiving these major new features, check out the renewal options inside Settings. If you prefer to keep using Halide Mark II — with Macro Mode — the app will, of course, keep working with all its current features.<br /><br />Thank you for all your support and feedback. Without your continued support, we couldn’t do what we love most: to work on this camera app and see the amazing photos our users take all over the world.<br /><br />If you have any feedback or bug reports, let us know at support@lux.camera. If you like what we’re doing, please consider leaving a review, as they go a long way. And don’t forget to tag your photos #shotwithhalide for a chance to be featured on our Twitter and Instagram!<br /><br />— Team Halide</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’m new to IPhone photography and I have an IPhone XR “yes I know the 12 is out “ but that’s not an option for me right now lol.   I poured over review after review on which camera app was best for me as a beginner and was instantly drawn to Halide even though I was Nervous I wouldn’t understand how to use it. I went back-and-forth for about a week and all of a sudden the mark two announcement was made. I took that as a sign since Halide had already been out for a bit. With only a couple days using the app I have to say I feel like it’s one of the best decisions I’ve made on the App Store. The ability have the raw, JPEG and the mixed image is amazing Because it gives beginners the ability to actually see the difference side-by-side. The UI is very clean elegant and calm and very much appreciated by a noob like myself. I’m still in my Trial period but my photos look amazing and I cannot stop taking pictures lol. Super excited to edit some of my raw photos this evening. To all my newbies out there who may be in a position like I was where you want the best quality but you also need it to be cost effective and future proof you will not regret Halide .  Ben, Sebastiaan,Rebecca,<br />Thank you for a beautiful product and Cheers to you all.</p>

    From Premium to Subscription

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I&#39;m so very fed up and very, very tired of greedy and unethical developers like these two. Who make all they can from selling an app as a premium, one-time purchase. Then they succumb to greed and avarice and change their initially premium app into another filthy subscription. It&#39;s truly unethical, immoral and abhorrent behavior and very fitting of the lowest of the low crooks. This type of scummy and low rent behavior is sadly quite commonplace now among App Store developers.<br /><br />Then they offer a new one-time purchase of $35 dollars! Gee, how very generous, thank you so very much... I already paid for this app as a premium program. But, sure, let me give you even more money or pay you forever via the subscription plan for an app I already owned and paid good money for, just so I can continue to receive updates. Developers like you two make the App Store such an unpleasant and shady place to do business. <br /><br />I don&#39;t care for your dishonest remarks about why you pulled such a massive bait-and-switch by changing this app from premium to another disgusting subscription plan. Because it&#39;s simply just lies and is just saying the exact same tired, pathetic line as all the other crooked developers and businesses that pull this underhanded scam on their once trusting and once loyal customers. You should be ashamed of your seriously unethical and immoral actions. I wouldn&#39;t give you the lint in my pockets now. I hope you two enjoy all your ill gotten gains.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Joshua, we&#39;re sorry if there was any confusion, but if you already purchased Halide there is nothing new you need to purchase. Halide will continue to work for you. However, it&#39;s economically impossible to work on something forever after receiving a one-time payment. We don&#39;t put any sort of advertisements in the app, so this is the only way we make money. After three years free updates, we decided to embark on a massive, 18-month long project that became Halide Mark II. Most developers in our situation would abandon the old version of their app, and ask everyone to buy the next version. Instead we decided to not only give users our new app, but also an additional year of huge free updates. After one year, you don&#39;t have to pay anything. You can just keep using Halide. But if you&#39;re happy with Halide Mark II, and wish to receive additional updates, you can make a one time purchase. Or not. Halide will continue to work, as it always has, without an additional payment.</p>

have a few fixes for you fine folks. This update addresses...\n \n* A potential crash on iOS 15.1 that can occur when granting limited access to your photo library\n* A potential crash on older devices when capturing in Macro Mode with 3x magnification\n* An issue where you get prompted for camera permissions the moment you launch the app for the first time\n* A few updated translations\n \nOur next big update is going well, and we can't wait to get it into your hands. In the mean time, we'd love to keep hearing your feedback! Just email support@lux.camera.\n\n---\n\nHALIDE 2.5: A BIG DAY FOR SMALL THINGS\n\nDid you know? The latest iPhone 13 Pro takes amazing Macro shots. That got us pretty excited. But we also wanted *everyone* to be excited about taking great Macro photos.\n\nSo we created Macro Mode.\n\nHalide now offers the best tool for close-up photos on any iPhone, and the perfect companion for the iPhone 13 Pro’s new near-focusing camera: Macro Mode!\n\nMacro Mode is helped by our new technology called Neural Macro. Halide’s Macro Mode does a few clever things to help you get the best Macro shot: first, it checks which one of your cameras can focus the closest. Then, it gives you ultra-precise focus control to get your teeny-tiny subject perfectly sharp. Finally, once taken, Neural Macro gets to work: a powerful AI-based detail enhancement process gets even more detail out of your processed image.\n\nTo turn on Macro Mode, first tap the AF button to get into manual focus, and then tap the flower button. When activated, Halide switches to the lens on your phone with the closest focus distance. It also increases the size of the focus dial, allowing granular adustments down to the millimeter.\n\nShooting with the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro lens, you’ll often find yourself cropping images due to its ultra-wide field of field. There’s just one problem: if you just blow up these cropped photos in an editor you can end up with fuzzy or pixelated results. We knew we could do better.\n\nOK, so the magic part: Neural Macro. On iPhones with a Neural Engine (iPhone 8 and later), we use a neural network to intelligently upscale images. You get sharp, clean contours at 2x and even 3x the scale! To turn this on, just tap the “2x” button while in Macro Mode.\n\nIf you later change your mind about the crop, have no fear. Halide saves the full, uncropped version of your photo in your library. And of course, we’d never touch your RAW files: RAW files are saved unprocessed and uncropped.\n\nMacro Mode is available to all Halide users, regardless of iPhone, and we can’t wait to see your shots! Please share them with us on social media by tagging your shots #ShotWithHalide so we can share them!\n\nNow for some birthday news: Halide Mark II is now almost a year old — making Halide almost four and a half years! That also means that if you got Halide Mark II for free last year, this is the last month you will be receiving new features. We’ve worked hard for the last four and a half years to bring you new features for free. If you’d like to keep receiving these major new features, check out the renewal options inside Settings. If you prefer to keep using Halide Mark II — with Macro Mode — the app will, of course, keep working with all its current features.\n\nThank you for all your support and feedback. Without your continued support, we couldn’t do what we love most: to work on this camera app and see the amazing photos our users take all over the world.\n\nIf you have any feedback or bug reports, let us know at support@lux.camera. If you like what we’re doing, please consider leaving a review, as they go a long way. And don’t forget to tag your photos #shotwithhalide for a chance to be featured on our Twitter and Instagram!\n\n— Team Halide","releaseDate":"2021-11-10"},{"versionDisplay":"2.5.3","releaseNotes":"This is a small update to our big Macro Mode update!

Finally, once taken, Neural Macro gets to work: a powerful AI-based detail enhancement process gets even more detail out of your processed image.\n\nTo turn on Macro Mode, first tap the AF button to get into manual focus, and then tap the flower button. When activated, Halide switches to the lens on your phone with the closest focus distance. It also increases the size of the focus dial, allowing granular adustments down to the millimeter.\n\nShooting with the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro lens, you’ll often find yourself cropping images due to its ultra-wide field of field. There’s just one problem: if you just blow up these cropped photos in an editor you can end up with fuzzy or pixelated results. We knew we could do better.\n\nOK, so the magic part: Neural Macro. On iPhones with a Neural Engine (iPhone 8 and later), we use a neural network to intelligently upscale images. You get sharp, clean contours at 2x and even 3x the scale! To turn this on, just tap the “2x” button while in Macro Mode.\n\nIf you later change your mind about the crop, have no fear. Halide saves the full, uncropped version of your photo in your library. And of course, we’d never touch your RAW files: RAW files are saved unprocessed and uncropped.\n\nMacro Mode is available to all Halide users, regardless of iPhone, and we can’t wait to see your shots! Please share them with us on social media by tagging your shots #ShotWithHalide so we can share them!\n\nNow for some birthday news: Halide Mark II is now almost a year old — making Halide almost four and a half years! That also means that if you got Halide Mark II for free last year, this is the last month you will be receiving new features.

This doesn’t sound like a big deal, but due to some bugs in iOS 15, photos in third-party camera apps were not always saved. Halide tries to save photos that cannot be saved to its ‘Image Rescue’ feature in the gallery, but we now also automatically re-try saving photos when a new error in iOS occurs. This should result in fewer errors when shooting on your brand-new iPhone.\n* Additional enhancements and fixes to run this excellent lil camera as good as possible on your latest shiny iPhone — as well as all the other iPhones.\n \nIf you previously had issues with Halide showing errors when taking photos, please let us know via support or social media if this update fixes it.

Really big. \n\nBigger than any iPhone…\n\nMeet Halide for iPad! \n\nWhen we set out to build the the best camera for iPad, we knew we had to do it right. Halide for iPad is much more than the best iPhone pro camera app on a bigger screen— we’ve rethought Halide from the ground-up to take full advantage of the new form factor.\n\nBecause the iPad is a two-handed device, we’ve placed critical controls on the left and right edges, so you can tap with your thumbs without losing your grip. The new Honeycomb interface gives you controls right next to the shutter button — every powerful feature of Halide is just as easy to reach as they are on the iPhone. \n\nIn fully manual mode, the ISO and Shutter Speed dials sit on opposite ends, and you can even control both dials simultaneously.\n\nWe found when placing buttons on one side of an iPad, the UI was suddenly biased toward left or right handed people. To solve this, we’re excited to say Halide is first ambidextrous camera for iPad! You can toggle your hand-preference in “Advanced Settings,” or by long pressing the Settings icon in the Honeycomb. Southpaws, rejoice.\n\nThat’s just the beginning of our beautiful new iPad interface. Massive full-size photo review, with metadata? Check. Instant RAW on the big screen? Yep. Effortless depth modes and lens switchers under your second hand? It’s all there. \n\niPad includes unique features, designed for its large screen and unique qualities. You might have felt that composing shots on a giant screen is a bit… odd. Very often you’ll look at the photo later, on an iPhone or at a smaller size, only to have it “read” differently. Not to mention, due to the similar shape of the iPad and its camera sensor, any camera app often puts its controls right on top of the image you’re trying to compose. \n\nThat’s why Halide on iPad has a feature called Pro View. Tap the shrinking icon in the bottom left, and the viewfinder instantly scales down to a smaller size to judge composition. This gives full breathing room for Halide’s powerful pro tools like the color waveform and histogram, manual focus or even manual shutter and ISO controls. None of the interface now covers your image, and you can preview your composition at a smaller size. We quickly found that this can be a near essential tool for photography on iPad.\n\nWe have a ton of great new features, but there’s a limit on what we can fit into release notes. We hope you enjoy discovering all the little touches that went into this update. Maybe there’s even a new icon in there? Oops, we said too much.

Other formats, like native RAW and JPEG, will benefit from these speedups as well.\n\nFor users on devices that use Haptic Touch (iPhone 11 and later), you can now access a context menu on the Last Photo image in the lower left. Just long-press the small preview image to view a larger preview, quickly favorite or delete your last photo, or open it in a supported editor. Older devices can accesss this context menu through 3D Touch (RIP), where supported.\n\nThank you for sending in feedback and issues: we’ve worked hard to fix some of your reports. Finally, we’ve eliminated our top crashes, and upgraded some hidden machinery. We’ve got some really cool stuff coming up, so we’re getting things in order. \n\nAs a reminder, Halide Mark II is a free update for all our existing Halide 1 users. If you loved the update, please consider getting a Membership to support us in the Settings. As a reward, you will unlock some special icons.\n\nWe're listening to feedback and bug reports, so if you have any requests, please reach out to support@lux.camera and we'll get right on it. You can also reach out to @halidecamera on Twitter. We're a small, three person team, but we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nFinally: if you enjoy Halide Mark II, please consider leaving a rating. It helps us a lot!\n\n- Ben, Sebastiaan, and

I went back-and-forth for about a week and all of a sudden the mark two announcement was made. I took that as a sign since Halide had already been out for a bit. With only a couple days using the app I have to say I feel like it’s one of the best decisions I’ve made on the App Store. The ability have the raw, JPEG and the mixed image is amazing Because it gives beginners the ability to actually see the difference side-by-side. The UI is very clean elegant and calm and very much appreciated by a noob like myself. I’m still in my Trial period but my photos look amazing and I cannot stop taking pictures lol. Super excited to edit some of my raw photos this evening.

Halide will continue to work for you. However, it's economically impossible to work on something forever after receiving a one-time payment. We don't put any sort of advertisements in the app, so this is the only way we make money. After three years free updates, we decided to embark on a massive, 18-month long project that became Halide Mark II. Most developers in our situation would abandon the old version of their app, and ask everyone to buy the next version. Instead we decided to not only give users our new app, but also an additional year of huge free updates. After one year, you don't have to pay anything. You can just keep using Halide. But if you're happy with Halide Mark II, and wish to receive additional updates, you can make a one time purchase. Or not.

This type of scummy and low rent behavior is sadly quite commonplace now among App Store developers.\n\nThen they offer a new one-time purchase of $35 dollars! Gee, how very generous, thank you so very much... I already paid for this app as a premium program. But, sure, let me give you even more money or pay you forever via the subscription plan for an app I already owned and paid good money for, just so I can continue to receive updates. Developers like you two make the App Store such an unpleasant and shady place to do business. \n\nI don't care for your dishonest remarks about why you pulled such a massive bait-and-switch by changing this app from premium to another disgusting subscription plan.

As someone who purchased the app early I still get to enjoy the features of this new app for no extra charge!!!! Most devs try and force you into buying the new app because they drop support for the old on, not these Devs. Updates until Dec 21 is fair. \n\nThe functionality and ease of shooting has allowed me to take some breath taking shots, I have even started making picture books for my friends. I love the tutorials within the app, would be cool to have a section were you offer classes on how to shot with a mobile camera, It would make the subscription model more appealing to those who may not want to go pay more than the original cost and help to bring in Mobile users who may feel intimidated by all the features or just want to learn mobile photography, you could even offer a subscription for the classes alone if advertised correctly(worked in sales for a few years now, I know how to sell a product especially one this cool). \n\nAnyway 5 stars!!!!

I want to thank you for using our app for so long - it's great to know that people download our app, and even more so 1.5 years! \n\nHalide turns three next month. In that time, we've updated the app constantly and added new features at no charge to users. We're proud of that, and we hope that shows how committed we are to you as our longtime loyal app user. \n\nI'll talk about a few things in your review, but want to tackle that last one first: update frequency. It's true that in early 2020, we had fewer updates: this has to do with doing big work on new features that we couldn't fit in tiny patches. We update Halide regularly, but were also working with Apple on two major issues: depth mode crashes (a memory usage and API level issue) and photos being lost for a small sub-percentage of users. We introduced an update to fix these issues recently, and you can contact me personally if you want to let me know if that fixed your issues: I read all support emails! \n\nI want to ensure you we are spending all of our time on researching cool new features and fixing issues in the app. Every day I get up to work on new Halide ideas and features, as well as the sister app, Spectre. Me and Ben work on this full-time, and you can read on our blog at blog.halide.cam to see what kind of research we do - the latest being a deep dive into iPad LIDAR technology. \n\nHalide is three, but we're just getting started. I hope you're happy with our latest glut of updates -- there's been three in just a few weeks! And if you have any ideas or concerns, reach out to me.

It was probably my favorite camera go to app. It really used to feel like the company was thriving on a great idea that had never been seen on an iPhone before and they took the time to fine tune it. A lot has changed and here is its current state. It has now turned into a very hit or miss application. The app crashes from taking a depth photo and from that, the photo taken is never saved. Most of the features will crash the app as well. Even switching from different camera lenses will crash the thing. I feel like the company has realized they are at a loss for innovation. They are no longer spending resources on R\u0026D let alone basic maintenance hours. I’m sure we will start to notice less and less updates, until it eventually gets lost among the rest. Please do not waste your money. Wait for them to prove me wrong and make the necessary bug fixes. FYI, A typical active company has two week sprints. At the end of each sprint, an update is pushed to insure continued application maintenance. Feature releases take a lot longer and are usually multiple sprints but bug fixes are not.","title":"Do not pay for this application until you read this","userName":"JohnnyIsland"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3843386669","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-03-05T00:23:21Z","rating":5,"review":"I’m a designer and DSLR photographer, so the camera features on my phone is a big deal to me. When I upgraded from a 6, I was torn between the XS and XR. I’d been gravitating toward the XR due to the colors, battery life, price, and better lowlight photos, but was devastated it only had portrait mode for people. I heard about Halide finding a solution to this problem, so I went with the XR and bought this app. I took a photo of my dog and I’m in love with its ability to pretty accurately map out data for bokeh shots. My photo went straight to the default apple photos app, and reads it as a portrait photo now so I can adjust the blur like I can on people portraits. The only setback is not seeing bokeh in live mode, but it’s no biggie and who knows what exciting features future updates will bring. \n\nThank you Ben \u0026 Sebastiaan for using your intelligence, skills, and talent to make a camera like this for the iPhone XR.

There are however a few bugs with the app one of them being landscape mode. Yes it orients the photo correctly but the UI does not shift. I’m sure this will be and can be fixed in a future update.

It’s designed around two principles: the kind of granular settings you’d expect from a professional DSLR; and a slick, one-handed interface that complements today’s devices.","short":"Take a photo in manual mode.","tagline":"Dial up the depth and detail"},"hasInAppPurchases":true,"hasMessagesExtension":false,"isAppleWatchSupported":true,"isGameCenterEnabled":false,"isHiddenFromSpringboard":false,"isSiriSupported":false,"releaseDate":"2017-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","requiresGameController":false,"subtitle":"Pro RAW \u0026 Manual Camera","supportsGameController":false,"supportsPassbook":false,"copyright":"© 2021 Lux Optics Inc","description":{"standard":"**Please note Halide is not free.

You can also buy the app outright with a single in-app purchase.** \n\nHalide is an App Store Editor's Choice, award-winning camera from the team behind Spectre, Apple's App of the Year of 2019. Its multitude of awards include iMore's \"App of the Year 2020,\" Macworld's \"Must Have Apps,\" The Verge's \"Apps We Love,\" and The Sweet Setup's \"Best Third-Party Camera App for iPhone.\"\n\nHalide is the most powerful camera for iPhone with the most elegant, simple design — A pro camera for everyone.\n\nThis is a groundbreaking app for deliberate and thoughtful photography. With high-end tools, and a beautiful interface designed from scratch for the latest iPhones and inspired by the controls of professional cameras, Halide is your go-to camera when you want to really take a photo rather than a quick snapshot.\n\nUse gestures in Halide to change exposure and manual focus with a swipe, or switch from its powerful automatic mode to manual shooting. Halide’s professional tools are the most powerful in the App Store, with XDR (Extended Dynamic Range) 14-bit RAW streaming waveform views, color zebras, focus assists like focus peaking and loupe, histograms, an adaptive level grid, and manual depth capture. Customize controls to adapt the app to your needs.\n\nHalide’s ProRAW support* is unmatched. Strike the right balance between file size and editing latitude by choosing between 12-bit and 10-bit ProRAW, with or without JPEG sidecars. Effortlessly switch to native RAW, for greater detail and speed.\n\nFeatures:\n- Beautiful, intuitive gesture-based interface, usable with one hand\n- Take portraits of pets and objects on iPhone XR and iPhone SE\n- Manual focus, and powerful tools like a Focus Loupe and Focus Peaking\n- Smart automatic mode with Halide Smart RAW, optimizing settings with Machine Learning for RAW files with less noise and more detail\n- Full manual exposure controls including shutter speed, ISO and white balance\n- Best-on-iPhone exposure tools: histograms, XDR 14-bit RGB waveform, and color zebra stripes\n- Captures RAW, TIFF, HEIC or JPG for the best quality shots\n- Grid overlay with built-in level\n- A powerful reviewer to view DNG, JPG, HEIC and Live Photos, as well as Portrait depth data and mattes, with a detailed metadata view\n- Instant RAW development process to quickly develop your RAW files in a tap\n- Technical Readout to view all details of your iPhone camera hardware\n- Apple Watch companion app for remote shooting\n- Siri Shortcuts support to trigger the shutter remotely, or open Halide in Auto or Manual mode\n- Coverage, a powerful new feature to take two photos with a small delay to capture both a maximum-Smart HDR processed image with Deep Fusion and Smart HDR, as well as a DNG RAW.\n- Become a better photographer by signing up for comprehensive lessons like a 10-day quick tutorial right from the app.\n- Private by Design: Halide does not include any trackers or tracking, has not third party libraries, does not collect data or photos, and never transmits any information. Halide also includes features to reduce spying by companies like Facebook by limiting location information on photos shared from the app.\n- Feature limitations:\n\n*ProRAW requires iPhone 12 Pro or Pro Max or iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max\nThe Ultra Wide and selfie cameras do not support RAW or manual focus unless on iOS 15.\nWaveform requires iPhone 8 or later.

The latest iPhone 13 Pro takes amazing Macro shots. That got us pretty excited. But we also wanted *everyone* to be excited about taking great Macro photos.\n\nSo we created Macro Mode.\n\nHalide now offers the best tool for close-up photos on any iPhone, and the perfect companion for the iPhone 13 Pro’s new near-focusing camera: Macro Mode!\n\nMacro Mode is helped by our new technology called Neural Macro. Halide’s Macro Mode does a few clever things to help you get the best Macro shot: first, it checks which one of your cameras can focus the closest. Then, it gives you ultra-precise focus control to get your teeny-tiny subject perfectly sharp. Finally, once taken, Neural Macro gets to work: a powerful AI-based detail enhancement process gets even more detail out of your processed image.\n\nTo turn on Macro Mode, first tap the AF button to get into manual focus, and then tap the flower button. When activated, Halide switches to the lens on your phone with the closest focus distance. It also increases the size of the focus dial, allowing granular adustments down to the millimeter.\n\nShooting with the iPhone 13 Pro’s macro lens, you’ll often find yourself cropping images due to its ultra-wide field of field. There’s just one problem: if you just blow up these cropped photos in an editor you can end up with fuzzy or pixelated results. We knew we could do better.\n\nOK, so the magic part: Neural Macro. On iPhones with a Neural Engine (iPhone 8 and later), we use a neural network to intelligently upscale images. You get sharp, clean contours at 2x and even 3x the scale! To turn this on, just tap the “2x” button while in Macro Mode.\n\nIf you later change your mind about the crop, have no fear. Halide saves the full, uncropped version of your photo in your library. And of course, we’d never touch your RAW files: RAW files are saved unprocessed and uncropped.\n\nMacro Mode is available to all Halide users, regardless of iPhone, and we can’t wait to see your shots! Please share them with us on social media by tagging your shots #ShotWithHalide so we can share them!\n\nNow for some birthday news: Halide Mark II is now almost a year old — making Halide almost four and a half years! That also means that if you got Halide Mark II for free last year, this is the last month you will be receiving new features. We’ve worked hard for the last four and a half years to bring you new features for free. If you’d like to keep receiving these major new features, check out the renewal options inside Settings. If you prefer to keep using Halide Mark II — with Macro Mode — the app will, of course, keep working with all its current features.\n\nThank you for all your support and feedback. Without your continued support, we couldn’t do what we love most: to work on this camera app and see the amazing photos our users take all over the world.\n\nIf you have any feedback or bug reports, let us know at support@lux.camera.

This doesn’t sound like a big deal, but due to some bugs in iOS 15, photos in third-party camera apps were not always saved. Halide tries to save photos that cannot be saved to its ‘Image Rescue’ feature in the gallery, but we now also automatically re-try saving photos when a new error in iOS occurs. This should result in fewer errors when shooting on your brand-new iPhone.\n* Additional enhancements and fixes to run this excellent lil camera as good as possible on your latest shiny iPhone — as well as all the other iPhones.\n \nIf you previously had issues with Halide showing errors when taking photos, please let us know via support or social media if this update fixes it.

Really big. \n\nBigger than any iPhone…\n\nMeet Halide for iPad! \n\nWhen we set out to build the the best camera for iPad, we knew we had to do it right. Halide for iPad is much more than the best iPhone pro camera app on a bigger screen— we’ve rethought Halide from the ground-up to take full advantage of the new form factor.\n\nBecause the iPad is a two-handed device, we’ve placed critical controls on the left and right edges, so you can tap with your thumbs without losing your grip. The new Honeycomb interface gives you controls right next to the shutter button — every powerful feature of Halide is just as easy to reach as they are on the iPhone. \n\nIn fully manual mode, the ISO and Shutter Speed dials sit on opposite ends, and you can even control both dials simultaneously.\n\nWe found when placing buttons on one side of an iPad, the UI was suddenly biased toward left or right handed people. To solve this, we’re excited to say Halide is first ambidextrous camera for iPad! You can toggle your hand-preference in “Advanced Settings,” or by long pressing the Settings icon in the Honeycomb. Southpaws, rejoice.\n\nThat’s just the beginning of our beautiful new iPad interface. Massive full-size photo review, with metadata? Check. Instant RAW on the big screen? Yep. Effortless depth modes and lens switchers under your second hand? It’s all there. \n\niPad includes unique features, designed for its large screen and unique qualities. You might have felt that composing shots on a giant screen is a bit… odd. Very often you’ll look at the photo later, on an iPhone or at a smaller size, only to have it “read” differently. Not to mention, due to the similar shape of the iPad and its camera sensor, any camera app often puts its controls right on top of the image you’re trying to compose. \n\nThat’s why Halide on iPad has a feature called Pro View. Tap the shrinking icon in the bottom left, and the viewfinder instantly scales down to a smaller size to judge composition. This gives full breathing room for Halide’s powerful pro tools like the color waveform and histogram, manual focus or even manual shutter and ISO controls. None of the interface now covers your image, and you can preview your composition at a smaller size. We quickly found that this can be a near essential tool for photography on iPad.\n\nWe have a ton of great new features, but there’s a limit on what we can fit into release notes. We hope you enjoy discovering all the little touches that went into this update. Maybe there’s even a new icon in there? Oops, we said too much. We can’t wait for you to discover all we packed into this update. \n\nIf you have any feedback or bug reports, you can always email us at support@lux.camera.

Tap the shrinking icon in the bottom left, and the viewfinder instantly scales down to a smaller size to judge composition. This gives full breathing room for Halide’s powerful pro tools like the color waveform and histogram, manual focus or even manual shutter and ISO controls. None of the interface now covers your image, and you can preview your composition at a smaller size. We quickly found that this can be a near essential tool for photography on iPad.\n\nWe have a ton of great new features, but there’s a limit on what we can fit into release notes. We hope you enjoy discovering all the little touches that went into this update. Maybe there’s even a new icon in there? Oops, we said too much. We can’t wait for you to discover all we packed into this update. \n\nIf you have any feedback or bug reports, you can always email us at support@lux.camera. If you enjoy this update, consider leaving a review, as they go a long way. Finally, we’d love to see what you do with your iPad (or iPhone!). Tag your photos #ShotWithHalide and #ShotOniPad for a chance to be featured! \n\nBut one warning: if we catch you shooting any concert photos on an iPad, you’re blocked.\n\nThank you for supporting Halide, and we hope you enjoy this update.\n\n— The Lux Team (Rebecca, Jaimi, Jackson, Ben, and Sebastiaan)","releaseDate":"2021-05-18"},{"versionDisplay":"2.1.10","releaseNotes":"This small update fixes an issue where EXIF data would not be written to some photos, causing them to display incorrectly.","releaseDate":"2021-04-05"},{"versionDisplay":"2.1.9","releaseNotes":"In this small update, we think we've put an end to the very rare “XPC” and “Helper Application\" error alerts that pop up when capturing a photo.

This new build enhances and improves many small things.\n\nIn prior versions of iOS, we found issues when capturing with both RAW+HEIC, so we disabled it rather than risk losing photos. After testing iOS 14.4, we've found the format combination stable enough that it's ready for prime time, so you can now shoot RAW+HEIC!\n\nIf you've grown fond of RAW+JPEG for compatability reasons, you can revert to the old behavior: open Halide's Settings, tap \"Advanced”, and pick the \"Most Compatible\" option.\n\nInside the Membership screen in Settings, new users on the free trial will now see a better countdown of the days remaining.\n\nOn the international front, we've fixed a few buttons that look weird when localized in longer languages like Dutch and German.\n\nFinally, while Halide has always been 99% crash free, we continue to strive for the impossible 100%. We've hunted down three elusive crash types.\n\nWe're always listening to your feedback, so feel free to drop us a line support@lux.camera with your feedback or bug reports.

This update bundles a bunch of tiny improvements.\n\nIf you've been seeing a blank membership screen, this was caused by an unusual combination of in-app purchases; when our member screen gets confused, we display a blank screen rather than crash the app. This is now fixed, so get in there and try on some new icons!\n\nWe have two improvements around color. To begin with, we now render ProRAW files in beautiful wide-color on iOS 14.4. Take in those greener-greens and luscious reds. This wouldn't be possible without the help of graphics engineers at Apple, so thanks!\n\nWe've also fixed an opposite problem: while using Focus Peaking and Zebras, certain colors were a little too saturated. We found a bug in our color transformations, so now things will look more true-to-life.\n\nWe fixed a bug where Instant RAW settings weren't respected while exporting a ProRAW file as a JPEG. Now what you see in our gallery view is exactly what you'll get when you export that JPEG.\n\nFinally, we've localized more text and fixed a typo here and there.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to support@lux.camera.
