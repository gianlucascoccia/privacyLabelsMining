        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I downloaded this app specifically for the round up rule. I connected my bank account and waited for funds to start being added when I made purchases, but nothing happened. I sent multiple emails asking for help as it was not working and nothing was being deposited in my kids goal accounts. After several weeks and MULTIPLE emails I sent one last email asking them to cancel my account and threatened to contact the BBB. I finally received a response stating my email must have been “lost in a black hole” and they canceled my account as requested. I find this so frustrating as I had sent so many emails and all I wanted was help fixing an issue. I would have been a long time customer had someone helped me. Very disappointed! I’ll be using stash from now on!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I am changing my review as the CEO has reached out to me and rectified the situation. She reached out by email and even provided me with her personal cell phone number. She apologized and even gave my kids a free goalcard for my troubles. I am now giving the app another try and so far so good. I really do think this app is a fantastic way to save for your children which is why I did not hesitate to give it another try once my issues had been resolved. Thank you goalsetter for reaching out to me, it is appreciated more than you!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi Apruiett...I&#39;m so sorry that you had this experience with us.  We had a few weeks of significant growth that were unexpected, and the result was that we disappointed you and let you down.   And as a result, we let your kids d own, because the whole reason we exist is to make saving easy and fun for kids.  As the founder and CEO of Goalsetter, I take personal responsibility for this disappointment, and would love to ask you for a second chance to prove that we can, and will, do better.  Whether you decide to give us one - or just want to vent - you can contact me directly at tanya@goalsetter.co, and I&#39;ll listen and respond to your concerns immediately.  I&#39;ll even get on a call with you and take your feedback - or tongue-lashing - directly, because it&#39;s how we will grow and evolve.  I apologize, again, and want you to know that we&#39;re fixing this problem, and that&#39;s because you made us pay attention to it.  Thank you for doing so.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>While I was raised by two fabulous parents, fiscal responsibility wasn’t necessarily prioritized. Perhaps it was because there wasn’t that much money to begin with! While I learned the hard way how to manage money, I still dropped the ball when it came to teaching my children the lessons I learned the hard way. That’s why I absolutely love the Goalsetter app! It’s really helped me engage with my kids about money. It sparks conversations about what they’re doing with their money and why. I recently ordered the Cashola card for my 14-year-old son, and it’s been amazing. He’s really cognizant of his spending, and we really love the regular “lit quizzes” that he takes to enable the use of his cards We do the questions (which are great!) together and have a good time. I think I’d been so lax about teaching my kids about spending and saving because I didn’t have a blueprint or guide, but Goalsetter has served that purpose. And while this has been about my kids, the app is helping me better shape my own financial goals and rethink some of the fiscal decisions I’ve made. We are becoming much more intentional about money as family and this app – and the Cashola card – has help immensely. I highly recommend this!!!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I opened up a Goalsetter account for my granddaughter a few months ago. I have been so happy with the results. I like the flexibility of having money transfer over easily and feel the whole premise of Goalsetter is to educate young people. Honestly this information is nothing that I would’ve learned as a young child. I love the fact that there is an age-appropriate quiz every week. My granddaughter is five and when we’re together she tells me not to forget that we have to do her quiz for the week. She is excited to learn new money ideas. Most kids love toys. The app gives them the idea that if they get an amount of money for a gift, maybe they should put half in the bank. Now I’m told I know we can’t get a toy every time we’re together, because I need to save some money too. I’m so happy I found Goalsetter. It is never too young to make smart decisions. It is much easier later than to make informed decisions. For the kids it’s done in a way that’s fun also. Thanks again, Goalsetter.</p>

As the founder and CEO of Goalsetter, I take personal responsibility for this disappointment, and would love to ask you for a second chance to prove that we can, and will, do better.  Whether you decide to give us one - or just want to vent - you can contact me directly at tanya@goalsetter.co, and I'll listen and respond to your concerns immediately.  I'll even get on a call with you and take your feedback - or tongue-lashing - directly, because it's how we will grow and evolve.

I connected my bank account and waited for funds to start being added when I made purchases, but nothing happened. I sent multiple emails asking for help as it was not working and nothing was being deposited in my kids goal accounts. After several weeks and MULTIPLE emails I sent one last email asking them to cancel my account and threatened to contact the BBB. I finally received a response stating my email must have been “lost in a black hole” and they canceled my account as requested. I find this so frustrating as I had sent so many emails and all I wanted was help fixing an issue. I would have been a long time customer had someone helped me. Very disappointed! I’ll be using stash from now on!\n\nUPDATE:\nI am changing my review as the CEO has reached out to me and rectified the situation. She reached out by email and even provided me with her personal cell phone number. She apologized and even gave my kids a free goalcard for my troubles. I am now giving the app another try and so far so good.

Perhaps it was because there wasn’t that much money to begin with! While I learned the hard way how to manage money, I still dropped the ball when it came to teaching my children the lessons I learned the hard way. That’s why I absolutely love the Goalsetter app! It’s really helped me engage with my kids about money. It sparks conversations about what they’re doing with their money and why. I recently ordered the Cashola card for my 14-year-old son, and it’s been amazing. He’s really cognizant of his spending, and we really love the regular “lit quizzes” that he takes to enable the use of his cards We do the questions (which are great!) together and have a good time. I think I’d been so lax about teaching my kids about spending and saving because I didn’t have a blueprint or guide, but Goalsetter has served that purpose. And while this has been about my kids, the app is helping me better shape my own financial goals and rethink some of the fiscal decisions I’ve made. We are becoming much more intentional about money as family and this app – and the Cashola card – has help immensely. I highly recommend this!!!","title":"Highly recommend!

I have been so happy with the results. I like the flexibility of having money transfer over easily and feel the whole premise of Goalsetter is to educate young people. Honestly this information is nothing that I would’ve learned as a young child. I love the fact that there is an age-appropriate quiz every week. My granddaughter is five and when we’re together she tells me not to forget that we have to do her quiz for the week. She is excited to learn new money ideas. Most kids love toys. The app gives them the idea that if they get an amount of money for a gift, maybe they should put half in the bank. Now I’m told I know we can’t get a toy every time we’re together, because I need to save some money too. I’m so happy I found Goalsetter. It is never too young to make smart decisions. It is much easier later than to make informed decisions. For the kids it’s done in a way that’s fun also.

Downside you have to deposit money into the account/accounts before they’ll even allow you to order the debit card/cards. Then the debit card/cards take forever to get delivered. Nowhere do they tell you have to deposit money then order the card. Then entire reason I decided to do this is because my son was going on vacation and I wanted to give him money and be able to give him more if he needed it but the card is so late coming that my son left before it even arrived. Don’t even know if I’ll keep the app now. I signed up with Verizon family share. It’s through Verizon so I know it’s secure and safe.
