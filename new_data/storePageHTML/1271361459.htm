With Flow, everyone can create sketches, lists, storyboards, designs, handwritten notes, floor plans, recipes, diagrams, journals and works of art.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Welcome to Flow 2.5 – this is a huge update with exciting new features and enhancements to the existing things you already love.<br /><br /><br />SHAREPLAY<br /><br />Flow has pioneered collaboration in a drawing app and with SharePlay, you can now automatically share a Flow document while on FaceTime. Strokes appear in realtime so it’s just like sharing a piece of paper, wherever you are.<br /><br />To use SharePlay, ensure all devices have been updated to iOS 15.1 or above and when on FaceTime just open Flow and follow the prompts.  If other participants do not have a Flow membership, they will still be able to collaborate with you whilst on the call.<br /><br />Special mention to our tireless Adam D who has spent many hours on FaceTime calls with himself whilst in the testing phase of the SharePlay feature.  Adam1, please remember Adam2 is probably not real but we hope you created some wonderful art together.<br /><br /><br />PEN SETS<br /><br />Pen Sets is a huge new feature we are really excited to get in your hands. It’s a simple and powerful new way to use pens in Flow that will improve how you work and create. Instead of a single dock of pens, you can now create multiple sets of pens and quickly swap between them.<br /><br />For example you can now curate a set of pens for taking notes, and another set for colored pencil sketching, and swap between them with either a gesture or the new Pen Sets button on the Pen Dock. You can create multiple set of pens with a range of colors for easy access. <br /><br />Flow will remember which of your Pen Sets you were using for each document and automatically switch to the last set you were using as you move between documents.  <br /><br />On the Pen Sets screen you can swipe between all your Pen Sets, create new ones and edit them. When editing you can add a name for the Pen Set and re-arrange the pens within it. You can tap on each pen to edit it individually. You can also delete, duplicate and drag pens between your sets.<br /><br />You can even share Pen Sets with other people by sending them a special link. Sharing is caring right? <br /><br /><br />NEW EYEDROPPER<br /><br />We’ve improved both the eyedropper and quick color grid tools. In fact they’ve merged (Voltron style) into a more powerful tool than you can possibly imagine. The new eyedropper icon on the Tool Editor replaces what was previously the Quick Color Grid button. Press and hold on it to instantly activate the eyedropper.  <br /><br />When the eyedropper is active, the Tool Editor changes to display a redesigned color grid with a range of shade and tint variations on the current color. You can drag over these to select one, or drag over the canvas or pens to pick a new color. The eyedropper itself now displays as a ring, with one half showing your existing color for comparison.<br /><br />IMESSAGE STICKER APP<br /><br />Draw your own custom set of iMessage stickers from Flow. When you save selections from your documents into the pasteboard, they automatically become available in the new Flow iMessage app.  Your stickers are synced between devices so you can create them on your iPad and send them from your iPhone.<br /><br /><br />ENHANCEMENTS<br /><br />- Delete items from the pasteboard by tapping the new delete button<br />- Refinement of icons and button spacing through the app<br />- Adjusted the size of the tool editor<br />- Pen opacity control now displays in the ink color<br />- Highlighted tools and menus now use a higher contrast black and white scheme<br />- Pen Dock layout fine tuned for smaller devices<br />- Timing improved so selecting tools is more responsive<br />- Range of greys increased in tool editor<br />- Pencil Case interface refined<br /><br /><br />BUG FIXES<br /><br />- Fixed an issue that could cause the Pen Opacity control to not respond to first tap<br />- Lots of other minor fixes</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Learn from 53, Flow team. Once upon a time there was an app called Paper, by 53. It failed to improve and progress the way it’s users needed it to and now it’s a piece of crap. You guys are riding a very thin line with having minimal tools and options while still remaining relevant and having a very elegant app that’s a joy to use. As long as apps like Procreate exist, where you only pay once and can be as “pro” or as basic as you want with it, Flow is going to be a challenging sell. You’re riding on brand and aesthetics and that may not carry you forever. <br />But I get the vision of Flow and I personally love it. I’m a graphic designer, so it’s nice having a digital space to draw and think while not worrying about layers or being too granular with my sketches. Flow gives me permission to be messy, and I like that. <br />The paper formats are nice, I’ve found myself using the ruled format from time to time to take notes since Flow has my favorite interface (and sounds!) of any drawing app...so why not? Tools are great, I love the color picker and lack of total freedom while still having a TON of options. I don’t feel restricted with color. <br />I’d be wary with adding much in the way of functionality, but new tools from time to time would be fun. I’m looking forward to the app getting better at what it already does as opposed to becoming more feature-heavy.</p>

    Great for Remote Teaching
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have hastily tried  around 20 different apps in search of a suitable application to perform remote teaching once Covid had forced me out of the classroom. I’m a math professor and needed an application that allowed an unlimited page length. I attempted to get by with others that had other helpful drawing tools, but having to open a new page every couple minutes ultimately made those apps a deal breaker. Now, apples notes was working well, but the inability to save in a format other than its own proprietary file system left me in search of a solution. At this point I discovered Flow which had almost everything that I needed. There is always room for improvement, but the developers seem to be on top of all that while making continual updates as well as creating new features (rulers as of late). I would like to see the ability to draw a strait line without having to open the ruler for that, but this is something users can ask for and the developers appear to listen. That one aspect alone is a huge game changer for me. I’m just not used to using software where the devs listen to the customer/users. All in all, flow and it’s other apps have proved to be absolutely essential for teaching remotely. I could go on and on about how I use the features to create a learning environment that makes the remote learning process much less painless for both me and my students, but I’d suggest give it a try.</p>

to Flow 2.5 – this is a huge update with exciting new features and enhancements to the existing things you already love.\n\n\nSHAREPLAY\n\nFlow has pioneered collaboration in a drawing app and with SharePlay, you can now automatically share a Flow document while on FaceTime. Strokes appear in realtime so it’s just like sharing a piece of paper, wherever you are.\n\nTo use SharePlay, ensure all devices have been updated to iOS 15.1 or above and when on FaceTime just open Flow and follow the prompts.  If other participants do not have a Flow membership, they will still be able to collaborate with you whilst on the call.\n\nSpecial mention to our tireless Adam D who has spent many hours on FaceTime calls with himself whilst in the testing phase of the SharePlay feature.  Adam1, please remember Adam2 is probably not real but we hope you created some wonderful art together.\n\n\nPEN SETS\n\nPen Sets is a huge new feature we are really excited to get in your hands. It’s a simple and powerful new way to use pens in Flow that will improve how you work and create. Instead of a single dock of pens, you can now create multiple sets of pens and quickly swap between them.\n\nFor example you can now curate a set of pens for taking notes, and another set for colored pencil sketching, and swap between them with either a gesture or the new Pen Sets button on the Pen Dock. You can create multiple set of pens with a range of colors for easy access. \n\nFlow will remember which of your Pen Sets you were using for each document and automatically switch to the last set you were using as you move between documents.  \n\nOn the Pen Sets screen you can swipe between all your Pen Sets, create new ones and edit them. When editing you can add a name for the Pen Set and re-arrange the pens within it. You can tap on each pen to edit it individually. You can also delete, duplicate and drag pens between your sets.\n\nYou can even share Pen Sets with other people by sending them a special link. Sharing is caring right? \n\n\nNEW EYEDROPPER\n\nWe’ve improved both the eyedropper and quick color grid tools. In fact they’ve merged (Voltron style) into a more powerful tool than you can possibly imagine. The new eyedropper icon on the Tool Editor replaces what was previously the Quick Color Grid button. Press and hold on it to instantly activate the eyedropper.  \n\nWhen the eyedropper is active, the Tool Editor changes to display a redesigned color grid with a range of shade and tint variations on the current color. You can drag over these to select one, or drag over the canvas or pens to pick a new color. The eyedropper itself now displays as a ring, with one half showing your existing color for comparison.\n\nIMESSAGE STICKER APP\n\nDraw your own custom set of iMessage stickers from Flow. When you save selections from your documents into the pasteboard, they automatically become available in the new Flow iMessage app.  Your stickers are synced between devices so you can create them on your iPad and send them from your iPhone.\n\n\nENHANCEMENTS\n\n- Delete items from the pasteboard by tapping the new delete button\n- Refinement of icons and button spacing through the app\n- Adjusted the size of the tool editor\n- Pen opacity control now displays in the ink color\n- Highlighted tools and menus now use a higher contrast black and white scheme\n- Pen Dock layout fine tuned for smaller devices\n- Timing improved so selecting tools is more responsive\n- Range of greys increased in tool editor\n- Pencil Case interface refined\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n- Fixed an issue that could cause the Pen Opacity control to not respond to first tap\n- Lots of other minor fixes","releaseDate":"2021-10-26"},{"versionDisplay":"2.5","releaseNotes":"Welcome to Flow 2.5 – this is a huge update with exciting new features and enhancements to the existing things you already love.\n\n\nSHAREPLAY\n\nFlow has pioneered collaboration in a drawing app and with SharePlay, you can now automatically share a Flow document while on FaceTime.

You simply place your iPad and iPhone side by side, open Flow on both of them and through magic (or rather some very clever coding) your tools are shown on your iPhone.

Here’s what you can do:\n\n- Add images to your document from Photo Library or Files (including iCloud, Dropbox, Adobe Creative Cloud, Box, OneDrive, Google Drive, Amazon)\n- Take photos directly in Flow and then draw on top of them\n- Paste images from your clipboard, even from your other devices like Mac using Universal Clipboard\n- Drag and drop to grab images from other apps\n- Use the Lasso Knife tool for rotating, resizing and moving your image \n- Duplicate images to save you from adding the image again\n- Change the opacity by using the long press menu\n\n\nMORE\n\n- All new sync engine - performance and stability are better than ever thanks to our all new sync engine, built from the ground up.\n- Flow on iPhone - now opens documents in read-only mode so it’s easier to navigate without accidentally drawing.  Tap and hold the pen icon to open your tools.\n- Clipboard - copy lasso selections to your clipboard and paste into other Flow documents.

Once upon a time there was an app called Paper, by 53. It failed to improve and progress the way it’s users needed it to and now it’s a piece of crap. You guys are riding a very thin line with having minimal tools and options while still remaining relevant and having a very elegant app that’s a joy to use. As long as apps like Procreate exist, where you only pay once and can be as “pro” or as basic as you want with it, Flow is going to be a challenging sell. You’re riding on brand and aesthetics and that may not carry you forever. \nBut I get the vision of Flow and I personally love it. I’m a graphic designer, so it’s nice having a digital space to draw and think while not worrying about layers or being too granular with my sketches. Flow gives me permission to be messy, and I like that. \nThe paper formats are nice, I’ve found myself using the ruled format from time to time to take notes since Flow has my favorite interface (and sounds!) of any drawing app...so why not? Tools are great, I love the color picker and lack of total freedom while still having a TON of options. I don’t feel restricted with color. \nI’d be wary with adding much in the way of functionality, but new tools from time to time would be fun. I’m looking forward to the app getting better at what it already does as opposed to becoming more feature-heavy.","title":"Don’t add much, just make it better.","userName":"everette23"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7170457952","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-04-01T11:38:48Z","developerResponse":{"id":22032139,"body":"Hi - thank you so much!

I’m a math professor and needed an application that allowed an unlimited page length. I attempted to get by with others that had other helpful drawing tools, but having to open a new page every couple minutes ultimately made those apps a deal breaker. Now, apples notes was working well, but the inability to save in a format other than its own proprietary file system left me in search of a solution. At this point I discovered Flow which had almost everything that I needed. There is always room for improvement, but the developers seem to be on top of all that while making continual updates as well as creating new features (rulers as of late). I would like to see the ability to draw a strait line without having to open the ruler for that, but this is something users can ask for and the developers appear to listen. That one aspect alone is a huge game changer for me. I’m just not used to using software where the devs listen to the customer/users. All in all, flow and it’s other apps have proved to be absolutely essential for teaching remotely. I could go on and on about how I use the features to create a learning environment that makes the remote learning process much less painless for both me and my students, but I’d suggest give it a try.","title":"Great for Remote Teaching","userName":"tcoake"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7764043027","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-09-02T22:35:36Z","developerResponse":{"id":24924829,"body":"Hi - thank you so much for taking the time to leave us this amazing review!

Everything is exactly how I’ve wished drawing programs would be and feels completely natural. I got an iPad hoping to reignite my passion for art but didn’t have much luck because the programs I was using didn’t flow (no pun intended) or feel natural. I felt held back. Switching to Flow has brought everything I loved about art back full-force. It’s easy to use and just feels “right.” For the first time in years I’ve been looking forward to drawing every second of my day- during work all I can think about is how excited I am to draw during break, and after my break, I can hardly wait to get home to keep drawing. Art was such an important thing to me growing up and losing it hit me hard. Flow bringing my enthusiasm back means more to me than I could put into words. **Edit: I originally wrote this saying that I wished layers would be added, but after a few days of usage, I take that back. I’ve quickly adjusted to not using layers (though I will say, I’m used to using 2-3 layers at most, so there wasn’t a huge readjustment I had to go through) and I prefer the program without them. I never noticed before how much layers stall and complicate the process. So, I truly and honestly wouldn’t change anything about Flow. I honestly think it’s the perfect art program.","title":"Dream come true","userName":"murdernocturne"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4994975778","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-10-22T00:36:19Z","rating":4,"review":"I fell in love with the beautiful UI and clean aesthetic of this app during my demo, and will definitely be willing to pay the reasonable $12/yr to keep enjoying it (please just don’t bump that price back up to $30). The sight of my digital notebook spreads looking just like my physical ones is super satisfying; it truly does make me want to keep writing and writing, whether it’s journal entries, work notes, or sketches.\n\nThere are still some visible rough edges, though. Resolution gets very blurry when you scroll through pages of a single file, and there’s no way to zoom out and view the whole thing. The minimal interface is a selling point so they shouldn’t clutter it, but certain organizational features and customization options (ex. better file management, the ability to save default page setups) are absent, and sorely missed. I expect quality from Moleskine and think, especially since this not just a paid app but part of a subscription service, they still have work to do.

I consider that this app is freshly made and so many features are on the way, and the team of developers is attentive to community suggestions although it is a small team. You can tell a good app by its developer response, so I have a lot of hope for the future of this one. I’m going to use the app more as it evolves, but I’m very pleased now. As to anyone who claims the app is too expensive—$12 once a year is not too much to pay if you pay about that much for a notebook you use in your hands from a bookstore. This app is a well executed attempt to emulate that personal experience with a paper notebook. That’s not easy, but it’s one of the reasons I purchased my iPad Pro with pencil. And if you’re a user that has the same intent as me, who’s already spent $900 or so on an iPad and pencil for that experience, another $12 every year is well worth it for the value returned.

Seems to bug out after I use the eraser tool, the board stops receiving input, though I can change tools. I’m having to restart the app every 2-3 minutes. I’m surprised this build passed internal+apple review. If this continues, I will be asking for my money back.\n\nLong-term issue – Clipping Tool (needs to be fixed)\nWith this app you can draw, erase and change colors. No rulers, no guides, no mirroring. The only reason this app is better than a paper notebook is because you can theoretically edit drawings, except the tool used to select and move parts of your drawing is completely broken.

This led us to make documents in Flow infinite width so you can stay immersed.  Create your own set of tools just like a virtual pencil case so you don’t need to constantly adjust colours, size and style.  You can have five markers in shades of blue or just a single black pen in the ideal size—it’s up to you!\n\nFlow’s flexibility serves amateurs and professionals alike, offering powerful art tools in an accessible format. With Flow, everyone can create sketches, lists, storyboards, designs, handwritten notes, floor plans, recipes, diagrams, journals and works of art.

We’ve put lots of work into making the app the best it can be, and we read every single review you write. If you enjoy the app and want to leave a review, we’d really appreciate it!"},"versionHistory":[{"versionDisplay":"2.5.1","releaseNotes":"Welcome to Flow 2.5 – this is a huge update with exciting new features and enhancements to the existing things you already love.\n\n\nSHAREPLAY\n\nFlow has pioneered collaboration in a drawing app and with SharePlay, you can now automatically share a Flow document while on FaceTime. Strokes appear in realtime so it’s just like sharing a piece of paper, wherever you are.\n\nTo use SharePlay, ensure all devices have been updated to iOS 15.1 or above and when on FaceTime just open Flow and follow the prompts.  If other participants do not have a Flow membership, they will still be able to collaborate with you whilst on the call.\n\nSpecial mention to our tireless Adam D who has spent many hours on FaceTime calls with himself whilst in the testing phase of the SharePlay feature.  Adam1, please remember Adam2 is probably not real but we hope you created some wonderful art together.\n\n\nPEN SETS\n\nPen Sets is a huge new feature we are really excited to get in your hands. It’s a simple and powerful new way to use pens in Flow that will improve how you work and create. Instead of a single dock of pens, you can now create multiple sets of pens and quickly swap between them.\n\nFor example you can now curate a set of pens for taking notes, and another set for colored pencil sketching, and swap between them with either a gesture or the new Pen Sets button on the Pen Dock. You can create multiple set of pens with a range of colors for easy access. \n\nFlow will remember which of your Pen Sets you were using for each document and automatically switch to the last set you were using as you move between documents.  \n\nOn the Pen Sets screen you can swipe between all your Pen Sets, create new ones and edit them. When editing you can add a name for the Pen Set and re-arrange the pens within it. You can tap on each pen to edit it individually. You can also delete, duplicate and drag pens between your sets.\n\nYou can even share Pen Sets with other people by sending them a special link. Sharing is caring right? \n\n\nNEW EYEDROPPER\n\nWe’ve improved both the eyedropper and quick color grid tools. In fact they’ve merged (Voltron style) into a more powerful tool than you can possibly imagine. The new eyedropper icon on the Tool Editor replaces what was previously the Quick Color Grid button. Press and hold on it to instantly activate the eyedropper.  \n\nWhen the eyedropper is active, the Tool Editor changes to display a redesigned color grid with a range of shade and tint variations on the current color. You can drag over these to select one, or drag over the canvas or pens to pick a new color. The eyedropper itself now displays as a ring, with one half showing your existing color for comparison.\n\nIMESSAGE STICKER APP\n\nDraw your own custom set of iMessage stickers from Flow. When you save selections from your documents into the pasteboard, they automatically become available in the new Flow iMessage app.  Your stickers are synced between devices so you can create them on your iPad and send them from your iPhone.\n\n\nENHANCEMENTS\n\n- Delete items from the pasteboard by tapping the new delete button\n- Refinement of icons and button spacing through the app\n- Adjusted the size of the tool editor\n- Pen opacity control now displays in the ink color\n- Highlighted tools and menus now use a higher contrast black and white scheme\n- Pen Dock layout fine tuned for smaller devices\n- Timing improved so selecting tools is more responsive\n- Range of greys increased in tool editor\n- Pencil Case interface refined\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n- Fixed an issue that could cause the Pen Opacity control to not respond to first tap\n- Lots of other minor fixes","releaseDate":"2021-10-26"},{"versionDisplay":"2.5","releaseNotes":"Welcome to Flow 2.5 – this is a huge update with exciting new features and enhancements to the existing things you already love.\n\n\nSHAREPLAY\n\nFlow has pioneered collaboration in a drawing app and with SharePlay, you can now automatically share a Flow document while on FaceTime.
