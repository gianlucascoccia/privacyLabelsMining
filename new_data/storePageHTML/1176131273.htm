    Outstanding remote control app

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Having been a network admins for almost two decades, had a lot of experience providing remote support. Used MSTSC, Dameware, VNC and others in an enterprise environment. This app is way faster and very easy to use and setup. A friend of one of the developers told me about this app when it was in beta years ago, and even the early versions worked well. I&#39;ve used it on Windows and macOS and iOS with equal success. Ignore reviews complaining of being scammed, AnyDesk is not liable for the naive who take orders from strangers. I&#39;d also question any review questioning ease of use. If you aren&#39;t tech savvy enough to use AnyDesk, you shouldn&#39;t be using remote control apps.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’m trying to perfect a laptop-free workflow by using my iPad and remote desktop apps instead for when I need portable access to a Mac. Unfortunately AnyDesk is not it. <br /><br />Even though it supports tracking of the native iPad cursor for use with your Mac, you have to perform the bizarre action of double clicking in order to single click. It would almost be forgivable if it worked consistently, but unfortunately it often didn’t register at all and when it did, it acted like a double click. this made accessing menus and ticking checkboxes an absolute act of torture. A simple task that would have taken about 30 minutes if I had been able to click like normal instead took 2 hours, with most of that time trying to click on a checkbox/menu without also clicking out of it.<br /><br />If you just need to scroll and click occasionally, this is the app for you. If you have any heavy-duty productivity apps you’ll need to use, do not download this app.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>About 15 days back, I wanted to have Paytm bank-account statement. I looked for a customer care phone number on the internet. I called him using a website I found on Safari application. The respondent to the call told me to attend another call which someone else was attending. He asked me my name, Paytm account number. Then he asked me to download ‘Any Desk Remote application’ which I did. He then entered my Paytm number somewhere and said that I will be getting an OTP and asked me to tell it to him and I did so. He was taking yhe conversation very quick so, at this point, I got a bit suspicious, as he was asking for more bank details and my debt card details. I furnished no information to him any further and I panicked. Then I went to the bank to find out about any transaction from my bank account. I told the bank manager about what happened and he told me that the man I was talking to was a fraud, and also told me to delete the ‘Any Desk Remote Application’ immediately. I hope you are able to find this review helpful.</p>

We therefore respect the confidentiality of your personal data and always proceed in accordance with the provisions of data protection legislation, in particular, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter the “GDPR”), and follow this Policy.\n\nWith respect to the above, the Company uses this Policy to inform you about how, for what purposes and to what extent the Company uses your personal data and what information about you as a user of the Websites the Company may process.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n“Personal data” means any information relating to a data subject;\n\n“Controller” means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data;\n\n“Data subject” means any identified or identifiable person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;\n\n“Data processor” means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;\n\n“Processing” means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.\n\n2. Basic information about personal data processing conducted by the Company\n\nWe always process your personal data lawfully, fairly, in a transparent manner and for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes. We process personal data only to the minimum necessary extent and we keep them in a form which permits your identification for no longer than is necessary vis-à-vis the purpose of the processing.\n\nWe process your personal data in a manner that sufficiently ensures their integrity and confidentiality, i.e. by appropriate technical or organisational measures and appropriate protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against loss, destruction or damage. We take care to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purpose for which we process them, are erased or rectified without delay.\n\nWe respect the principle of refraining from personal data processing and the principle of data minimisation. We therefore only retain your personal data if it is necessary in order to achieve the purpose of the processing or for various retention periods specified by law. The relevant data are erased in accordance with the law if the relevant purpose ceases to exist as a result of the withdrawal of your consent and/or upon the expiration of the lawful retention period.\n\nFor the above reasons, we use computer security such as a firewall and data encryption to operate our Websites. We have implemented adequate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards and use reliable IT service providers. However, given the nature of the internet, we would like to bring to your attention the fact that certain security gaps may exist in the transmission of personal data via the internet (e.g. in communication via e-mail) and that full protection of personal data preventing third party access is impossible.\n\n3. Legal ground, purpose and extent of the processing of your personal data\n\nOur Company may process your personal data for the following legal grounds and for the following purposes:\n\na. Provision and improvement of and support for our Websites\n\nOur Company processes various information about your online activity, e.g. the time of access to our Websites, the time spent on our websites, conversions (i.e. completed activity on our Websites), etc., for the purposes of technical support and improvement of our Websites as well as monitoring of functionalities thereof (for details regarding the extent of the data being processed see Article 4 (c) - d) of this Policy).\n\nFor this purpose of personal data processing, our Company processes your personal data under the lawful ground of legitimate interest (operation of the Websites, statistical purposes and data security).\n\nb. Contact forms\n\nIf you use the contact forms on our Websites for your queries relating to our Company’s services, we process the personal data provided by you to the following extent: your name, e-mail address, IP address, customer ID, as well as any other personal data that inquirer states in the body of the contact form.\n\nFor these purposes of personal data processing, our Company processes your personal data under the lawful ground of negotiation and performance of a contract (negotiation and performance of AnyDesk software license agreement between our Company and yourself including customer support) and legitimate interest (general, sales and technical related communication between our Company and yourself).\n\nc.

It would almost be forgivable if it worked consistently, but unfortunately it often didn’t register at all and when it did, it acted like a double click. this made accessing menus and ticking checkboxes an absolute act of torture.
