        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I absolutely love this game and have played every day since I found it a month ago. I even spent $25 on the s5 pass to support you guys. I really wanted to give 5 stars but there is one thing that is bugging me to no end. Say you join squad mode, live for several minutes and get some kills and complete things toward missions. But then you die.. it happens right? But I learned the hard way that if you leave the match after dying but anybody in the squad is still going, you don’t get credit for anything you did in that match (kills, dmg or healing done, etc anything that can count towards certain RP missions or daily quests). The only way to get your credit is to stay and spectate until the last squad member dies. Why, why, do you have to spent possibly 20-30 more minutes just sitting there just to get credit for the stuff you already did. I think this is really crappy and doesn’t feel great. Especially since this is a demanding mobile game, why waste 20 more minutes of battery life just sitting there when you can’t play, only spectate. Seriously  come on guys give us this quality of life update, it just makes sense. I would 100% come back and change this review to 5 stars, I have no other complaints about this awesome game.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The game is fun, everything works fine and its enjoyable to play! I have been playing since it came out and no problems what so ever except the fact that hackers have found a way to take advantage! Its not fair because people are actually trying to rank and others are hacking to rank up too. People are putting money into this game and what so we can get screwed once in a while by one person shooting through a wall? Naah its not fair but really what do you do when we report them?? Anyways sometimes when i lay down my player stands back up which got me killed sometimes. Some cars drive silly, they slide or they dont even want to drive normal also sometimes people dont die when i hit them on a legit speed to kill them it just makes that one noise. The bots are cool because free kills and free loot but once i was in a middle of a battle and a bot was shooting me from behind like what the? Or they give our position away quick because we&#39;re killing it or theyre shooting maybe we should not have bots and hackers? The game would be a 5 star and will make more money$$ also you should add the new maps pleasee i know miramar is a new one but it would be nice!!! Im a decent player and i know its not my fault next update u should fix those issues and add that new map please we will enjoy very much! Overall the game is always going to be my favorite battle royale game! Thank you!</p>

    Unfair with purchases

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been playing PUBG for couple years now every time is the same when it comes to purchases. I bought $10 worth of wheel of fortune loot and got absolutely nothin got only a bunch of worthless coupons. It’s obvious that they developers control all the loot that is purchased in order for ppl to spend more money. It’s super frustrating I went back to playing call of duty mobile because they offer more skins all around and are not stingy with the loot. The game play over all is very glitchy and also when they servers kick you out you loose points and the issue is never fixed. Reporting anything to them is useless they never respond and seems like they only want money from people they never update with new maps or offer better loot. Am done with this Game it’s a waste of time. I have to edit my review because I forgot the most important review of them all. Ok I don’t understand how I was playing the game I was downed with a level 2 helmet level 3 body armor my helmet was full at 150 points and body armor at 250 nothing was taken away but I got downed by Someone shooting at me. It makes nooooo sense to have armor and helmets if they won’t take all the damage before being downed!! Plz fix the issue and only then will I return to play the game!! What’s the deal with RP I completed the season am max out at 100 and have missions left I complete the missions by my RP doesn’t stack but yet if I buy RP it will stack y’all need to get this looting stuff straight!</p>

I even spent $25 on the s5 pass to support you guys. I really wanted to give 5 stars but there is one thing that is bugging me to no end. Say you join squad mode, live for several minutes and get some kills and complete things toward missions. But then you die.. it happens right? But I learned the hard way that if you leave the match after dying but anybody in the squad is still going, you don’t get credit for anything you did in that match (kills, dmg or healing done, etc anything that can count towards certain RP missions or daily quests). The only way to get your credit is to stay and spectate until the last squad member dies. Why, why, do you have to spent possibly 20-30 more minutes just sitting there just to get credit for the stuff you already did. I think this is really crappy and doesn’t feel great. Especially since this is a demanding mobile game, why waste 20 more minutes of battery life just sitting there when you can’t play, only spectate. Seriously  come on guys give us this quality of life update, it just makes sense. I would 100% come back and change this review to 5 stars, I have no other complaints about this awesome game.","title":"Almost a 5 star game but....","userName":"vexxor"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2863692451","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-07-08T12:39:45Z","developerResponse":{"id":4145390,"body":"Hello, thank you for bringing this to our notice.

Its not fair because people are actually trying to rank and others are hacking to rank up too. People are putting money into this game and what so we can get screwed once in a while by one person shooting through a wall? Naah its not fair but really what do you do when we report them?? Anyways sometimes when i lay down my player stands back up which got me killed sometimes. Some cars drive silly, they slide or they dont even want to drive normal also sometimes people dont die when i hit them on a legit speed to kill them it just makes that one noise. The bots are cool because free kills and free loot but once i was in a middle of a battle and a bot was shooting me from behind like what the? Or they give our position away quick because we're killing it or theyre shooting maybe we should not have bots and hackers? The game would be a 5 star and will make more money$$ also you should add the new maps pleasee i know miramar is a new one but it would be nice!!! Im a decent player and i know its not my fault next update u should fix those issues and add that new map please we will enjoy very much!

I bought $10 worth of wheel of fortune loot and got absolutely nothin got only a bunch of worthless coupons. It’s obvious that they developers control all the loot that is purchased in order for ppl to spend more money. It’s super frustrating I went back to playing call of duty mobile because they offer more skins all around and are not stingy with the loot. The game play over all is very glitchy and also when they servers kick you out you loose points and the issue is never fixed. Reporting anything to them is useless they never respond and seems like they only want money from people they never update with new maps or offer better loot. Am done with this Game it’s a waste of time. I have to edit my review because I forgot the most important review of them all. Ok I don’t understand how I was playing the game I was downed with a level 2 helmet level 3 body armor my helmet was full at 150 points and body armor at 250 nothing was taken away but I got downed by Someone shooting at me. It makes nooooo sense to have armor and helmets if they won’t take all the damage before being downed!! Plz fix the issue and only then will I return to play the game!!

In squads, the mic and speakers work great, but occasionally, one of our squad members loses mic and messages the team using the type-chat feature, telling us that he can’t hear us; and we can’t hear him.  I spent about an hour trying to fill a custom room (using room cards I earned) on three separate occasions and my mic didn’t work.  I could only type chat with my squad.  The issue happens in the game on a regular basis and has only been happening since the 0.7 update.  The mic works great in the lobby, and suddenly, turns off after either getting on or jumping out of the plane.   No one can hear me, i can’t hear them.  The other 3 all hear each other though.  I have deleted and reinstalled the game, I’ve tried the “repair” button on the login screen, and it keeps happening. It’s so frustrating, especially when we make rooms, spend all that time waiting without chat, and then we have to play the game in silence. \n\nPrevious review:\nThis game runs mint on the iPhone.

However, PUBG mobile does nothing to stop players from using emulators and playing this game on a PC vs an actual mobile device. The game also does absolutely nothing to prevent hackers from destroying the game. It claims that they ban hackers for “ten years” however, you have to report the player, they have to investigate and if they feel they used hacks then yes, that account is banned. But nothing stops that hacker from starting a new account and hacking once again. They don’t block IP addresses. The game also forces you to waste UC (money) attempting to get new items in crates when in reality the likeliness of you obtaining whatever you’re attempting to acquire is never going to happen. So you’re literally just paying them extra UC (money) for repeat items. PUBG mobile also takes away there most popular modes (Payload 2.0) and (Vikindi). They also never give players any actual updated news regarding when or if these modes will ever be returning. Payload 2.0 was the only mode players actually stood a chance against hackers because in this mode, you had the opportunity of using RPGs and other bombs. It’s disappointing that a game would takeaway a mode that allowed players to have a chance against hackers. This game is just out for the money now and no longer cares about what the little guy wants. If you’re not a streamer or a hacker, your opinion is invalid. This game isn’t for you unless you can hack.","title":"Hacker Overload","userName":"MsMesaAZ"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5748866083","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-02T03:09:56Z","rating":1,"review":"So I figured I’d get back on PUBG and give it another try after I recently deleted it. I deleted it because I died wayyyyy too many times from bugs like vehicles exploding for no reason, parachutes not opening causing me to fall to my death, de-sync issues that allow people to kill me after I’ve already been shooting at them, etc. first game back on and I’m crouching behind a crate that I was looting, guy sees me and shoots me twice so I move. I can literally see him (third person view) on the other side of the crate about 50 meters away. He continues to shoot at the crate while I first aid myself. Now, still crouched behind a metal crate with ZERO of my body exposed, he continues shooting at the crate and kills me through solid metal. Yeah, true story. Why was I crouching behind a metal crate? Because every other time I’ve ever done that it’s worked perfectly fine. So just as I’m about to give the game another shot, I discover yet another bug in this horrible mess of a nonsense game. It’s sad too because the game has potential, yet every time I see an update it’s like “oh look we came up 1,000 more hats you can wear” as opposed to fixing the issues that make the game a nightmare to play. My advice to the consumer, don’t download this game unless you are in the mood to throw your mobile device across the room in a fit of rage after spending 15 plus minutes in a match, only to die from something ridiculous that’s usually completely out of your control.","title":"Disappointed","userName":"sps1323"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3639697485","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-01-12T03:15:15Z","developerResponse":{"id":6801231,"body":"Hello, if you are currently experiencing a technical issue, or you have a comment, concern or suggestion, please contact us at PUBGMOBILE_CS@tencentgames.com with the exact details and we will gladly assist you as quickly as we can.","modified":"2019-01-12T10:39:03Z"},"rating":3,"review":"This is a great game overall, but the reason I gave this game 3 stars, is because this game is way too easy, you’ll only run into a couple players on your way around the map, and it only takes a couple shots with a pistol to kill them, but it is nice to make myself feel good after crashing my vehicle too many times. \n    The map on the other hand is WAY too big. It is very hard to land at a location far away from the airplane. And if you do manage to make it, the safe zone is always too far away, and now you die in the storm because the map is too big and the matches are too long. \n    Which brings me to the 3rd reason, and ways PUBG could improve their game. The matches are too long, so when you play a game, and you are about 20minutes in, and you die, you don’t play anymore, you go to another app. So if you decreased the amount of time in the match, you will have more people playing the game, and more often too. I can’t stress enough how important it is to keep the matches short, when you win a game, it typically takes about 25-35mins to do so. So if you take this down to about 10minutes per match, most people will have the time to play more, plus you could play 3 rounds in the time it takes to play one. \n    So in conclusion, if you are going to improve the game in some major ways, this is the route to go.","title":"Review","userName":"Wishinitweremore"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3659280871","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-01-17T05:52:25Z","developerResponse":{"id":6884018,"body":"Hello, we're sorry that you are so frustrated with the connection and lag issues.

A black box will pop up and say, “no response form server.” Then it takes us back to the lobby where it tells us, “You were killed in the last match.” No, we weren’t. There is also a horrible lagging issue! I know it’s not because of my device or internet connection because all of my friends from different areas are having the same exact issues. Also, customer service was no help and quite annoying as there was no immediate help. You write your response in the chat and you receive a few automated responses that basically blame you and your internet connection. Then it gives you the option to actually talk to someone but by then you’re just annoyed and don’t want to play. \n\nThis game has had a history of glitches and sometimes hackers. Sometimes you’ll be running but you won’t be able to move and you’re just running in place. Sometimes I’m  shooting at someone fairly near by and they’ll disappear into thin air, not hiding behind rocks or trees.  They need to up their security and fix all of these issues or players will lose interest and switch to fortnite.. just kidding haha! But seriously the lag, the glitches, the hackers, the server time outs are a hassle and mess up your rank and prizes.","title":"Fun game but has too many issues all the time.","userName":"A very very upset customer"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2719738640","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-06-18T18:21:07Z","rating":4,"review":"When this first came out on the App Store, I was playing rules of survival. However, R.O.S was dying, and the game was getting laggier and laggier, so I switched to PUBG Mobile. I had known beforehand that my first few matches were going to be completely or almost completely bots, so I didn’t really feel accomplished with my first few wins. As I played the game more and more though, less and less bots were included in matches, and I wasn’t winning as often. But even in high ranked matches there are still bots, and they can get very annoying. For example, if you’re in a building for more than five minutes, you will have a bot spawn outside and circle the building until you kill it. This can give your position away and can get you killed. I only have one other problem with this game, and that’s trying to get the app fully loaded. I have an iPhone 6, and it can take up to ten tries to get the app running. A lot of the time the game will freeze on the tencent logo and not go anywhere. Sometimes the game will just crash mid-load. The checking updates and loading screens can also freeze and crash the game. Strangely, once in the game it runs very well. It’s just the loading into the app is difficult. This is what led to the four star review.","title":"Good, runs better than ros","userName":"1123ThisGuy3211"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3846139080","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-03-05T17:04:56Z","rating":4,"review":"I’m in a weird period in my life where I don’t get to play games as much as I use to. Growing up, I spent countless hours in front of the TV with my PlayStation playing the greats like Final Fantasy to pulling all nighters and skipping school for midnight releases for games like Halo 3. Nowadays I’m lucking to have two hours to myself to sit down, thinking the purchase of a Nintendo switch would be the answer to all my questions, I invested but soon found out that outside of Zelda, I had a hard time forming a habit to play it. Over the years I found mobile games to have a little more meat to them with classics like Final Fantasy getting ports and gems like Transistor playing wonderful on iOS, that I’m more so leaning to these whenever I feel an itch to play a game especially when I'm at arms reach of an iPhone or an iPad. I enjoy FPS and love to play matches online, thanks to the Halo days and Fortnight and Pubg are great games but the lack of controller support for this really stinks. so though I enjoy Pubg a lot more and I’m fine with touch screen games, having controller support goes along way. Playing Final Fantasy and Transistor with a MFi controller made the quality of the game better. For this reason, Ive downloaded Fortnite and deleted Pubg. Hopefully this will change someday.","title":"Want this to be
