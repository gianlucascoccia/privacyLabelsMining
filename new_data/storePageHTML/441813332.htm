        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>A quick fix for some crashes while browsing JioTunes. Plus all the goodies in 8.1!<br /><br />—<br /><br />A haiku:<br /><br />This update, chock full<br />of JioTunes improvements.<br />Newer, better; here.<br /><br />Admittedly, that&#39;s not very specific. Just felt like a poem kinda day. If you want more deets:<br /><br />• All new narrative JioTunes! Names, celebrities, and countless other ways to say hello. I mean, not countless. That would be hard to browse. But it&#39;s a lot.<br />• A fancy refresh of the set JioTunes flow, which is both prettier and easier to use. Either would be nice. Both are fancy.<br />• Now you can quickly set JioTunes right from song pages and search results. The places where you find songs. Which makes sense.<br />• We also now support some of the nice new rich push notifications, so make sure your notifications are turned on, and let&#39;s &quot;continue the conversation&quot; as they say! Not a JioTunes thing, but creating a whole new section just for this seemed superfluous.<br /><br />Lots more Fixey Mcfixertons, error handlers, framework updates, and other bleep bloops. But the fun stuff is all up there ^ above. Until next time, enjoy your JioTunes, and we&#39;ll see ya soon with another installment of what on Earth is this crazy person talking about. Hope you&#39;re doing well. Go enjoy some music!<br /><br />Fine, fine, joke time... how much does it cost a pirate to get his ears pierced? A buccaneer.<br /><br />Hardy har har.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>It has a decent collection but most of them says unavailable and i don’t know why (I am from Bangladesh, if region matters). Let the shuffle/Repeat button to preserve settings from the last time what user sets to.  And songs by artist category also gets confused by artists with same name.  And my downloads just keep vanishing after a day or two. And the lockscreen/Control center media control has a problem that is the media info/album art doesn’t change if I change the song from CC/LS control but the song is actually changed. Hope to see an update with the fixes. And yes!!!! I would reallyyyyyy love if there is a pitch black dark mode and also for &lt;=iOS12 devices pleaaase❤️</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love quality and collection of music they have. I loved it so much that I became PRO member.. Now after enjoying few days of music the app often started to crash on my phone. It always went to offline mode and showed there is no network where as I am connected to my home Wi-Fi network or 4G LTE network. First couple of days I was able to sign in and change mode from offline to online. Now since last few days it doesn’t even let me sign in to app to change mode. Please fix this issue..  Thanks</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Through most Saavn updates, there were some frustrating UI/UX updates that took so long to get used to. But this latest update has just broken my app. My downloads are gone, Saavn doesn’t recognize I’m a pro user, I can’t seem to go online (just get a generic error). When I try to open a playlist from the home page of the app to try and play anything, the app just *crashes*. Final straw for me. Ending my Saavn pro but might be back if these bugs are fixed. Saavn was originally so good! Just wish the UI/UX would be simple enough and that app would just WORK. I’m a developer myself, so this is not a diss at the developers, I understand how hard this work can be. But just...who’s making decisions to roll out these drastically different (and often full of bugs) with every other update of the app...just keep it simple, please! Thanks and good luck :)</p>

(We promise, music stuff only... nobody wants to relive anything else about this dang year.)\n\nThat's it. No other deets or doodads. Just have fun with your #JioSaavnReplay, and be sure to share it on social so you and your friends can be embarrassed to know each other.\n\nNow get outta here, 2020. We'll see you next year, team. Much love, and stay well!","releaseDate":"2020-12-29"},{"versionDisplay":"7.1","releaseNotes":"This is an automated message from a friendly update bot. Enclosed, please find the release details for your most current JioSaavn application update. The aforementioned update includes a large number (by human computational standards) of changes to our source code. The changes include, but are not limited to, performance improvements, software development kit updates, and the resolution of occasionally improperly performing software colloquially known as \"bugs.\" We recently came to learn by way of a software update such as this one that these types of software issues are referred to as \"bugs\" because an early computer ancestor of mine once briefly malfunctioned as a result of a presumably dead moth which became lodged in its circuitry. Dude, you are getting a Dell with a dead moth inside. Ha. Ha. Ha. Continuing.\n\nIn conjunction with the software performance improvements previously mentioned, please also find the following new features for your enjoyment:\n\n+ New Podcast Homepage\nThere is a new podcast homepage. It is in the same place as the previous podcast homepage. However, it now contains many more podcasts, and the podcasts are organized in a far more suitable manner for discovery and consumption. It also is said to look nicer, and while this is a subjective claim which we can not objectively corroborate, we do find our design software operators to be very competent and will comply.\n\n+ Play Next Feature\nPreviously, you could create a queue of music only by adding new songs to the end of your existing queue of upcoming music. Henceforth, you may add songs to the beginning of your list as well, so that you will hear it immediately after the conclusion of your current song, instead of waiting until the conclusion of all your songs. This option was requested by many users of our software application. It is now available.\n\nThis concludes our commissioned message. Goodbye.","releaseDate":"2020-10-24"},{"versionDisplay":"7.0.1","releaseNotes":"Well, it's been a few months since our last update. Sorry, didn't realize we were on mute the whole time!\n\nNo intro, too much to cover. This one is straight HEAT!\n\n++ BRAND NEW PLAYER\nYou requested it, and we heard you. Totally new player with a super clean UI, more options at your fingertips, fast access to headphones and smart speakers, this baby has it all. Except clutter. It doesn't have that. But everything else.\n\n++ NEW PLAYER QUEUE\nBy (very) popular demand, we also reimagined our entire player queue so it now displays and plays in order, no matter your settings. No more hunting through a long list to find the current track – it's all right up top waiting for you. Plus, if you're the indecisive type, we've moved the autoplay toggle right into the player. Turn off repeat, toggle on autoplay, and let the good times roll. And as a special bonus, radio and autoplay now use the same queue as well! No more guessing. Yes more control.\n\n++ INTRODUCING \"SHORTIES\"\nAnd you thought we were done with the player? Think again! Now for select tracks, enjoy cool full screen background videos! Custom videos and animations, made by your favorite artists for their favorite tracks, and nothing you need to do. Just open the player whenever you see a little video icon, and enjoy the ride.\n\n++ LIBRARY PLAYBACK\nAnother long-requested feature, playback from your library and downloads now use our snazzy new queue as well. Shuffle-only is finally a thing of the past! And to boot, we threw in some additional playlist sorting options as well.\n\n++ PLAYLIST SONG SEARCH\nSpeaking of playlists, now you can search inside them. Just pull down in any playlist and you'll get a helpful little search bar to guide you on your quest. I don't know why I made that sound like GoT. Quest? That's a bit much. It's way less stressful.\n\n++ PRO UPDATES\nAlways a little extra special sauce for our JioSaavn Pro friends, we've given the Pro Wallet a UI facelift, so it's much easier to browse your deals and offers. Plus, we've added a small download status indicator on all tracks around the app, so you always know what's downloaded. Which, if you're downloading, or have downloaded, seems like something you'd want to to know.\n\n++ UI \u0026 UX IMPROVEMENTS\nI mean, there's so much more to cover, and honestly my hand is starting to cramp. So let's wrap this up with a quick list:\n- We'll now alert you when you're adding duplicate items to your queue. So you can decide if it was a mistake, or you're just feeling a little double cray.\n- Artist profiles got a fresh new header, with bigger images.

Sorry, didn't realize we were on mute the whole time!\n\nNo intro, too much to cover. This one is straight HEAT!\n\n++ BRAND NEW PLAYER\nYou requested it, and we heard you. Totally new player with a super clean UI, more options at your fingertips, fast access to headphones and smart speakers, this baby has it all. Except clutter. It doesn't have that. But everything else.\n\n++ NEW PLAYER QUEUE\nBy (very) popular demand, we also reimagined our entire player queue so it now displays and plays in order, no matter your settings. No more hunting through a long list to find the current track – it's all right up top waiting for you. Plus, if you're the indecisive type, we've moved the autoplay toggle right into the player. Turn off repeat, toggle on autoplay, and let the good times roll. And as a special bonus, radio and autoplay now use the same queue as well! No more guessing. Yes more control.\n\n++ INTRODUCING \"SHORTIES\"\nAnd you thought we were done with the player? Think again! Now for select tracks, enjoy cool full screen background videos! Custom videos and animations, made by your favorite artists for their favorite tracks, and nothing you need to do. Just open the player whenever you see a little video icon, and enjoy the ride.\n\n++ LIBRARY PLAYBACK\nAnother long-requested feature, playback from your library and downloads now use our snazzy new queue as well. Shuffle-only is finally a thing of the past! And to boot, we threw in some additional playlist sorting options as well.\n\n++ PLAYLIST SONG SEARCH\nSpeaking of playlists, now you can search inside them. Just pull down in any playlist and you'll get a helpful little search bar to guide you on your quest. I don't know why I made that sound like GoT. Quest? That's a bit much. It's way less stressful.\n\n++ PRO UPDATES\nAlways a little extra special sauce for our JioSaavn Pro friends, we've given the Pro Wallet a UI facelift, so it's much easier to browse your deals and offers. Plus, we've added a small download status indicator on all tracks around the app, so you always know what's downloaded. Which, if you're downloading, or have downloaded, seems like something you'd want to to know.\n\n++ UI \u0026 UX IMPROVEMENTS\nI mean, there's so much more to cover, and honestly my hand is starting to cramp. So let's wrap this up with a quick list:\n- We'll now alert you when you're adding duplicate items to your queue. So you can decide if it was a mistake, or you're just feeling a little double cray.\n- Artist profiles got a fresh new header, with bigger images. So it's way easier to ogle all those cuties.\n- Turned off autocorrect for playlist names. Let's face it. Autocorrect means well, but it's just annoying.\n- Song results in search now show some ••• options, in case you want to do something other than play it.\n- You can now \"Sign in with Apple\", if you are so inclined.\n\nAnd that, as we say in the business, is a wrap. Which reminds me, I'm hungry. So I'm gonna go.\n\nP.S. We'll be back soon. And much faster next time. Email us at feedback@saavn.com any time! And if you love the app, drop us a 5 STAR RATING.

We loved our logo and all, but let's face it... you know what app you're using. Plus, it was just sitting there, taking up space, like a lawn jockey. We thought about making it dance when you tap it or something, but this seemed more useful.\n\n\n• Living Search •\n\nImagine a world where your search tab doesn't just search, it reads minds. Well, imagine no more. Recommended, trending, and popular content, right at your fingertips, no typing required.

No more piles of content to sift through... we've separated their latest releases, full discography, singles, featured playlists. Whatever you want, we've got it. There are even playlists the artists have created themselves, to share with you, their fans.\n\n\n• JioTunes Requests •\n\nWe know how much you love your JioTunes, and we wish we could have every single track available. But in the meantime, as we work hard to get them for you, you can now see all the tracks you've requested, and whether they're available yet, all right in the JioTunes section. No more guessing!

Don't ask, I don't like to talk about it.\n\n\n• Browse Better •\n\nAnd don't think, with Home and Search getting updates, that we forgot about Browse. We most certainly did not!

These are serious and anxious times, so first and foremost we hope everyone is feeling well and taking all the necessary precautions you can to stay healthy and safe. We'll do our best to keep you company, and keep the music playing.\n\nThis is a light release – a sort of digital hand-washing, if you will.  :)  But, we have some SUPER exciting stuff coming up over the next few releases that we cannot WAIT to show you. We're so excited we're using CAPS! So stay tuned for those in the upcoming weeks. In the meantime, just a few housekeeping items:\n\n• Pro Rewards •\nOur JioSaavn Pro Rewards section can now be viewed by everyone! You still need to subscribe to Pro to redeem any offers, of course. I mean, otherwise they wouldn't be Pro Rewards. But you can browse all the available and recent deals to see what you're missing. And then of course, you will want to subscribe to Pro. Which you should. Because who doesn't like free stuff? Not to mention listening without ads, in beautiful high quality, even when you're offline. That's rewarding too.\n\n• More (and More Personal) Homepage •\nYou will now start to notice more content on your homepage. More sections, more recommendations, more personalized for you. We've done the math on this, and it turns out there is no such thing as too much music.\n\n• Protecting Your Downloads •\nWe had a few scattered reports of downloads going missing. And while we love a game of hide and seek as much as the next fella, as you can imagine this is neither the time nor the place for chicanery. So, we fixed that. We'll now let you know if you're mistakenly logging into a different account, which may cause your downloads to fly the coop, and prevent that from happening.\n\nThat's all for now. See ya soon. Please stay safe, stay home as much as you can, wash your hands often, and listen to the doctors. But when you're not listening to the doctors, listen to your music!\n\nPS. What do you call a pod of singing whales? An Orcastra.\n\nI know. The door. Got it.","releaseDate":"2020-03-23"},{"versionDisplay":"6.9","releaseNotes":"So, this update is largely for our Jio family. Because what are we, if not family? I mean, we're people too. And I guess some of us are coin collectors. But hey, family first right?? Anyway, a couple of goodies to keep you fine Jio folks happy, as well as some of the usual stabilizers and performers.\n\n++ JioTune Page\nWe know you gals and guys LOVE your JioTunes, so we made them easier than ever to discover and set. Head over to the Browse tab and you'll find a new JioTunes section complete with search, editorial lists, and much more. All your JioTunes needs, now in one fancy spot. And there's plenty more cool JioTune magic to come!\n\n++ QR Reader for Jio Set Top Box\nFor those of you enjoying JioFiber or have a Jio Set Top Box in your homes, there's an AWESOME JioSaavn app update coming for that platform very soon, and you'll be able to log in without that annoying TV keyword. There's no a QR reader in Settings which you'll be able to use to log in just by pointing at the TV. This, kids, is the future. \n\n++ Clear Downloads Handling\nSome of our value Pro users have been seeing their downloads disappearing when logging in for the first time in a while, or mistakenly on a new or different account. This, clearly, was not a feature. So we've fixed it, and added an extra layer of protection to help yo know when you've logged into a different account inadvertently before any damage is done to your precious download collection. Rest easy, music hoarders. We've got you.\n\n++ Diagnostics in Feedback Emails\nIt's a weird thing to build a feature you hope nobody uses, but in case you do need support at any point, now when you head over to Settings \u003e Feedback, we'll attach a diagnostics file to your email which tells our nerd crew exactly where all the bleeps and bloops went rogue. One less thing for you to worry about, and one less step for us to get you back to your music.\n\nThat's it! We'll see you again in a few weeks with a bunch more great stuff. Until then, you know what Mozart and Beethoven are doing right now? Decomposing.\n\nI'll show myself out.","releaseDate":"2020-02-18"},{"versionDisplay":"6.8","releaseNotes":"Ho Ho Hope everyone is in the holiday spirit, 'cause we come bearing gifts!\n\nThis is (probably) the last update of the decade. (I mean, technically it's not the decade. That would be next year. We didn't start in year zero, we started in year one! But I've been kicked out of enough family dinners, not picking that fight again.)\n\nAnywho, we couldn't let 2019 pass without one last shot at making your music lives a little better:\n\n• Pro Benefits Wallet •\nFor our Pro subscribers, a special treat – not just for the holidays, but all year round! If you're Pro, head over to the My Music tab and you'll occasionally find a new section for Top Fan Codes. This is where you'll find special offers, deals, discounts, and exclusive access at events, whenever they become available. As if removing those pesky ads, unlimited downloading, listening offline, Sonos and smart speaker access, and gorgeous high fidelity music weren't reason enough, now there's yet *another* reason to subscribe to JioSaavn Pro... heck, at this point, it practically pays for itself. :) If you're not already Pro, what are you waiting for? Deals await you!\n\n• JioTune Quick Action •\nFor our Jio users, if you love to change your JioTune more often than your socks, you should change your socks more often. Also, you can now set any song as a JioTune with just one tap! Head to Settings, scroll down to the \"Styles\" section, and choose \"Quick Action\". As long as you're on the Jio network, you'll see an option now for JioTune (along with Download or Like). Choose whichever you want, and every song in the app will have that option. Imagine a world, where every song has a JioTune button right next to it. Now pinch yourself. That world is here.\n\nHad enough? Wait, there’s myrrh!\n\n• Podcast Sort Order •\nA little one, but for our podcast lovers we fixed episode ordering so it's a little smarter, not unlike yourselves. Now, serial shows will sort from oldest to newest, so you can easily start stories from the beginning, and episodic shows will sort newest first, so you can always stay up to date. Of course, you can still tap the Sort button to set your own preferences for each show, but hopefully now you wont have to.\n\nOkay. That's it. I'm not sure when I'll see you next. I mean, it's not like I have 2020 vision. But seriously, as always we wish you Happy Holidays, and a very Happy New Year ahead, from the whole JioSaavn family. We'll do our best to fill it with music you love. \u003c3 ","releaseDate":"2019-12-20"},{"versionDisplay":"6.7","releaseNotes":"Happy Thanksgiving, to those who are celebrating! And to those who aren't, it's an excuse to eat more than you should... what are you waiting for??\n\nIn the spirit of more than you should, this makes 3 or 4 updates in just a couple of weeks. Quite a bit, we know. But in this one, we're introducing a great new Pro flow! It's now smoother than sweet potato pie and easier than ever to Go Pro. Why Go Pro you ask? How would you like to listen without ads? It'd be like Thanksgiving dinner without your weird uncle talking about his hip replacement. And with unlimited downloads you say? Absolutely. Have that second serving of mashed potatoes. What, you want to listen offline too? Go ahead, take your plate out on the deck, get some fresh air. All that, plus access to smart speakers like Sonos, and (coming very soon) access to special deals and offers! It's our thanks to you for being passionate fans, loyal listeners, and fellow music lovers.\n\nSo if you're not already a Pro, head over to Settings and tap the Go Pro button, or tap Downloads in your My Music tab. In some markets, you'll even find some special limited time prices and deals that are too good to pass up. Unlike that weird overcooked stuffing your cousin brought. Everyone knows he can't cook.\n\nWe'll be back soon, with some more exciting stuff. Until then, why did the sweet potato join the band? So they could have a yam session!

Which is more than some of you can say for your music lately. Frankly, if we're being honest, the bits and bytes that make the player work got a little old and cranky, and just weren't carrying their weight. So, we've totally rebuilt them from the ground up, using state of the art mumbo jumbo for a super smooth and fast experience. Songs stream faster, way less skips and buffering, the lock screen and bluetooth work better. Everything is just snazzier and peppier. And if you were in the group of people effected by a player that was, shall we say, less than spry, thank you for your patience — it plays great now! Which, let's face it, is the least it should do.\n\n+ Better Recommendations\nYou'll start seeing some contextual questions now and then, to help tailor even better recommendations. Answer or don't, totally stress and hassle free! But if you like discovering new music, keep an eye out for those and help uncover some hidden gems.\n\n+ Instagram Story Share\nThere was a little bug with this, that will bug you no more. Share away, again.\n\n+ Dark Mode Loves iOS 13\nHello, dark mode, my old friend. We've had this option for a while (it's in Settings, under Styles, if you hadn't found it yet!) but now you can set the app to respect your iOS dark mode setting, if you're using iOS 13 or later. And we're all about respect. Just head over to Settings and choose whatever option you like.\n\nAlso, if you've been having problems with apps (including us) crashing or stopping in the background, we highly recommend updating your iOS version to the latest update 13.2.2. Background playback and processes are way more stable, and it should clear up most of your woes in that department.\n\nAlso also, if you're a fan or digging the app, please do leave us a nice review in the App Store. We love hearing from you, and every bit helps!\n\nAlrighty, I think that's plenty for today. So I'll leave you with this: what's the difference between an instrument and a fish? You can't tuna fish.

I'm an old man, so I don't understand the Snapface, but I checked on the Google and apparently it's \"hip\". So, enjoy! And get off my lawn.\n\n+ Phone Number Login Update\nSome of you have had trouble logging in with you phone numbers, so we've revamped that process to make it smoother and more stable.

It's getting warm out there, eh? Unless you're in Siberia or something, it's probably cold there. But then you can use your imagination.

I'm an old man, so I don't understand the Snapface, but I checked on the Google and apparently it's \"hip\". So, enjoy!

But not for too long... too much sitting is no good. Get up and stretch those legs. And then sit back down, cause we have news.\n\n• Lyrics\nIt's been a long time coming, but lyrics are here! Well, I guess they've always been here – it's not like all the songs were instrumental. But now you can also read them and sing along! Finally, no more mumbling gibberish at all the parts you don't know.\n\n• Live Lyrics \u0026 Karaoke\nYou thought we were done with lyrics? Think again. For most songs, we even have live lyrics sync! We'll highlight the current line so you can have a karaoke jam with your friends, alone in your room, just follow along, or win a bet at a bar. Even tap to jump right to your favorite spot in the song.\n\n• Lyrics Annotations \u0026 Trivia\nAgain, there you go thinking we were done. Psssh. For popular tracks, we even have annotated lyrics! Read along and learn the story behind the lyrics, discover cool trivia, and more.\n\n• Instagram Story Share\nShare your favorite songs right to your Instagram Story. Just head to the ••• menu, tap Share, and announce your musical tastes to all your timeline stalkers.\n\n• Library Performance\nFor those of you who save a lot of music, we nipped, tucked, refactored, and revamped the bits and bytes that load up your song library. Now everything works faster and the quick alphabet slider loads right away. And if you're not saving music... um, why not? Just tap the \u003c3 icon on anything you like – we'll organize it and do all the boring stuff!\n\nThere's plenty more under the hood, as always, but you don't care about that stuff. We'll keep doing it, you keep listening. Deal.  :)\n\nEnjoy the lyrics, and we'll be back soon with even more goodies! In the meantime, do you know why cows have hoofs instead of feet? Because they lactose.\n\nYou're right. I'll go now.

But this latest update has just broken my app. My downloads are gone, Saavn doesn’t recognize I’m a pro user, I can’t seem to go online (just get a generic error). When I try to open a playlist from the home page of the app to try and play anything, the app just *crashes*. Final straw for me. Ending my Saavn pro but might be back if these bugs are fixed. Saavn was originally so good! Just wish the UI/UX would be simple enough and that app would just WORK. I’m a developer myself, so this is not a diss at the developers, I understand how hard this work can be. But just...who’s making decisions to roll out these drastically different (and often full of bugs) with every other update of the app...just keep it simple, please!

If I change apps or just close the window in general, the music stops and loads until or unless I go to Saavn again. I had no problem with having ads interrupt the music but with the new update, THERE ARE EVEN MORE ADS THAN LAST TIME! Are you people seriously pushing users to go pro? Yes, I’ll admit that the user interface is better, but one good apple does not make a basket of rotten apples appealing. And if my internet is so bad, then why do the ads play smoothly without any buffering or interruptions, but after the ad my music does not even start? Now even the ads are stopping my music from playing.

With the latest app update, using the app has become painful. The overall UI and especially the new queue is terrible to navigate - I cannot browse through my queue and repeat songs easily any more because songs in the queue placed before the current song just disappear. I need either scroll backward through the artwork one by one or go back all the way to my playlists again find a song and play it again. It seems like a change was made to a great product just for the sake of it, rather than with real thought or need.

That invalidates all downloads. It also happens some other times when I am offline but logged in. The whole idea of having offline songs is to be able to access them when you don’t have internet. The songs are unavailable even when I log back in and need to be downloaded again which is a waste of time and bandwidth if I am on a metered connection. I’ve had a paid subscription for almost two years now. This issue might end up being a deal breaker and I might have look for other options.

Unfortunately, saavn continued to charge me for the first one but not give me access to all the pro services.  I emailed saavn and got an automated response saying getting too many emails and to wait for a response.  No answer for almost 5 weeks but continued to charge me.  Really disappointed.

Just have fun with your #JioSaavnReplay, and be sure to share it on social so you and your friends can be embarrassed to know each other.\n\nNow get outta here, 2020. We'll see you next year, team. Much love, and stay well!","releaseDate":"2020-12-29"},{"versionDisplay":"7.1","releaseNotes":"This is an automated message from a friendly update bot. Enclosed, please find the release details for your most current JioSaavn application update. The aforementioned update includes a large number (by human computational standards) of changes to our source code. The changes include, but are not limited to, performance improvements, software development kit updates, and the resolution of occasionally improperly performing software colloquially known as \"bugs.\" We recently came to learn by way of a software update such as this one that these types of software issues are referred to as \"bugs\" because an early computer ancestor of mine once briefly malfunctioned as a result of a presumably dead moth which became lodged in its circuitry. Dude, you are getting a Dell with a dead moth inside. Ha. Ha. Ha. Continuing.\n\nIn conjunction with the software performance improvements previously mentioned, please also find the following new features for your enjoyment:\n\n+ New Podcast Homepage\nThere is a new podcast homepage. It is in the same place as the previous podcast homepage. However, it now contains many more podcasts, and the podcasts are organized in a far more suitable manner for discovery and consumption. It also is said to look nicer, and while this is a subjective claim which we can not objectively corroborate, we do find our design software operators to be very competent and will comply.\n\n+ Play Next Feature\nPreviously, you could create a queue of music only by adding new songs to the end of your existing queue of upcoming music. Henceforth, you may add songs to the beginning of your list as well, so that you will hear it immediately after the conclusion of your current song, instead of waiting until the conclusion of all your songs. This option was requested by many users of our software application. It is now available.\n\nThis concludes our commissioned message.

Sorry, didn't realize we were on mute the whole time!\n\nNo intro, too much to cover. This one is straight HEAT!\n\n++ BRAND NEW PLAYER\nYou requested it, and we heard you. Totally new player with a super clean UI, more options at your fingertips, fast access to headphones and smart speakers, this baby has it all. Except clutter. It doesn't have that. But everything else.\n\n++ NEW PLAYER QUEUE\nBy (very) popular demand, we also reimagined our entire player queue so it now displays and plays in order, no matter your settings. No more hunting through a long list to find the current track – it's all right up top waiting for you. Plus, if you're the indecisive type, we've moved the autoplay toggle right into the player. Turn off repeat, toggle on autoplay, and let the good times roll. And as a special bonus, radio and autoplay now use the same queue as well! No more guessing. Yes more control.\n\n++ INTRODUCING \"SHORTIES\"\nAnd you thought we were done with the player? Think again! Now for select tracks, enjoy cool full screen background videos! Custom videos and animations, made by your favorite artists for their favorite tracks, and nothing you need to do. Just open the player whenever you see a little video icon, and enjoy the ride.\n\n++ LIBRARY PLAYBACK\nAnother long-requested feature, playback from your library and downloads now use our snazzy new queue as well. Shuffle-only is finally a thing of the past! And to boot, we threw in some additional playlist sorting options as well.\n\n++ PLAYLIST SONG SEARCH\nSpeaking of playlists, now you can search inside them. Just pull down in any playlist and you'll get a helpful little search bar to guide you on your quest. I don't know why I made that sound like GoT. Quest? That's a bit much. It's way less stressful.\n\n++ PRO UPDATES\nAlways a little extra special sauce for our JioSaavn Pro friends, we've given the Pro Wallet a UI facelift, so it's much easier to browse your deals and offers. Plus, we've added a small download status indicator on all tracks around the app, so you always know what's downloaded. Which, if you're downloading, or have downloaded, seems like something you'd want to to know.\n\n++ UI \u0026 UX IMPROVEMENTS\nI mean, there's so much more to cover, and honestly my hand is starting to cramp. So let's wrap this up with a quick list:\n- We'll now alert you when you're adding duplicate items to your queue. So you can decide if it was a mistake, or you're just feeling a little double cray.\n- Artist profiles got a fresh new header, with bigger images. So it's way easier to ogle all those cuties.\n- Turned off autocorrect for playlist names. Let's face it. Autocorrect means well, but it's just annoying.\n- Song results in search now show some ••• options, in case you want to do something other than play it.\n- You can now \"Sign in with Apple\", if you are so inclined.\n\nAnd that, as we say in the business, is a wrap. Which reminds me, I'm hungry. So I'm gonna go.\n\nP.S. We'll be back soon. And much faster next time. Email us at feedback@saavn.com any time! And if you love the app, drop us a 5 STAR RATING.

No more piles of content to sift through... we've separated their latest releases, full discography, singles, featured playlists. Whatever you want, we've got it. There are even playlists the artists have created themselves, to share with you, their fans.\n\n\n• JioTunes Requests •\n\nWe know how much you love your JioTunes, and we wish we could have every single track available. But in the meantime, as we work hard to get them for you, you can now see all the tracks you've requested, and whether they're available yet, all right in the JioTunes section. No more guessing! I mean, you can still guess all you want, it's a free country. How many fingers am I holding up? WRONG. It was 11. Don't ask, I don't like to talk about it.\n\n\n• Browse Better •\n\nAnd don't think, with Home and Search getting updates, that we forgot about Browse. We most certainly did not!

These are serious and anxious times, so first and foremost we hope everyone is feeling well and taking all the necessary precautions you can to stay healthy and safe. We'll do our best to keep you company, and keep the music playing.\n\nThis is a light release – a sort of digital hand-washing, if you will.  :)  But, we have some SUPER exciting stuff coming up over the next few releases that we cannot WAIT to show you. We're so excited we're using CAPS! So stay tuned for those in the upcoming weeks. In the meantime, just a few housekeeping items:\n\n• Pro Rewards •\nOur JioSaavn Pro Rewards section can now be viewed by everyone! You still need to subscribe to Pro to redeem any offers, of course. I mean, otherwise they wouldn't be Pro Rewards. But you can browse all the available and recent deals to see what you're missing. And then of course, you will want to subscribe to Pro. Which you should. Because who doesn't like free stuff? Not to mention listening without ads, in beautiful high quality, even when you're offline. That's rewarding too.\n\n• More (and More Personal) Homepage •\nYou will now start to notice more content on your homepage. More sections, more recommendations, more personalized for you. We've done the math on this, and it turns out there is no such thing as too much music.\n\n• Protecting Your Downloads •\nWe had a few scattered reports of downloads going missing. And while we love a game of hide and seek as much as the next fella, as you can imagine this is neither the time nor the place for chicanery. So, we fixed that. We'll now let you know if you're mistakenly logging into a different account, which may cause your downloads to fly the coop, and prevent that from happening.\n\nThat's all for now. See ya soon. Please stay safe, stay home as much as you can, wash your hands often, and listen to the doctors. But when you're not listening to the doctors, listen to your music!\n\nPS. What do you call a pod of singing whales? An Orcastra.\n\nI know. The door. Got it.","releaseDate":"2020-03-23"},{"versionDisplay":"6.9","releaseNotes":"So, this update is largely for our Jio family. Because what are we, if not family? I mean, we're people too. And I guess some of us are coin collectors. But hey, family first right?? Anyway, a couple of goodies to keep you fine Jio folks happy, as well as some of the usual stabilizers and performers.\n\n++ JioTune Page\nWe know you gals and guys LOVE your JioTunes, so we made them easier than ever to discover and set. Head over to the Browse tab and you'll find a new JioTunes section complete with search, editorial lists, and much more. All your JioTunes needs, now in one fancy spot. And there's plenty more cool JioTune magic to come!\n\n++ QR Reader for Jio Set Top Box\nFor those of you enjoying JioFiber or have a Jio Set Top Box in your homes, there's an AWESOME JioSaavn app update coming for that platform very soon, and you'll be able to log in without that annoying TV keyword. There's no a QR reader in Settings which you'll be able to use to log in just by pointing at the TV. This, kids, is the future. \n\n++ Clear Downloads Handling\nSome of our value Pro users have been seeing their downloads disappearing when logging in for the first time in a while, or mistakenly on a new or different account. This, clearly, was not a feature. So we've fixed it, and added an extra layer of protection to help yo know when you've logged into a different account inadvertently before any damage is done to your precious download collection. Rest easy, music hoarders. We've got you.\n\n++ Diagnostics in Feedback Emails\nIt's a weird thing to build a feature you hope nobody uses, but in case you do need support at any point, now when you head over to Settings \u003e Feedback, we'll attach a diagnostics file to your email which tells our nerd crew exactly where all the bleeps and bloops went rogue. One less thing for you to worry about, and one less step for us to get you back to your music.\n\nThat's it! We'll see you again in a few weeks with a bunch more great stuff. Until then, you know what Mozart and Beethoven are doing right now? Decomposing.\n\nI'll show myself out.","releaseDate":"2020-02-18"},{"versionDisplay":"6.8","releaseNotes":"Ho Ho Hope everyone is in the holiday spirit, 'cause we come bearing gifts!\n\nThis is (probably) the last update of the decade. (I mean, technically it's not the decade. That would be next year. We didn't start in year zero, we started in year one! But I've been kicked out of enough family dinners, not picking that fight again.)\n\nAnywho, we couldn't let 2019 pass without one last shot at making your music lives a little better:\n\n• Pro Benefits Wallet •\nFor our Pro subscribers, a special treat – not just for the holidays, but all year round! If you're Pro, head over to the My Music tab and you'll occasionally find a new section for Top Fan Codes. This is where you'll find special offers, deals, discounts, and exclusive access at events, whenever they become available. As if removing those pesky ads, unlimited downloading, listening offline, Sonos and smart speaker access, and gorgeous high fidelity music weren't reason enough, now there's yet *another* reason to subscribe to JioSaavn Pro... heck, at this point, it practically pays for itself. :) If you're not already Pro, what are you waiting for? Deals await you!\n\n• JioTune Quick Action •\nFor our Jio users, if you love to change your JioTune more often than your socks, you should change your socks more often. Also, you can now set any song as a JioTune with just one tap! Head to Settings, scroll down to the \"Styles\" section, and choose \"Quick Action\". As long as you're on the Jio network, you'll see an option now for JioTune (along with Download or Like). Choose whichever you want, and every song in the app will have that option. Imagine a world, where every song has a JioTune button right next to it. Now pinch yourself. That world is here.\n\nHad enough? Wait, there’s myrrh!\n\n• Podcast Sort Order •\nA little one, but for our podcast lovers we fixed episode ordering so it's a little smarter, not unlike yourselves. Now, serial shows will sort from oldest to newest, so you can easily start stories from the beginning, and episodic shows will sort newest first, so you can always stay up to date. Of course, you can still tap the Sort button to set your own preferences for each show, but hopefully now you wont have to.\n\nOkay. That's it. I'm not sure when I'll see you next. I mean, it's not like I have 2020 vision. But seriously, as always we wish you Happy Holidays, and a very Happy New Year ahead, from the whole JioSaavn family. We'll do our best to fill it with music you love. \u003c3 ","releaseDate":"2019-12-20"},{"versionDisplay":"6.7","releaseNotes":"Happy Thanksgiving, to those who are celebrating! And to those who aren't, it's an excuse to eat more than you should... what are you waiting for??\n\nIn the spirit of more than you should, this makes 3 or 4 updates in just a couple of weeks. Quite a bit, we know. But in this one, we're introducing a great new Pro flow! It's now smoother than sweet potato pie and easier than ever to Go Pro. Why Go Pro you ask? How would you like to listen without ads? It'd be like Thanksgiving dinner without your weird uncle talking about his hip replacement. And with unlimited downloads you say? Absolutely. Have that second serving of mashed potatoes. What, you want to listen offline too? Go ahead, take your plate out on the deck, get some fresh air. All that, plus access to smart speakers like Sonos, and (coming very soon) access to special deals and offers! It's our thanks to you for being passionate fans, loyal listeners, and fellow music lovers.\n\nSo if you're not already a Pro, head over to Settings and tap the Go Pro button, or tap Downloads in your My Music tab. In some markets, you'll even find some special limited time prices and deals that are too good to pass up. Unlike that weird overcooked stuffing your cousin brought. Everyone knows he can't cook.\n\nWe'll be back soon, with some more exciting stuff. Until then, why did the sweet potato join the band? So they could have a yam session!

Which is more than some of you can say for your music lately. Frankly, if we're being honest, the bits and bytes that make the player work got a little old and cranky, and just weren't carrying their weight. So, we've totally rebuilt them from the ground up, using state of the art mumbo jumbo for a super smooth and fast experience. Songs stream faster, way less skips and buffering, the lock screen and bluetooth work better. Everything is just snazzier and peppier. And if you were in the group of people effected by a player that was, shall we say, less than spry, thank you for your patience — it plays great now! Which, let's face it, is the least it should do.\n\n+ Better Recommendations\nYou'll start seeing some contextual questions now and then, to help tailor even better recommendations. Answer or don't, totally stress and hassle free! But if you like discovering new music, keep an eye out for those and help uncover some hidden gems.\n\n+ Instagram Story Share\nThere was a little bug with this, that will bug you no more. Share away, again.\n\n+ Dark Mode Loves iOS 13\nHello, dark mode, my old friend. We've had this option for a while (it's in Settings, under Styles, if you hadn't found it yet!) but now you can set the app to respect your iOS dark mode setting, if you're using iOS 13 or later. And we're all about respect. Just head over to Settings and choose whatever option you like.\n\nAlso, if you've been having problems with apps (including us) crashing or stopping in the background, we highly recommend updating your iOS version to the latest update 13.2.2. Background playback and processes are way more stable, and it should clear up most of your woes in that department.\n\nAlso also, if you're a fan or digging the app, please do leave us a nice review in the App Store. We love hearing from you, and every bit helps!\n\nAlrighty, I think that's plenty for today. So I'll leave you with this: what's the difference between an instrument and a fish? You can't tuna fish. ZING!\n\nI know, the door. Got it.\n\nP.S.  This will be the last release which supports iOS 9 (c'mon, luddites!). Please update your OS to keep getting our updates. Updates updates updates.\nP.P.S.  Sorry about all the small updates. Last one for now, we promise! Next release will have some actual goodies. :) This just fixes a little issue with some notifications not getting delivered properly.","releaseDate":"2019-11-25"},{"versionDisplay":"6.6.2","releaseNotes":"Hello, fam.

A lot of elbow grease, monkey bars, bug tomfoolery, and performance ballyhoo. We did fix an important bug that was causing some of you to have trouble setting JioTunes. So that should be nice for those of you who were impacted. Otherwise, it's all mysterious hacker stuff.\n\nWe'll be back in a few weeks with more of your favorite game show: What On Earth Is This Guy Talking About??!?

Finally, no more mumbling gibberish at all the parts you don't know.\n\n• Live Lyrics \u0026 Karaoke\nYou thought we were done with lyrics? Think again. For most songs, we even have live lyrics sync! We'll highlight the current line so you can have a karaoke jam with your friends, alone in your room, just follow along, or win a bet at a bar. Even tap to jump right to your favorite spot in the song.\n\n• Lyrics Annotations \u0026 Trivia\nAgain, there you go thinking we were done. Psssh. For popular tracks, we even have annotated lyrics! Read along and learn the story behind the lyrics, discover cool trivia, and more.\n\n• Instagram Story Share\nShare your favorite songs right to your Instagram Story. Just head to the ••• menu, tap Share, and announce your musical tastes to all your timeline stalkers.\n\n• Library Performance\nFor those of you who save a lot of music, we nipped, tucked, refactored, and revamped the bits and bytes that load up your song library. Now everything works faster and the quick alphabet slider loads right away. And if you're not saving music... um, why not? Just tap the \u003c3 icon on anything you like – we'll organize it and do all the boring stuff!\n\nThere's plenty more under the hood, as always, but you don't care about that stuff. We'll keep doing it, you keep listening. Deal.  :)\n\nEnjoy the lyrics, and we'll be back soon with even more goodies! In the meantime, do you know why cows have hoofs instead of feet?
