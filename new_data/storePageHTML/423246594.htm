        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Out of all the many places I get my sports content, this might be the best for what it does. It’s very, very easy to stream games live, and if you didn’t catch the game, they do have the condensed version of the game and highlights to watch to keep yourself up to date. There’s also game previews for upcoming games, loads of stats, articles, and videos about a variety of March Madness topics, and just a really streamlined and convenient user experience overall. My one request is for the ability to keep the live stream of the game going after you exit the app, as is possible when I stream with the ESPN or NBA apps. If this had that, it would be perfect. One that I always make sure to download the second week of March for every edition of the tourney.</p>

    App is very useful but has one HUGE flaw

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’d like to start this by saying this app is super convenient and useful during the ncaa basketball tournament. I would rate it 5 stars expect for one huge flaw. When a game finishes, the app is designed so that it gives you menu of other games to chose from to watch next. This seems convenient except it does this WHILE THE GAME YOU ARE WATCHING IS NOT FINISHED. So let’s say you’re watching the end of a very close game, there’s 20 seconds on the game clock, and the ball was just passed in. The clock starts ticking and … opp, the app kicks you out of the game and here are some other games you can watch. This is super annoying and takes away from all of the good things this app has to offer because this “feature” happens at the most important point of a game ,and you can’t turn it off or do anytime about it other than try to get back to the game you were watching as quickly as possible. Hopefully this can be changed, but until that happens, 2 star rating from me.</p>

    A laughably poor experience

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>As a product manager, the best thing about this app is how it makes me feel about myself and my prior work as a point of comparison. <br /><br />Both the decisions and execution driving the user experience this year scream mismanagement and a fundamental misunderstanding of industry standards and best practices. <br /><br />There is no PIP functionality, despite it essentially being a freebie via the operating system. Users are also unable to pause game video. I can only assume both of these decisions were made to force users to watch more preroll, which is required every time the feed is stopped as a result of the app being put in the background. <br /><br />The feed is in chronological order, so the oldest post is at the top. Users are never brought to the bottom of the feed, where they would find the most recent and more relevant content. The top and bottom posts in the feed are semi-obscured by some sort of vignette for... reasons? <br /><br />There is no multi view option, despite this being arguably the most relevant event in the world for such a feature to exist. <br /><br />Even the player control UI - something as simple as the design for active and inactive states on closed captions - is horribly implemented. <br /><br />I feel bad for the teams who worked on this and were either clearly not given the time and tools to succeed, or were in way over their heads. <br /><br />It’s a serviceable app, but in no way is this a product that values the user’s experience.</p>

A representative list of our affiliates is available here.\nWe may share the Information with unaffiliated Partners and third parties (e.g., our third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that wish to market products or services to you. If you wish to opt out from such sharing please visit the How to Contact Us/Opting Out of Marketing Communications section below for further instructions.\nPlease note that the Services covered by this Privacy Policy may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications, or social network integrations) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain information from their visitors. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information, which is subject to their own privacy policies.\n\nIV. COOKIES AND OTHER USER AND AD-TARGETING TECHNOLOGIES.\nWe use cookies and other technologies both to provide our Services to you and to advertise to you. We also may work with Partners to help them advertise to you when you visit other websites or mobile applications, and to help them perform user analytics. These technologies may also be used to analyze how our Users interact with advertising on our Services and elsewhere, and more generally, to learn more about our Users and what services or offers you might prefer to receive. We describe some of these technologies below.\n\nCookies. To enhance your online experience, we and our Partners use \"cookies\", “web beacons” or other tracking technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. We use cookies or other tracking technologies to understand Service and Internet usage and to improve or customize the products, content, offerings, services or advertisements on our Services. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Services (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a Service), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our Services. We also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to help us offer you products, content, offerings or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising when you visit this Service, a Turner Affiliate's Service, or when you visit other websites or applications. We or a third-party platform with whom we work may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized content, offers, services or advertisements on our Services or other sites. These cookies contain no information intended to identify you personally. The cookies may be associated with de-identified demographic or other data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.\nWe, our third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our Partners also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or other networks or Services. This also helps us, our service providers and Partners provide more relevant advertising.\n\nSyncing Cookies and Identifiers. We may work with our Partners (for instance, third party ad platforms) to synchronize unique, anonymous identifiers (such as those associated with cookies) in order to match our Partners' uniquely coded user identifiers to our own. We may do this, for instance, to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device, and thus enable us or others to send ads that are more relevant, match Users to their likely product interests, or better synchronize, cap, or optimize advertising.\nLocally Stored Objects. Services on the Turner Network may employ locally stored objects (\"LSOs\") and other client side storage tracking technologies in certain situations where they help to provide a better user experience, such as to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies, or in order to target or help our Partners target ads, analyze ad performance, or perform user, website or market analytics. For LSOs utilized by Adobe Flash you can access Flash management tools from Adobe's website directly. In addition, some, but not all browsers, provide the ability to remove LSOs, sometimes within cookie and privacy settings.\nDisabling Cookies Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of the Services may be difficult to use or inoperable.\nWe may work with certain third-party companies that use techniques other than HTTP cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity, including those integrated with our Services. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these techniques, and those browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such techniques. To learn more about Interest-Based Advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising by those third parties that are members of DAA's opt-out program, please go to http://www.aboutads.info.\n\nWeb Beacons. We and our Partners may also use \"web beacons\" or clear GIFs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a Service or in an email, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a Service or email. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that Service. Web beacons may also be used to provide information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns (e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.).\nMobile Device Identifiers and SDKs. We also sometimes use, or partner with publishers, publisher-facing, or app developer platforms that use mobile Software Development Kits (\"SDKs\"), or use an SDK with a mobile app that we offer, to collect Information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and Information connected to how mobile devices interact with our Services and those using our Services. A mobile SDK may include technology that is the mobile app version of a web beacon (see \"Web Beacons\" above). These SDKs feature computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services or analytics to be performed. We may use this technology to deliver or help our Partners deliver certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. If you'd like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in the \"Your Ad Choices\" section below.\nBy visiting the Service, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Service through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we send to you.\n\nOur unaffiliated Partners and third parties may themselves set and access their own tracking technologies when you visit our Services and they may have access to information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites or applications when you use the Service. Their use of such tracking technologies is not in our control and is subject to their own privacy policies. \n\nV. YOUR AD CHOICES\nAdvertising enables us to provide the rich content for which Services on the Turner Network are known, and to provide much of this content free of cost to our Users. Thus, we strive to provide you with ads that are relevant to you and for products you may want.\n\nHowever, we also offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based advertisements and the choices available to you, please visit our Ad Choices  page which has general information about certain companies that place these advertisements. You may also find more information about entities involved in online advertising and additional choices you may make through the Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") at the NAI Service, and the Digital Advertising Alliance (the \"DAA\") at the DAA consumer choice Service. Turner is a participant in the online industry's self-regulatory program administered by the DAA and has agreed to adhere to the DAA's principles applicable to interest-based ads.\n\nThe tools provided on the page, as well as the DAA opt-out page and the NAI opt-out page are provided by third parties, not Turner. Turner does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools. When using a mobile application you may receive tailored in-application advertisements. Depending on your device, you may be able to reset your mobile device's advertising identifier at any time by accessing the privacy settings on your mobile device. In addition, each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact (or review the applicable privacy web page of) the applicable platform operator.\n\nVI. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY\n\n1. Linked Services\nSome of the Services contain links to or integrations with other services such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other media services and platforms whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult these other services' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.\n\n2. International Transfer\nThis Service is governed by and operated in accordance with US law. If you are located outside of the US, you use this Service at your own risk. Turner is a company that operates globally so it is necessary to transfer your Information internationally. In particular, your Information will be transferred to and processed in the United States where many of our central databases operate. By using this Service, you acknowledge that the data protection and other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may provide a less comprehensive or protective standard of protection than those in your country, and consent to your Information being collected, processed and transferred as set forth in this Privacy Policy and US law.\n\n3. Data Security\nWe have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the Information we collect online. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the Information that we collect and store.\n\nAlthough we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of Information, we cannot assure you that Information will never be disclosed, altered or destroyed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.\n\n4. How You Can Access or Correct Information\nAccess to certain personal Information that is collected from our Services and that we maintain may be available to you. For example, if you created a password-protected account within our Service, you can access that account to review certain Information you provided. You may also send an e-mail or letter to the following e-mail or street address requesting access to or correction of your personal Information. Please include your registration information for such service such as first name, last name and e-mail address in the request. We may ask you to provide additional information for identity verification purposes, or to verify that you are in possession of an applicable email account.\n\nE-MAIL ADMINISTRATION\nTURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC.\nATTENTION: PRIVACY POLICY COORDINATOR\nONE CNN CENTER, 13 NORTH\nATLANTA, GA 30303\nEMAIL: WMPRIVACY@WARNERMEDIAGROUP.COM\n\n5.

For information about how these technologies work and how we may use them, please go to Section IV, titled Cookies, And Other User And Ad-Targeting Technologies. Sometimes, we may associate cookies with the Information, including de-identified, \"hashed,\"\" or anonymous versions of Information you have provided (such as during registration), in order to send or help our Partners send ads and offers based on your presumed interests or demographic information. We may combine any of the Information we collect, for any of the above purposes, and may sometimes enhance the Information with other information that we obtain from third party sources.

See our Terms of Service for details on our use of content you submit.\n\nIII. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE\n\nWe may disclose the Information as follows:\n\nTo service providers or Partners that we have engaged to perform business-related functions on our behalf. This may include service providers that: (a) conduct research and analytics; (b) create content; (c) provide customer, technical or operational support; (d) conduct or support marketing (such as email or advertising platforms); (e) fulfill orders and user requests; (f) handle payments; (g) host our Services, forums and online communities; (h) administer contests; (i) maintain databases; (j) send or support online or mobile advertising; and (k) otherwise support our Services.\nIn response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena, a law enforcement or government agency's request or similar request.\nWith third parties in order to investigate, prevent, or take action (in our sole discretion) regarding potentially illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to any person, us, or the Services, or violations of our policies, the law or our Terms of Service, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Services.\nWe may transfer some or all of your Information if we, or one of our business units, undergoes a business transition, like a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part of our assets, or if a substantial portion of our or of a business unit’s assets is sold or merged in this way.\nWe may share the Information with Turner Affiliates, so they can provide, improve and communicate with you about their own, or their marketing partners’ products and services. A representative list of our affiliates is available here.\nWe may share the Information with unaffiliated Partners and third parties (e.g., our third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that wish to market products or services to you. If you wish to opt out from such sharing please visit the How to Contact Us/Opting Out of Marketing Communications section below for further instructions.\nPlease note that the Services covered by this Privacy Policy may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications, or social network integrations) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain information from their visitors. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information, which is subject to their own privacy policies.\n\nIV. COOKIES AND OTHER USER AND AD-TARGETING TECHNOLOGIES.\nWe use cookies and other technologies both to provide our Services to you and to advertise to you. We also may work with Partners to help them advertise to you when you visit other websites or mobile applications, and to help them perform user analytics. These technologies may also be used to analyze how our Users interact with advertising on our Services and elsewhere, and more generally, to learn more about our Users and what services or offers you might prefer to receive. We describe some of these technologies below.\n\nCookies. To enhance your online experience, we and our Partners use \"cookies\", “web beacons” or other tracking technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. We use cookies or other tracking technologies to understand Service and Internet usage and to improve or customize the products, content, offerings, services or advertisements on our Services. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Services (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a Service), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our Services. We also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to help us offer you products, content, offerings or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising when you visit this Service, a Turner Affiliate's Service, or when you visit other websites or applications. We or a third-party platform with whom we work may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized content, offers, services or advertisements on our Services or other sites. These cookies contain no information intended to identify you personally. The cookies may be associated with de-identified demographic or other data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.\nWe, our third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our Partners also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or other networks or Services. This also helps us, our service providers and Partners provide more relevant advertising.\n\nSyncing Cookies and Identifiers. We may work with our Partners (for instance, third party ad platforms) to synchronize unique, anonymous identifiers (such as those associated with cookies) in order to match our Partners' uniquely coded user identifiers to our own. We may do this, for instance, to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device, and thus enable us or others to send ads that are more relevant, match Users to their likely product interests, or better synchronize, cap, or optimize advertising.\nLocally Stored Objects. Services on the Turner Network may employ locally stored objects (\"LSOs\") and other client side storage tracking technologies in certain situations where they help to provide a better user experience, such as to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies, or in order to target or help our Partners target ads, analyze ad performance, or perform user, website or market analytics. For LSOs utilized by Adobe Flash you can access Flash management tools from Adobe's website directly. In addition, some, but not all browsers, provide the ability to remove LSOs, sometimes within cookie and privacy settings.\nDisabling Cookies Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of the Services may be difficult to use or inoperable.\nWe may work with certain third-party companies that use techniques other than HTTP cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity, including those integrated with our Services. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these techniques, and those browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such techniques. To learn more about Interest-Based Advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising by those third parties that are members of DAA's opt-out program, please go to http://www.aboutads.info.\n\nWeb Beacons. We and our Partners may also use \"web beacons\" or clear GIFs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a Service or in an email, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a Service or email. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that Service. Web beacons may also be used to provide information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns (e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.).\nMobile Device Identifiers and SDKs. We also sometimes use, or partner with publishers, publisher-facing, or app developer platforms that use mobile Software Development Kits (\"SDKs\"), or use an SDK with a mobile app that we offer, to collect Information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and Information connected to how mobile devices interact with our Services and those using our Services. A mobile SDK may include technology that is the mobile app version of a web beacon (see \"Web Beacons\" above). These SDKs feature computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services or analytics to be performed. We may use this technology to deliver or help our Partners deliver certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. If you'd like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in the \"Your Ad Choices\" section below.\nBy visiting the Service, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Service through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we send to you.\n\nOur unaffiliated Partners and third parties may themselves set and access their own tracking technologies when you visit our Services and they may have access to information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites or applications when you use the Service. Their use of such tracking technologies is not in our control and is subject to their own privacy policies. \n\nV. YOUR AD CHOICES\nAdvertising enables us to provide the rich content for which Services on the Turner Network are known, and to provide much of this content free of cost to our Users. Thus, we strive to provide you with ads that are relevant to you and for products you may want.\n\nHowever, we also offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based advertisements and the choices available to you, please visit our Ad Choices  page which has general information about certain companies that place these advertisements. You may also find more information about entities involved in online advertising and additional choices you may make through the Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\") at the NAI Service, and the Digital Advertising Alliance (the \"DAA\") at the DAA consumer choice Service. Turner is a participant in the online industry's self-regulatory program administered by the DAA and has agreed to adhere to the DAA's principles applicable to interest-based ads.\n\nThe tools provided on the page, as well as the DAA opt-out page and the NAI opt-out page are provided by third parties, not Turner. Turner does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools. When using a mobile application you may receive tailored in-application advertisements. Depending on your device, you may be able to reset your mobile device's advertising identifier at any time by accessing the privacy settings on your mobile device. In addition, each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact (or review the applicable privacy web page of) the applicable platform operator.\n\nVI. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY\n\n1. Linked Services\nSome of the Services contain links to or integrations with other services such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other media services and platforms whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult these other services' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.\n\n2. International Transfer\nThis Service is governed by and operated in accordance with US law. If you are located outside of the US, you use this Service at your own risk. Turner is a company that operates globally so it is necessary to transfer your Information internationally. In particular, your Information will be transferred to and processed in the United States where many of our central databases operate. By using this Service, you acknowledge that the data protection and other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may provide a less comprehensive or protective standard of protection than those in your country, and consent to your Information being collected, processed and transferred as set forth in this Privacy Policy and US law.\n\n3. Data Security\nWe have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the Information we collect online. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the Information that we collect and store.\n\nAlthough we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of Information, we cannot assure you that Information will never be disclosed, altered or destroyed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.\n\n4. How You Can Access or Correct Information\nAccess to certain personal Information that is collected from our Services and that we maintain may be available to you. For example, if you created a password-protected account within our Service, you can access that account to review certain Information you provided. You may also send an e-mail or letter to the following e-mail or street address requesting access to or correction of your personal Information. Please include your registration information for such service such as first name, last name and e-mail address in the request. We may ask you to provide additional information for identity verification purposes, or to verify that you are in possession of an applicable email account.\n\nE-MAIL ADMINISTRATION\nTURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC.\nATTENTION: PRIVACY POLICY COORDINATOR\nONE CNN CENTER, 13 NORTH\nATLANTA, GA 30303\nEMAIL: WMPRIVACY@WARNERMEDIAGROUP.COM\n\n5.

It’s very, very easy to stream games live, and if you didn’t catch the game, they do have the condensed version of the game and highlights to watch to keep yourself up to date. There’s also game previews for upcoming games, loads of stats, articles, and videos about a variety of March Madness topics, and just a really streamlined and convenient user experience overall. My one request is for the ability to keep the live stream of the game going after you exit the app, as is possible when I stream with the ESPN or NBA apps. If this had that, it would be perfect. One that I always make sure to download the second week of March for every edition of the tourney.","title":"Incredibly well-designed app","userName":"hhoag03"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7834757772","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-09-23T00:19:05Z","rating":2,"review":"I’d like to start this by saying this app is super convenient and useful during the ncaa basketball tournament. I would rate it 5 stars expect for one huge flaw. When a game finishes, the app is designed so that it gives you menu of other games to chose from to watch next. This seems convenient except it does this WHILE THE GAME YOU ARE WATCHING IS NOT FINISHED. So let’s say you’re watching the end of a very close game, there’s 20 seconds on the game clock, and the ball was just passed in. The clock starts ticking and … opp, the app kicks you out of the game and here are some other games you can watch. This is super annoying and takes away from all of the good things this app has to offer because this “feature” happens at the most important point of a game ,and you can’t turn it off or do anytime about it other than try to get back to the game you were watching as quickly as possible. Hopefully this can be changed, but until that happens, 2 star rating from me.","title":"App is very useful but has one HUGE flaw","userName":"wsgirard"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7121052717","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-03-19T17:55:08Z","rating":2,"review":"As a product manager, the best thing about this app is how it makes me feel about myself and my prior work as a point of comparison. \n\nBoth the decisions and execution driving the user experience this year scream mismanagement and a fundamental misunderstanding of industry standards and best practices. \n\nThere is no PIP functionality, despite it essentially being a freebie via the operating system. Users are also unable to pause game video. I can only assume both of these decisions were made to force users to watch more preroll, which is required every time the feed is stopped as a result of the app being put in the background. \n\nThe feed is in chronological order, so the oldest post is at the top. Users are never brought to the bottom of the feed, where they would find the most recent and more relevant content. The top and bottom posts in the feed are semi-obscured by some sort of vignette for... reasons? \n\nThere is no multi view option, despite this being arguably the most relevant event in the world for such a feature to exist. \n\nEven the player control UI - something as simple as the design for active and inactive states on closed captions - is horribly implemented. \n\nI feel bad for the teams who worked on this and were either clearly not given the time and tools to succeed, or were in way over their heads. \n\nIt’s a serviceable app, but in no way is this a product that values the user’s experience.","title":"A laughably poor experience","userName":"Some Other Product Owner"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7180589759","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-04-03T23:26:37Z","rating":5,"review":"In years past I swore I would never use the app again. I used it again this year because it came down to my last and only option for viewing the March madness. I still don’t understand the “your time has expired”. It seemed each device had its own time limit. After exhausting the living room tv and the bedroom tv I was left with my phone. I started watching the Baylor game early. It was before your app emblem appeared over my cbs icon. I turned off at half time. When I tried to get back on, not allowed. I was livid. One last option was to try your MM app again.

It's equally bad on my iPad Pro and iPhone 6S.\n\nThe app constantly crashes, constantly asks me to log in with to cable provider, even after I just did and got a success message, constantly freezes and constantly gives me loading issues which only seem to be resolved by uninstalling the app and re-downloading it from the App Store. Even then, that only resolves it maybe half the time. I’ve even it had it freeze up on the AppleTV and require a reinstall. \n\nI’m done with it at this point. I really hope the dev team gets their act together for next year.

You can’t watch every single game live, there’s 16 on in each of the first two days! Don’t you think people would want to go back and watch the other games? Especially if they work since it starts on two work days? It was the best feature and you removed it, boggles the mind. You should have added a score hiding toggle, not removed replays argh. Also having to watch a 15s ad every time you turn it on or change the game is annoying, especially when it crashes a lot when casting it to your appletv. Speaking of which it crashes 5 times every time I try to restart it while casting to the appletv.

Unfortunately, the app has taken some serious steps backwards. \n\nIt's no longer possible to see other score while a game is playing.

That feature is gone, which is a serious usability flaw. \n\nAlso, the scores and time left on the clock are frequently wrong on the main dashboard.\n\n2019 update:\n\nPretty solid overall. The ability to watch multiple games is slick, although it’s difficult to see which game you are switching to because the UI is a bit ambiguous.

So if there are multiple close games going on, it’s virtually impossible to quickly flip between them because you get the dumb ad every time. I saw NMSU and Auburn were within 1 point with 1 second left so I tried to switch to watch the ending. I missed it because I had to sit through a 30 second ad before it would show the live action.
