        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The latest update adds file attachments as major feature and a ton of smaller improvements!<br />You can now import files into your notes, the sync (CloudKit) has been improved, so your notes will be automatically merged in case of a sync conflict (when you edit a note from different devices), and more.<br /><br />FILE ATTACHMENTS — Add PDFs, presentations, and other files to your notes<br /><br />Drag &amp; drop any file into your note to embed it (such as a PDF). In the background, NotePlan will copy the file side-by-side with your note into an attachments folder and sync it across your devices. Add a PDF from your Mac, open it on your iPad to annotate with your Apple Pencil, and review the same file later on the go on your iPhone.<br /><br />IMPROVEMENTS<br /><br />This version of NotePlan also brings a couple of improvements:<br /><br />- Sync conflicts will be auto-merged if possible. If you edit a note from two devices, you have seen a red bar at the bottom to choose which one to keep. Now NotePlan will attempt to merge your notes automatically, if possible, so you don&#39;t have to pick a version anymore.<br />- Use the new `&gt;today` tag to permanently schedule a task to today until you complete it.<br />- CMD+K improved, so that you can add Markdown links faster. Copy a link from anywhere, select a word in NotePlan, and hit CMD+K to create a titled link.<br />- Typing and full-text search performance improved (and CMD+Shift+F shortcut added to open Search).<br />- Various minor sync issues were fixed and a &quot;CloudKit Console&quot; window was added in the advanced sync preferences to help you keep your database clean and consistent.<br /><br />Have fun and be productive with this new NotePlan update!<br />If you are happy with the app, please rate it, or even leave a review. This is a great way to support us, indie developers. Thanks a lot!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi there,<br /><br />I recently downloaded this app and fell in love with it at first sight(or use). I have used all other productivity apps out there across both iOS and Mac, but nothing comes close to the features Noteplan provides. The ability to access and modify my notes, tasks and calendar, all in one place, cross-platform is beyond amazing! That is the foremost thing that sets Noteplan apart, in fact, a class apart from all other apps out there. They all seem to be missing one or the other feature and the closest anything has come to meeting that benchmark, is this app. I saw that people were raving about it on Twitter as well and I couldn&#39;t help but get this. I am on a free trial right now and I am set to get the paid version of the app in Sep -The fact that I am leaving a review at this stage is only indicative of the HUGE potential and brilliance of this app. I observed also, like one of the other reviewers here, that the development team is quite responsive and I really appreciate the fact. As a fan of this app, you can expect your team hearing from me with inputs and feedback along the way - I want to see this app get better and the best! There is so much potential here and I am in love with this! Thank you for your and the work of your team to make this possible! 🙏🏻😀<br /><br />Anubha</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I used to manage my notes and tasks in another app whose name I won&#39;t mention here. It served a lot of my needs well, but over the years, I started to need a bit more. However, and in spite of the fact that they had a full team together, the pace of their development began moving at a glacial pace. After looking around a bit, I found Noteplan and I&#39;m in love. It comes with all of the features I believe should be standard in a note-taking app this day and age, and it even adds some exciting features I didn&#39;t even know would be helpful. What&#39;s most important, however, is that Noteplan&#39;s developer seems to take his app very seriously and has singlehandedly added new and impressive features to Noteplan on a consistent basis. I&#39;m glad to be on Team Noteplan and I look forward to what comes next!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>*Responding the the Developer Response:*<br />I want to report back that i am in fact using the CloudKit sync option on across devices. I also happen to notice the that mentioned sync issue is also raised by others in your app review by zverhope and gop1334. I am not sure if this is your way to deflect the problem or a way to buy time in resolving the limitation and app maturity. I second my voice with the other reviewers on fixing the aforementioned issues. Thanks for the response and looking forward to a real fix!<br /><br />*Original Review*<br />Poor technical implementation, the app in itself shows great concept on the productivity category. However, a lot of the sync, sort feature are actually rather basic. Mentioning a few of the annoying parts of the application, among them: new notes is only in a single designated location, inconsistency sync between devices bringing old folder structures and notes back, lag from url pasting and other daily qualm. From an expectation point of view for a productivity app, this app just make it annoying for the user once they invested time into it.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Thanks for the review!<br /><br />Sorry that you are not satisfied with the features. There are tons of feature requests and I need to prioritize which are the most popular ones. The sort functionality and choosing where to store your files are unfortunately not at the top of the list. Regarding sync, it sounds you have used the Dropbox option which is in &quot;beta&quot; and I kept it only in the app due to requests. Please use CloudKit or iCloud Drive. They don&#39;t have such problems.<br /><br />Pasting an URL has a lag because it needs to load the website and find the &quot;title&quot; attribute. You can alternatively turn it off in the preferences under &quot;markdown&quot; and the lag is gone.<br /><br />Do you have any other points I could address? I encourage you to reach out to hello@noteplan.co or share your troubles in our Subreddit (reddit.com/r/noteplanapp).<br />Best,<br />Eduard</p>

latest update adds file attachments as major feature and a ton of smaller improvements!\nYou can now import files into your notes, the sync (CloudKit) has been improved, so your notes will be automatically merged in case of a sync conflict (when you edit a note from different devices), and more.\n\nFILE ATTACHMENTS — Add PDFs, presentations, and other files to your notes\n\nDrag \u0026 drop any file into your note to embed it (such as a PDF). In the background, NotePlan will copy the file side-by-side with your note into an attachments folder and sync it across your devices. Add a PDF from your Mac, open it on your iPad to annotate with your Apple Pencil, and review the same file later on the go on your iPhone.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\nThis version of NotePlan also brings a couple of improvements:\n\n- Sync conflicts will be auto-merged if possible. If you edit a note from two devices, you have seen a red bar at the bottom to choose which one to keep. Now NotePlan will attempt to merge your notes automatically, if possible, so you don't have to pick a version anymore.\n- Use the new `\u003etoday` tag to permanently schedule a task to today until you complete it.\n- CMD+K improved, so that you can add Markdown links faster. Copy a link from anywhere, select a word in NotePlan, and hit CMD+K to create a titled link.\n- Typing and full-text search performance improved (and CMD+Shift+F shortcut added to open Search).\n- Various minor sync issues were fixed and a \"CloudKit Console\" window was added in the advanced sync preferences to help you keep your database clean and consistent.\n\nHave fun and be productive with this new NotePlan update!\nIf you are happy with the app, please rate it, or even leave a review. This is a great way to support us, indie developers. Thanks a lot!","releaseDate":"2021-11-04"},{"versionDisplay":"3.1","releaseNotes":"The latest update to NotePlan adds 2 new major features: heading links and revisions. You can now easily link to parts of another note with heading links. And revisions gives you a complete history of every note, ready to restore with a tap or click. \n\nHEADING LINKS — Link directly to note headings\n\nNotePlan now lets you link directly to any heading in another note. Just start typing [[ to bring up a note, and then type # to add a link to any of the note's headings. For example, linking to [[Acme Project#Timeline]] lets you jump directly to the Timeline heading inside the ACME Project note. Heading links are great to move faster and link to specific sections in longer notes without having to scroll through the entire document.\n\nREVISIONS — Time Machine for your notes\n\nNever worry about losing a thought, part of a note, or an entire note with NotePlan's new revisions feature. Every word, every edit, every change: NotePlan has your back. Simply open up revisions and go back (or forward) to any version of your note. Revisions get you peace of mind in case you overwrite something, accidentally delete something, or just if you want to retrace your thoughts. All you need to do is open up revisions, select the version you want and restore it. What's more: the revisions feature is super-smart, too. It keeps every change of a note, then switches to daily versions, then weekly. The result? Detailed changes and quick recovery when you need it.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\nThis version of NotePlan also brings a couple of improvements:\n\n- Ability check off scheduled and canceled tasks in the Review/Search views\n- Linking to relative file paths in Markdown (if you store files like PDFs in NotePlans file structure, they will be also displayed and synced).\n- Improved command bar search for searches with multiple words\n- Fix for editing the week view (cursor jumped to the end).\n- Additional API options available (DataStore.saveJSON/loadJSON for persisting settings or other data)\n\nHave fun and be productive with this new NotePlan update!\nIf you are happy with the app, please rate it, or even leave a review.

Add a PDF from your Mac, open it on your iPad to annotate with your Apple Pencil, and review the same file later on the go on your iPhone.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\nThis version of NotePlan also brings a couple of improvements:\n\n- Sync conflicts will be auto-merged if possible. If you edit a note from two devices, you have seen a red bar at the bottom to choose which one to keep.

Thanks a lot!","releaseDate":"2021-11-04"},{"versionDisplay":"3.1","releaseNotes":"The latest update to NotePlan adds 2 new major features: heading links and revisions. You can now easily link to parts of another note with heading links. And revisions gives you a complete history of every note, ready to restore with a tap or click. This version has also been optimized to work on iOS 15 and iPadOS 15.\n\nHEADING LINKS — Link directly to note headings\n\nNotePlan now lets you link directly to any heading in another note. Just start typing [[ to bring up a note, and then type # to add a link to any of the note's headings. For example, linking to [[Acme Project#Timeline]] lets you jump directly to the Timeline heading inside the ACME Project note. Heading links are great to move faster and link to specific sections in longer notes without having to scroll through the entire document.\n\nREVISIONS — Time Machine for your notes\n\nNever worry about losing a thought, part of a note, or an entire note with NotePlan's new revisions feature. Every word, every edit, every change: NotePlan has your back. Simply open up revisions and go back (or forward) to any version of your note. Revisions get you peace of mind in case you overwrite something, accidentally delete something, or just if you want to retrace your thoughts. All you need to do is open up revisions, select the version you want and restore it. What's more: the revisions feature is super-smart, too. It keeps every change of a note, then switches to daily versions, then weekly. The result? Detailed changes and quick recovery when you need it.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\nThis version of NotePlan also brings a couple of improvements:\n\n- Ability check off scheduled and canceled tasks in the Review/Search views\n- Linking to relative file paths in Markdown (if you store files like PDFs in NotePlans file structure, they will be also displayed and synced).\n- Better link handling options on iOS (context menu pops up when you tap on a link in edit mode).\n- Improved command bar search for searches with multiple words\n- Fix for iOS share sheet issues.\n- Additional API options available (DataStore.saveJSON/loadJSON for persisting settings or other data)\n\nHave fun and be productive with this new NotePlan update!\nIf you are happy with the app, please rate it, or even leave a review.

I have used all other productivity apps out there across both iOS and Mac, but nothing comes close to the features Noteplan provides. The ability to access and modify my notes, tasks and calendar, all in one place, cross-platform is beyond amazing! That is the foremost thing that sets Noteplan apart, in fact, a class apart from all other apps out there. They all seem to be missing one or the other feature and the closest anything has come to meeting that benchmark, is this app. I saw that people were raving about it on Twitter as well and I couldn't help but get this. I am on a free trial right now and I am set to get the paid version of the app in Sep -The fact that I am leaving a review at this stage is only indicative of the HUGE potential and brilliance of this app. I observed also, like one of the other reviewers here, that the development team is quite responsive and I really appreciate the fact. As a fan of this app, you can expect your team hearing from me with inputs and feedback along the way - I want to see this app get better and the best! There is so much potential here and I am in love with this!

It comes with all of the features I believe should be standard in a note-taking app this day and age, and it even adds some exciting features I didn't even know would be helpful. What's most important, however, is that Noteplan's developer seems to take his app very seriously and has singlehandedly added new and impressive features to Noteplan on a consistent basis. I'm glad to be on Team Noteplan and I look forward to what comes next!","title":"Great app with an exciting future!","userName":"M@son_"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7110683731","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-03-16T21:13:21Z","developerResponse":{"id":21686859,"body":"Thanks for the review!\n\nSorry that you are not satisfied with the features.

However, a lot of the sync, sort feature are actually rather basic. Mentioning a few of the annoying parts of the application, among them: new notes is only in a single designated location, inconsistency sync between devices bringing old folder structures and notes back, lag from url pasting and other daily qualm.

Noteplan checks all of the boxes: Excellent note taking, Excellent project/task management, and Simple/intuitive workflow. The one area I would like to see improved is notes export -- Noteplan supports Markdown text export (and quasi-formatted PDF if you print a note from MacOS) which is adequate, but I would like to see Rich Text and fully formatted PDF export.

Just start typing [[ to bring up a note, and then type # to add a link to any of the note's headings. For example, linking to [[Acme Project#Timeline]] lets you jump directly to the Timeline heading inside the ACME Project note. Heading links are great to move faster and link to specific sections in longer notes without having to scroll through the entire document.\n\nREVISIONS — Time Machine for your notes\n\nNever worry about losing a thought, part of a note, or an entire note with NotePlan's new revisions feature. Every word, every edit, every change: NotePlan has your back. Simply open up revisions and go back (or forward) to any version of your note.

All you need to do is open up revisions, select the version you want and restore it. What's more: the revisions feature is super-smart, too.

In the background, NotePlan will copy the file side-by-side with your note into an attachments folder (saved locally) and sync it across your devices. Add a PDF from your Mac, open it on your iPad to annotate with your Apple Pencil, and review the same file later on the go on your iPhone.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\nThis version of NotePlan also brings a couple of improvements:\n\n- Sync conflicts will be auto-merged if possible. If you edit a note from two devices, you have seen a red bar at the bottom to choose which one to keep. Now NotePlan will attempt to merge your notes automatically, if possible, so you don't have to pick a version anymore.\n- Editor resizing fixed on iPad in multi-tasking mode (opening NotePlan side-by-side with other apps) \n- Drag \u0026 drop one or multiple files, images, text, and links from other apps into NotePlan.\n- Use the new `\u003etoday` tag to permanently schedule a task to today until you complete it.\n- CMD+K improved, so that you can add Markdown links faster.

Thanks a lot!","releaseDate":"2021-11-04"},{"versionDisplay":"3.1","releaseNotes":"The latest update to NotePlan adds 2 new major features: heading links and revisions. You can now easily link to parts of another note with heading links. And revisions gives you a complete history of every note, ready to restore with a tap or click. This version has also been optimized to work on iOS 15 and iPadOS 15.\n\nHEADING LINKS — Link directly to note headings\n\nNotePlan now lets you link directly to any heading in another note. Just start typing [[ to bring up a note, and then type # to add a link to any of the note's headings. For example, linking to [[Acme Project#Timeline]] lets you jump directly to the Timeline heading inside the ACME Project note. Heading links are great to move faster and link to specific sections in longer notes without having to scroll through the entire document.\n\nREVISIONS — Time Machine for your notes\n\nNever worry about losing a thought, part of a note, or an entire note with NotePlan's new revisions feature. Every word, every edit, every change: NotePlan has your back. Simply open up revisions and go back (or forward) to any version of your note. Revisions get you peace of mind in case you overwrite something, accidentally delete something, or just if you want to retrace your thoughts. All you need to do is open up revisions, select the version you want and restore it. What's more: the revisions feature is super-smart, too. It keeps every change of a note, then switches to daily versions, then weekly. The result? Detailed changes and quick recovery when you need it.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\nThis version of NotePlan also brings a couple of improvements:\n\n- Ability check off scheduled and canceled tasks in the Review/Search views\n- Linking to relative file paths in Markdown (if you store files like PDFs in NotePlans file structure, they will be also displayed and synced).\n- Better link handling options on iOS (context menu pops up when you tap on a link in edit mode).\n- Improved command bar search for searches with multiple words\n- Fix for iOS share sheet issues.\n- Additional API options available (DataStore.saveJSON/loadJSON for persisting settings or other data)\n\nHave fun and be productive with this new NotePlan update!\nIf you are happy with the app, please rate it, or even leave a review.
