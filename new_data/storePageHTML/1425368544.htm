From starting your favorite timers with one click to managing your projects and tags, Timery brings you easy time tracking with Toggl.\n\nTimery works with your free or paid Toggl account but is developed independently of Toggl.\n\nThe full features of Timery:\n\nSaved Timers\nSave your most used Toggl timers and start them with one tap.\n\nTime Entries\nEdit &amp; delete your past week’s time entries, start duplicates, and manually add new entries.\n\nTime Entry Suggestions\nSelect from suggested saved timers &amp; recent time entries when starting or editing time entries.\n\nReports Overview\nSee your time tracked today and this week with configurable filters and grouping options.\n\nSummary Report\nShow project summary reports of your time tracked beyond today and this week.\n\nManage Projects &amp; More\nEdit &amp; delete your Toggl projects, tasks, &amp; tags and add new ones.\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nShow sections, start time entries, edit current time entry, and more.\n\nMenu Bar Item\nSee your current time entry in the menu bar with quick access to editing it, opening the app, and starting saved timers.\n\nCustomizable Widgets\nStart saved timers, check your current time entry, and check time tracked today, this week, &amp; beyond.\n\nCustomizable Appearance\nShow tag names, change the app theme color, customize dark mode, and more.\n\nMuch more is planned for the future.\n\nA few notes on how the app works:\n• Timery requires a Toggl account. If you don’t already have an account, sign up in the app or with Toggl.\n• Timery requires an internet connection to perform tasks.\n• Saved timers sync with iCloud and are available on all your devices signed in with your Apple ID.\n\nTimery is free to use on a limited basis: save up to four timers, manage the four latest time entries today (the rest are read-only), and edit the current time entry. With a monthly or yearly subscription (which includes a two-week free trial), join the Timery Club and unlock all the app’s functionality. You’ll also be helping support the app and future development, and I greatly appreciate that!\n\nHappy time tracking!\n\n———\n\nTimery has been featured on MacStories, AppStories, Connected, Cortex, and Upgrade and was selected as Best New App for the 2019 MacStories Selects awards and Best Newcomer iOS App for the 2019 Upgradies awards.\n\nFederico Viticci on MacStories:\n\n“What sets Timery apart from other time tracking utilities is the unique combination of developer Hribar’s understanding of the needs of Toggl users and his embrace of modern iOS and iPadOS technologies. Timery isn’t just a more customizable Toggl client with advanced features […]; it’s also an exemplary iOS and iPadOS citizen that showcases what great iOS and iPad apps should offer. […]\n\n“[…It’s] not often that a new app manages to go beyond mere professional intrigue and actually change the way we get work done. Timery is one such app”.\n\nMyke Hurley on Upgrade:\n\n“It’s been an application in really great consistent development throughout the entire year. The developer, Joe, does a wonderful job of integrating feedback from users and advancing the application in a bunch of ways.”\n\n“It is an application that I use all day every day. When I am working, Timery is running. It’s absolutely fantastic, and I love it.”\n\n———\n\nSubscription Details:\n• Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase or after the free trial period if offered.\n• Your subscription will automatically renew unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

From starting your favorite timers with one click to managing your projects and tags, Timery brings you easy time tracking with Toggl.<br /><br />Timery works with your free or paid Toggl account but is developed independently of Toggl.<br /><br />The full features of Timery:<br /><br />Saved Timers<br />Save your most used Toggl timers and start them with one tap.<br /><br />Time Entries<br />Edit &amp; delete your past week’s time entries, start duplicates, and manually add new entries.<br /><br />Time Entry Suggestions<br />Select from suggested saved timers &amp; recent time entries when starting or editing time entries.<br /><br />Reports Overview<br />See your time tracked today and this week with configurable filters and grouping options.<br /><br />Summary Report<br />Show project summary reports of your time tracked beyond today and this week.<br /><br />Manage Projects &amp; More<br />Edit &amp; delete your Toggl projects, tasks, &amp; tags and add new ones.<br /><br />Keyboard Shortcuts<br />Show sections, start time entries, edit current time entry, and more.<br /><br />Menu Bar Item<br />See your current time entry in the menu bar with quick access to editing it, opening the app, and starting saved timers.<br /><br />Customizable Widgets<br />Start saved timers, check your current time entry, and check time tracked today, this week, &amp; beyond.<br /><br />Customizable Appearance<br />Show tag names, change the app theme color, customize dark mode, and more.<br /><br />Much more is planned for the future.<br /><br />A few notes on how the app works:<br />• Timery requires a Toggl account. If you don’t already have an account, sign up in the app or with Toggl.<br />• Timery requires an internet connection to perform tasks.<br />• Saved timers sync with iCloud and are available on all your devices signed in with your Apple ID.<br /><br />Timery is free to use on a limited basis: save up to four timers, manage the four latest time entries today (the rest are read-only), and edit the current time entry. With a monthly or yearly subscription (which includes a two-week free trial), join the Timery Club and unlock all the app’s functionality. You’ll also be helping support the app and future development, and I greatly appreciate that!<br /><br />Happy time tracking!<br /><br />———<br /><br />Timery has been featured on MacStories, AppStories, Connected, Cortex, and Upgrade and was selected as Best New App for the 2019 MacStories Selects awards and Best Newcomer iOS App for the 2019 Upgradies awards.<br /><br />Federico Viticci on MacStories:<br /><br />“What sets Timery apart from other time tracking utilities is the unique combination of developer Hribar’s understanding of the needs of Toggl users and his embrace of modern iOS and iPadOS technologies. Timery isn’t just a more customizable Toggl client with advanced features […]; it’s also an exemplary iOS and iPadOS citizen that showcases what great iOS and iPad apps should offer. […]<br /><br />“[…It’s] not often that a new app manages to go beyond mere professional intrigue and actually change the way we get work done. Timery is one such app”.<br /><br />Myke Hurley on Upgrade:<br /><br />“It’s been an application in really great consistent development throughout the entire year. The developer, Joe, does a wonderful job of integrating feedback from users and advancing the application in a bunch of ways.”<br /><br />“It is an application that I use all day every day. When I am working, Timery is running. It’s absolutely fantastic, and I love it.”<br /><br />———<br /><br />Subscription Details:<br />• Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase or after the free trial period if offered.<br />• Your subscription will automatically renew unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I hope you’re finding the new reports in the app useful! This update brings improved support for Monterey and Shortcuts(!), recent time entries in the menu bar item, a tag customization option, and some fixes.<br /><br />Shortcuts<br />All the Shortcuts actions on iPhone and iPad are now on Mac in Monterey! Start &amp; stop time entries, check your current time entry, check time tracked, and more.<br /><br />Menu Bar Recent Time Entries<br />The menu bar item has a new menu of recent time entries. Like with the saved timers menu, select one to start a new time entry with its details.<br /><br />Show Tag Names<br />There’s an additional Show Tag Names option in Preferences to show tag names in menus and in Shortcuts output. For example, if you only use projects and tags for your time entries, this will allow showing items like “Project - Tag” in menus rather than just showing the project name.<br /><br />Add to Shortcuts<br />From Preferences on Monterey, quickly add and edit Shortcuts actions for starting saved timers and checking tracked time like on iPhone and iPad.<br /><br />Fixes:<br />• Improved editing of start and stop times with arrow keys on Monterey. Left and Right move between hour and minute, and Up and Down change the values.<br />• When editing a project, clients can be selected again when not on a paid Toggl plan.<br />• Summary Reports properly exclude projects if set to in the report configuration.<br />• When selecting clients in report configurations, the last-selected client is the only one that will have a checkmark.<br /><br />—————<br /><br />Thank you for using and supporting Timery! If you have a question or suggestion or run into an issue, please email me at support@timeryapp.com.<br /><br />Happy time tracking!<br />– Joe<br /><br />—————<br /><br />What was new in Timery 1.3:<br /><br />This update is all about reports! New reports in the app, new reports in widgets, and updated reports in Shortcuts.<br /><br />New in the app:<br />• See an overview of time tracked today and this week in Reports Overview<br />• Show project time tracked beyond today and this week in Summary Report<br />• Save report configurations to quickly return to them later<br /><br />New in widgets and Shortcuts:<br />• See an overview of time tracked today and this week with the large Time Tracked widget<br />• View time tracked up to the past year with the Summary Report widget<br />• See graphs of reported items in Shortcuts actions</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Timery is far superior to Toggl’s own iOS app, which is buggy, poorly designed, and barely useful. I was using the API via Shortcuts in lieu of their app. Luckily now we have Timery! Beautiful design, indie developed, by someone who is trustworthy and cares about making a solid product. Timery strives to support all of the important Toggl features like clients and tasks whiting projects, and I think the developer plans to add reporting at some point, and at the same time, Timery also strives to support the latest modern features and design principles in iOS like Dark Mode, theme and icon variations, card interface, robust and ever-expanding Shortcuts support, and more. Whether you use the paid version of Toggl or the free level, this app is still awesome, and well worth the subscription!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Finally! Timery for Mac! I have been waiting for this for so long... Toggl just can&#39;t build a Mac app to save itself. Timery&#39;s Mac app has a lot of the same great features of its iOS companion and is fast, efficient, and a breeze to work with. There are some things that I have noticed so far that I would like to see improved: 1) tabbing through the &#39;Edit Time Entry&#39; only makes four stops. It would be great if it would continue past the description and into the time area. 2) tabbing through the time editing area (after manually clicking on the Start time, for example) only has one stop for the hours and minutes, so you must use the arrow keys on your keyboard to get to the minutes. It would be handy to have reminders to start a timer if you are in the middle of your workday and don&#39;t have a timer running. It would also be great to have a reports or chart to show daily and weekly summary by project, client, etc.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I use time tracking less as a work tool (I work regular hours on a more-or-less fixed schedule, so I know how much time I spend working) and more as a personal self-awareness check, logging things like time spent socializing and cleaning the house.<br /><br />Toggl was always kind of interesting, but it’s interface and integrations were always lackluster—until Timery.<br /><br />The biggest factor to how effectively I track my time is ease of use: if I have to spend multiple minutes starting a timer every time I want to track something it rapidly becomes a wasted effort.<br /><br />Timery is the solution for this problem: it’s saved timers and widget features enable near-instantaneous tracking, and with practically zero effort.<br /><br />It’s supposed to be getting an update soon for Shortcuts integrations (the developer is pretty open about the progress on Twitter) and I intend to spend a fair amount out time configuring that system, but even in its current state it is hands down the best app for time tracking I’ve found.</p>

hope you’re finding the new reports in the app useful! This update brings improved support for Monterey and Shortcuts(!), recent time entries in the menu bar item, a tag customization option, and some fixes.\n\nShortcuts\nAll the Shortcuts actions on iPhone and iPad are now on Mac in Monterey! Start \u0026 stop time entries, check your current time entry, check time tracked, and more.\n\nMenu Bar Recent Time Entries\nThe menu bar item has a new menu of recent time entries. Like with the saved timers menu, select one to start a new time entry with its details.\n\nShow Tag Names\nThere’s an additional Show Tag Names option in Preferences to show tag names in menus and in Shortcuts output. For example, if you only use projects and tags for your time entries, this will allow showing items like “Project - Tag” in menus rather than just showing the project name.\n\nAdd to Shortcuts\nFrom Preferences on Monterey, quickly add and edit Shortcuts actions for starting saved timers and checking tracked time like on iPhone and iPad.\n\nFixes:\n• Improved editing of start and stop times with arrow keys on Monterey. Left and Right move between hour and minute, and Up and Down change the values.\n• When editing a project, clients can be selected again when not on a paid Toggl plan.\n• Summary Reports properly exclude projects if set to in the report configuration.\n• When selecting clients in report configurations, the last-selected client is the only one that will have a checkmark.\n\n—————\n\nThank you for using and supporting Timery!

Top-level items (projects, tags, etc.) and days can be selected to show time tracked for the item or day.\n\nSummary Report\nShow project summary reports of your time tracked beyond today and this week with configurable filters and parameters. Top-level items also can be selected to show time tracked for the item. There are fewer filtering and grouping options than Reports Overview because of how the Toggl API works, but it can report on up to one year of time.\n\nSaved Report Configurations\nReports Overview and Summary Report configurations can be saved to quickly return to later. Saved configurations sync with iCloud, so they’re available on all your devices.\n\n*Widget Updates*\n\nTime Tracked Widget Update\nThe large size now by default shows today and this week with options to show extended details or this week by day instead.\n\nSummary Report Widget\nShow project summary reports of your time tracked up to the past year with configurable filters.\n\nFilter Tasks\nThe Time Tracked widget has a new parameter Filter Tasks. If the project filter is on, only tasks from any filtered projects are available to select from.\n\nOpen to Reports\nThe Widget Opens parameter has options to open to Reports Overview and Summary Report.\n\nSaved Timers Fix\nWhen configuring the Saved Timers widget, an up-to-date list of available timers should more reliably be shown.\n\n—————\n\nThank you for using and supporting Timery!

This update brings your current time entry to the menu bar plus some other small improvements and fixes.\n\nWhat’s new:\n• Menu bar item\n• New ways to start a new current time entry\n• Edit and stop the current time entry more easily\n• Many fixes\n\nRead on for more details!\n\nMenu Bar Item\nShow the current time entry in the menu bar with quick access to editing it, starting a new current time entry, starting saved timers, and showing the app. (Timery Club required)\n\nMenu Bar Item Customization\nThere’s a new Preferences menu for the menu bar item to enable it and customize its appearance. Choose if Timery should show in the menu bar as well as if the item should show the current time entry duration, include seconds in the duration, dim when there’s no current time entry, and show the current time entry’s project color in the icon. (Timery Club required)\n\nNew Current Time Entry\n• The app icon’s menu in the Dock has a new option “New Current Time Entry”. Selecting it will open the app to start a new time entry.\n• In all three widgets, the Widget Opens parameter has a new option “New Current Time Entry”. When selected, clicking the widget will open the app to start a new time entry.\n\nEdit and Stop the Current Time Entry\nWhen editing the current time entry, clicking the Stop button will now stop it and apply any edits you made. Previously, to edit and stop the current time entry, you had to update it first and then stop it.\n\nQuick Access to Current Time Entry Actions\nWhen editing a time entry, click and hold the Start cell to set the start time to the last stop time (if time has been tracked today). And click and hold the Duration cell to round the duration (Timery Club required to round). These perform the same actions as clicking the cell and then clicking the revealed buttons. Just more quickly.\n\nMany Fixes\n• When starting or editing time entries, the description field is more reliably selected if set to auto-select.\n• Switching workspaces from the sidebar should no longer occasionally crash the app.\n• When editing a time entry’s start or stop times on systems not on 24-hour time, pressing Tab (in addition to Left Arrow and Right Arrow keys) will jump between hour, minute, and AM/PM fields.\n• The app better handles checking for the current time entry when returning to the app after it was behind other windows or hidden.\n• In alerts, cancel buttons are now on the left where they’re supposed to be.\n• Many views and controls throughout the app have VoiceOver and Voice Control improvements.\n\n—————\n\nAs always, thank you for using and supporting Timery!

Timery isn’t just a more customizable Toggl client with advanced features […]; it’s also an exemplary iOS and iPadOS citizen that showcases what great iOS and iPad apps should offer. […]\n\n“[…It’s] not often that a new app manages to go beyond mere professional intrigue and actually change the way we get work done. Timery is one such app”.\n\nMyke Hurley on Upgrade:\n\n“It’s been an application in really great consistent development throughout the entire year. The developer, Joe, does a wonderful job of integrating feedback from users and advancing the application in a bunch of ways.”\n\n“It is an application that I use all day every day. When I am working, Timery is running.

By default, editing the duration will adjust the stop time, but you can switch to adjusting the start time instead. There’s also a new settings option to change the default.\n\nSet the Default Tab\nFor Timery Club members, there’s a new settings option to set the default tab to Saved Timers or Time Entries. When Timery starts up, the selected tab will be shown.\n\nArchived Projects\nFor some users, archived projects were showing up in the projects lists in the app. This should be fixed now.\n\nCopy Time Entry Details\nWhen editing time entries in the app, the section to copy details from now shows saved timers first. If you prefer it to show recent time entries first like it previously did, there’s a new settings option to change the default.\n\nTeam Times\nThe Check Project Time Tracked, Check Time Logged, Check Timer Time Tracked, and Get Time Entries shortcuts will no longer automatically include tracked time from team members and will only report on your time. If you want to include times from team members, each shortcut has a new parameter to include team time.\n\nTime Tracked Widget Updates:\n\nCurrent Time Entry\nThere’s a new option to show the current time entry in medium and large sizes. If toggled on, the current time entry will replace the reported duration which will instead appear above the list of items. Tap it to open the app to the current time entry.\n\nCustom Headers\nThere’s a new option to provide a custom heading label to appear above the reported duration. The widget will automatically append “today” or “this week” to the custom heading, but there’s an option to turn that off.\n\nCustom Bar Colors\nIf the widget is not reporting on projects or filtered projects, you can customize the color of the bars. By default the bars will match the app’s theme color, but they can be changed to use one of the preset Toggl colors or a custom color.\n\nDay Labels\nFor some users, if the widget is set to report on this week and is grouped by days, the times were correct but the day labels were off by a day. This should be fixed now.\n\nMore Tweaks\nIn the medium size, graph bars are now slightly wider so they fill the space more.

When reporting on time tracked this week, the widget will break down the times for each day of the week so you can compare day to day how much time you’ve tracked.\n\nGraph Improvements\nBar graphs in the Time Tracked widget are improved so the bars are less vertically squished especially when the times reported are spread fairly evenly across multiple items.\n\nWidget App Launching\nAll three widgets have a new parameter to customize where in the app the widget will open when selecting it. The options are: App (if you previously had the app open, it will reopen to that spot), Saved Timers, Time Entries, and Current Time Entry.\n\nTime Tracked Sorting\nThe Check Total Time Tracked shortcut and the Check Project Time Tracked shortcut have a new parameter to sort the reported items in the presented shortcut UI alphabetically (like they are currently) or by duration.\n\nA note on the old Timery widget: If you’d like to use the old widget, it’s still part of the app and hasn’t been removed.

This update brings you some app and widget additions and fixes as well as some more customization options!\n\nWhat’s new:\n• Widgets should update more reliably from the app and shortcuts\n• All three widgets have more appearance options including custom colors\n• The Saved Timers widget has a compact mode option\n• Improvements when editing time entry start and stop times\n• And more!\n\nRead on for more details!\n\nWidget Updating\nThe widgets (especially the Current Time Entry widget) should update more reliably from the app and shortcuts. iOS puts limits on widget updating, so widgets still may not update immediately depending on what iOS decides. You can still pull-to-refresh in the app to try to update the widgets.\n\nWidget Appearance Options\nAll three widgets have more appearance options. In addition to System, Always Light, and Always Dark, you can choose from Always Black (where the widget will always have a black background), Black in Dark Mode (where the widget will be white in light mode and black in dark mode), and Custom Color.\n\nIf you select Custom Color, two more parameters will appear: Custom Hex Color to input a hex code (with or without the ‘#’) and Text Color to select black or white for the widget’s text.\n\nSaved Timers Compact Mode\nIn the Saved Timers widget, there’s an option for compact mode. This will show two more timers in the medium size and four more timers in the large size.\n\nEditing Start and Stop Times\nOn iOS 14, when editing time entry start and stop times, the time picker is now above the calendar for quicker time editing.\n\nUse Wheels to Edit Times\nAlso for devices on iOS 14, there’s a new option in Settings to use the old wheels to edit times instead of the new date picker.\n\nMore Goodies!\n• Details in the Time Tracked widget can now also be grouped by clients.\n• When editing the current time entry in the app, the stop and delete buttons take up a single row instead of two rows (unless the device is using an accessibility text size).\n• As in the Saved Timers and Time Entries tabs, you can now pull-to-refresh in Settings to refresh the app’s data.\n\nA note on the old Timery widget: If you’d like to use the old widget, it’s still part of the app and hasn’t been removed.

A new time entry will start and automatically set its start time to whenever the last stop time today was. Also, long press the current time entry to open the app to edit it.\n\nTime Entry Edit View\nThe current time entry can be stopped and its stop time set in the view. And the current or a logged time entry can be deleted in the view.\n\nCurrent Time Entry Sync\nStart, stop, or update the current time entry on one device in the Timery app, widget, or Shortcuts actions, and it will sync to your other devices.\n\nImproved iPadOS Pointer Support\nWhen hovering over cells in the Saved Timers and Time Entries tabs and in the widget, the icons will get slightly larger. Also, the start/stop button above the tab bar and other buttons in the app have magnetism.\n\nMore Duration Formats\nThe app, widget, and shortcuts support Toggl’s Decimal duration formatting (0.79 h) and Classic duration formatting (47:06 min) in addition to the default Improved formatting (0:47:06). Also, there’s a new Settings submenu to change the duration format.\n\nHome Screen Icons and Theme Colors\nTheme colors, Home screen icons, and Settings icons are updated to match the recently tweaked Toggl project colors. For Timery Club members, there are 12 new Home screen icons (6 regular and 6 inverted) so all Toggl project colors are represented. Also, the app’s theme color can be set independently of the selected app icon.\n\nAnd More!\n• In Settings \u003e Projects, projects can be archived in addition to edited and deleted.\n• In the Saved Timers and Time Entries tabs, Command-R is a new keyboard shortcut to refresh the app’s data.\n• In the Time Entries tab, selecting grouped time entries expands and collapses them instead of editing them as a group. Swipe or activate the context menus to edit them.\n\nShortcuts updates:\n\nProject Names\nProject parameters and filters in shortcuts better handle projects with colons and parentheses in their names. In project name strings, Timery uses colons to denote project tasks and parentheses to denote clients. A project name with either in it would previously cause an error.\n\nSaved Timers\nGet Saved Timers is a new shortcut that returns the list of saved timers.\n\nProject and Tag Filters\nProject filters allow selecting multiple projects to either include or exclude in the items returned. Tag filters have renamed and reordered options to match.\n\nRound Durations\nShortcuts that display and output durations have an option to round durations.\n\nUpdate Time Entry\nUpdate Current Time Entry has become Update Time Entry with an option to update the current time entry (the default) or a specific time entry using its ID (which can now be retrieved from Get Time Entries).\n\nAnd More!\n• Add Project is a new shortcut with parameters for workspace, client, billable status, and color.\n• The Check Total Time Tracked shortcut can now filter project, description, tags, and billable status.\n\n—————\n\nAs always, thank you for using Timery!

This update has some small features and changes to improve your time-tracking experience with Timery!\n\nHere’s a quick glance at what’s new:\n• Group similar time entries (Timery Club required)\n• Check today’s project times with Siri (Timery Club required)\n• Include the current time entry when checking today’s times with Siri\n• No more “[No Project]”\n• Hide saved timers in the widget\n\nHere’s a detailed look at what’s new:\n\nGroup Similar Time Entries\nFor Timery Club subscribers, there is a new option in the Settings tab to group similar time entries. If multiple time entries in a day have the same project, description, tags, and billable status, they’ll be grouped together with a number on the left indicating how many there are. Tap the number to expand the group and see the individual time entries.\n\nCheck Today’s Project Times with Siri\nAlso for Timery Club subscribers, there are new Siri Shortcuts in Settings \u003e Check Today’s Times to check the time tracked today for any of your projects. In the menu, you can now switch between your saved timers and your projects to set up shortcuts and voice phrases.\n\nInclude the Current Time Entry When Checking Today’s Times\nThere is a new option in Settings \u003e Check Today’s Times to include the duration of the current time entry in the times reported by those Siri Shortcuts. If toggled off, only completed, logged time entries will count toward the reported times (the current functionality).\n\nNo More “[No Project]”\nSaved timers and time entries without a project no longer say “[No Project]” and will instead have blank project labels. Saved timers and time entries without a project, description, and tags will now say “[No Details]”.\n\nRemove Projects from Saved Timers and Time Entries\nWhen adding or editing a saved timer or time entry, you can now select “No Project”. If you’ve previously set a project for a timer and want to remove it, you now can.\n\nHide Saved Timers in the Widget\nWhen adding or editing a saved timer, you can now choose whether or not to show the timer in the widget.\n\nBug Fixes\n• Fixed tapping Add Timer in the widget sometimes crashing the app at launch. (Thanks, Sean!)\n• If you logged in to Toggl with your email address \u0026 password and you change either outside Timery, you’ll now be prompted to log out and log back in to get the app working again.\n\nMany of these things were requests and suggestions from users like you, so if there’s something you wish Timery did or did better, please let me know at support@timeryapp.com! Please also let me know if you have a question or run into an issue.\n\nIf you’re enjoying Timery and have a moment, please rate and review it on the App Store (there’s a new link in Settings to take you directly to Timery on the App Store). Your support is appreciated and helps the app get discovered!\n\nAnd finally, thank you for using Timery.

I really appreciate all the support. I hope you’ve been enjoying tracking your time with Timery!\n\nThis update incorporates some of the great feedback I’ve received (thank you!). It’s a small update but a mighty one if you depend on clients and billable time entries or if you want a faster way to find things.\n\nHere’s a quick glance at what’s new:\n• Clients: See your projects’ clients in your saved timers and time entries and manage them in Timery’s settings.\n• Billable Support: See and set the billable status for your saved timers and time entries.\n• Search: Find the saved timer, time entry, project, or tag you’re looking for more easily by searching for it.\n• Design Tweaks: Description text in saved timers and time entries is slightly more prominent for better legibility.\n• Bug Fixes: There are some of those too!\n\nHere’s a detailed look at what’s new:\n\nClients\nTimery now supports displaying Toggl clients throughout the app, in the widget, and in Siri shortcuts. If any of your projects have clients assigned to them, you’ll now see something like “• Client Name” after the project name.\n\nClient Management\nClients can now be assigned to or removed from projects in Settings \u003e Projects \u003e [Your Project]. And there’s a new settings menu for adding, editing, and deleting clients. (Timery Club required.)\n\nBillable Support\nA $ icon will display in saved timers and time entries that are set as billable. If you’re on a paid Toggl plan, you can now set the billable status for saved timers, time entries, and projects when adding or editing them.\n\nAuto-Billable Things\nWhen adding a new saved timer or time entry, if the project is set to billable, the saved timer or time entry will automatically be set to billable. (This won’t affect your existing saved timers, so they’ll need to be manually set as billable.)\n\nSearch Your Things\nYou can now search your saved timers and time entries by project, task, description, tag, or client. And you can start, edit, and delete saved timers and time entries from the search results.\n\nSearch Some More\nWhen adding or editing a saved timer or time entry, you can also now search your projects and tags when selecting them. And you can search them in their settings menus.\n\nDesign Tweaks\nDescription text in saved timers and time entries is slightly darker in light mode (and in the widget and Siri shortcuts) and slightly lighter in dark mode to improve legibility.\n\nMore Keyboard Shortcuts\nIf you have a time entry running, stop it with a new keyboard shortcut: Command-Option-S. Also, the new searches can be activated with a keyboard shortcut: Command-F.\n\nNew Projects and Tags for Everyone\nIf you aren’t subscribed to the Timery Club, you can now add new projects and tags when adding or editing a saved timer or time entry.\n\nBug Fixes\n• After editing a project, the projects view more reliably updates to show the change.\n• In the dark mode settings when a scheduled time picker was open, switching modes and then switching back to scheduled no longer causes a crash. (Thanks, John!)\n• When logging in, the email address field having a space at the end no longer shows as invalid. (Thanks, Clayton!)\n\nMany of these things were requests and suggestions from users like you, so if there’s something you wish Timery did or did better, please let me know at support@timeryapp.com! Please also let me know if you have a question or run into an issue.\n\nIf you’re enjoying Timery and have a moment, please rate and review it on the App Store.

From starting your favorite timers with one tap to managing your projects and tags, Timery brings you easy time tracking with Toggl.\n\nTimery works with your free or paid Toggl account but is developed independently of Toggl.\n\nThe full features of Timery:\n\nSaved Timers\nSave your most used Toggl timers and start them with one tap.\n\nTime Entries\nEdit \u0026 delete your past week’s time entries, start duplicates, and manually add new entries.\n\nTime Entry Suggestions\nSelect from suggested saved timers \u0026 recent time entries when starting or editing time entries.\n\nReports Overview\nSee your time tracked today and this week with configurable filters and grouping options.\n\nSummary Report\nShow project summary reports of your time tracked beyond today and this week.\n\nManage Projects \u0026 More\nEdit \u0026 delete your Toggl projects, tasks, \u0026 tags and add new ones.\n\nCustomizable Widgets\nStart saved timers, check your current time entry, and check time tracked today, this week, \u0026 beyond.\n\nCustomizable Appearance\nShow tag names, change the app icon \u0026 theme color, customize dark mode, and more.\n\nShortcuts Support\nStart \u0026 stop time entries, check your current time entry, check time tracked, and more.\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nShow sections, start time entries, edit current time entry, and more.\n\nMuch more is planned for the future.\n\nA few notes on how the app works:\n• Timery requires a Toggl account.

Timery strives to support all of the important Toggl features like clients and tasks whiting projects, and I think the developer plans to add reporting at some point, and at the same time, Timery also strives to support the latest modern features and design principles in iOS like Dark Mode, theme and icon variations, card interface, robust and ever-expanding Shortcuts support, and more.

Timery for Mac! I have been waiting for this for so long... Toggl just can't build a Mac app to save itself. Timery's Mac app has a lot of the same great features of its iOS companion and is fast, efficient, and a breeze to work with. There are some things that I have noticed so far that I would like to see improved: 1) tabbing through the 'Edit Time Entry' only makes four stops. It would be great if it would continue past the description and into the time area. 2) tabbing through the time editing area (after manually clicking on the Start time, for example) only has one stop for the hours and minutes, so you must use the arrow keys on your keyboard to get to the minutes. It would be handy to have reminders to start a timer if you are in the middle of your workday and don't have a timer running.

Previously, to edit and stop the current time entry, you had to update it first and then stop it.\n\nQuick Access to Current Time Entry Actions\nWhen editing a time entry, click and hold the Start cell to set the start time to the last stop time (if time has been tracked today). And click and hold the Duration cell to round the duration (Timery Club required to round). These perform the same actions as clicking the cell and then clicking the revealed buttons. Just more quickly.\n\nMany Fixes\n• When starting or editing time entries, the description field is more reliably selected if set to auto-select.\n• Switching workspaces from the sidebar should no longer occasionally crash the app.\n• When editing a time entry’s start or stop times on systems not on 24-hour time, pressing Tab (in addition to Left Arrow and Right Arrow keys) will jump between hour, minute, and AM/PM fields.\n• The app better handles checking for the current time entry when returning to the app after it was behind other windows or hidden.\n• In alerts, cancel buttons are now on the left where they’re supposed to be.\n• Many views and controls throughout the app have VoiceOver and Voice Control improvements.\n\n—————\n\nAs always, thank you for using and supporting Timery!

By default, editing the duration will adjust the stop time, but you can switch to adjusting the start time instead. There’s also a new settings option to change the default.\n\nSet the Default Tab\nFor Timery Club members, there’s a new settings option to set the default tab to Saved Timers or Time Entries. When Timery starts up, the selected tab will be shown.\n\nArchived Projects\nFor some users, archived projects were showing up in the projects lists in the app. This should be fixed now.\n\nCopy Time Entry Details\nWhen editing time entries in the app, the section to copy details from now shows saved timers first. If you prefer it to show recent time entries first like it previously did, there’s a new settings option to change the default.\n\nTeam Times\nThe Check Project Time Tracked, Check Time Logged, Check Timer Time Tracked, and Get Time Entries shortcuts will no longer automatically include tracked time from team members and will only report on your time.

The widget will automatically append “today” or “this week” to the custom heading, but there’s an option to turn that off.\n\nCustom Bar Colors\nIf the widget is not reporting on projects or filtered projects, you can customize the color of the bars. By default the bars will match the app’s theme color, but they can be changed to use one of the preset Toggl colors or a custom color.\n\nDay Labels\nFor some users, if the widget is set to report on this week and is grouped by days, the times were correct but the day labels were off by a day. This should be fixed now.\n\nMore Tweaks\nIn the medium size, graph bars are now slightly wider so they fill the space more.

You can still pull-to-refresh in the app to try to update the widgets.\n\nWidget Appearance Options\nAll three widgets have more appearance options. In addition to System, Always Light, and Always Dark, you can choose from Always Black (where the widget will always have a black background), Black in Dark Mode (where the widget will be white in light mode and black in dark mode), and Custom Color.\n\nIf you select Custom Color, two more parameters will appear: Custom Hex Color to input a hex code (with or without the ‘#’) and Text Color to select black or white for the widget’s text.\n\nSaved Timers Compact Mode\nIn the Saved Timers widget, there’s an option for compact mode. This will show two more timers in the medium size and four more timers in the large size.\n\nEditing Start and Stop Times\nOn iOS 14, when editing time entry start and stop times, the time picker is now above the calendar for quicker time editing.\n\nUse Wheels to Edit Times\nAlso for devices on iOS 14, there’s a new option in Settings to use the old wheels to edit times instead of the new date picker.\n\nMore Goodies!\n• Details in the Time Tracked widget can now also be grouped by clients.\n• When editing the current time entry in the app, the stop and delete buttons take up a single row instead of two rows (unless the device is using an accessibility text size).\n• As in the Saved Timers and Time Entries tabs, you can now pull-to-refresh in Settings to refresh the app’s data.\n\nA note on the old Timery widget: If you’d like to use the old widget, it’s still part of the app and hasn’t been removed.

Bring your Toggl setup to your Home screen with three customizable widgets for starting saved timers, viewing your current time entry, and viewing times tracked today or this week.\n\nWhat’s new:\n• Timery now requires iOS 13 or higher.\n• Three customizable iOS 14 widgets.\n• Shortcuts that report on time periods have expanded options beyond today and this week.\n• Dynamic Type is (finally) supported throughout app.\n• Icons throughout the app use SF Symbols.\n• And more!\n\nRead on for more details!\n\niOS 14 Saved Timers Widget\nStart saved timers from a customizable grid in small, medium, and large sizes. Edit the widget to choose which timers to display and whether or not to show your current time entry like the old Timery widget. Note: iOS requires the widget to open the app to start the timers.\n\niOS 14 Current Time Entry Widget\nView your current running time entry in small and medium sizes. The medium size will also show the time tracked today for that timer.\n\niOS 14 Time Tracked Widget\nView your time tracked today or this week in small, medium, and large sizes. Edit the widget to choose the time period as well as apply various filters to customize what is reported on (like a single project or client) and how it is displayed (like by project or by tag).\n\nShortcuts Time Periods\nShortcuts with time period parameters have more options beyond today and this week. The Check Total Time Tracked, Check Project Time Tracked, Check Timer Time Tracked, and Get Time Entries shortcuts can report on:\n• Today\n• Yesterday\n• This week\n• Last week\n• This month\n• Last month\n• This year\n• Last year\n• Between two dates (maximum of one year due to Toggl API limitations)\n• A specific date\n\nNote: Because of Toggl API limitations, these actions in your shortcuts could take several seconds or more depending on how much data they’re retrieving (for example reporting on an entire year). That also means they could time out in Shortcuts, so you may need to adjust the filters to report on fewer things.\n\nDynamic Type\nIf you use a text-size setting other than the default—including the larger accessibility sizes—the app will adjust accordingly.\n\nSF Symbols\nIcons throughout the app and widgets use SF Symbols to provide a consistent experience with system apps and other third-party apps.\n\nCurrent Time Entry View\nWhen editing the current time entry in the app (like when tapping the current time entry widget), there is a dedicated stop button to stop it.\n\nBillable Icons\nIn the app and widgets, if a saved timer or time entry is billable, the currency icon will show the symbol for the project’s currency if available.

Bring your Toggl setup to your Home screen with three customizable widgets for starting saved timers, viewing your current time entry, and viewing times tracked today or this week.\n\nWhat’s new:\n• Timery now requires iOS 13 or higher.\n• Three customizable iOS 14 widgets.\n• Shortcuts that report on time periods have expanded options beyond today and this week.\n• Dynamic Type is (finally) supported throughout app.\n• Icons throughout the app use SF Symbols.\n• And more!\n\nRead on for more details!\n\niOS 14 Saved Timers Widget\nStart saved timers from a customizable grid in small, medium, and large sizes. Edit the widget to choose which timers to display and whether or not to show your current time entry like the old Timery widget. Note: iOS requires the widget to open the app to start the timers.\n\niOS 14 Current Time Entry Widget\nView your current running time entry in small and medium sizes. The medium size will also show the time tracked today for that timer.\n\niOS 14 Time Tracked Widget\nView your time tracked today or this week in small, medium, and large sizes. Edit the widget to choose the time period as well as apply various filters to customize what is reported on (like a single project or client) and how it is displayed (like by project or by tag).\n\nShortcuts Time Periods\nShortcuts with time period parameters have more options beyond today and this week. The Check Total Time Tracked, Check Project Time Tracked, Check Timer Time Tracked, and Get Time Entries shortcuts can report on:\n• Today\n• Yesterday\n• This week\n• Last week\n• This month\n• Last month\n• This year\n• Last year\n• Between two dates (maximum of one year due to Toggl API limitations)\n• A specific date\n\nNote: Because of Toggl API limitations, these actions in your shortcuts could take several seconds or more depending on how much data they’re retrieving (for example reporting on an entire year). That also means they could time out in Shortcuts, so you may need to adjust the filters to report on fewer things.\n\nDynamic Type\nIf you use a text-size setting other than the default—including the larger accessibility sizes—the app will adjust accordingly.\n\nSF Symbols\nIcons throughout the app and widgets use SF Symbols to provide a consistent experience with system apps and other third-party apps.\n\nCurrent Time Entry View\nWhen editing the current time entry in the app (like when tapping the current time entry widget), there is a dedicated stop button to stop it.\n\nBillable Icons\nIn the app and widgets, if a saved timer or time entry is billable, the currency icon will show the symbol for the project’s currency if available. Otherwise, it will show the default currency for the workspace like it currently does. (Currencies not available as system icons will default to “$”.)\n\nMore Goodies\n• On iOS 14, the new date picker is used when editing the start and stop times of the current time entry or a logged entry.\n• Also on iOS 14, the output of the Get Saved Timers, Get Time Entries, and Get Projects shortcuts shows icons and tags for each item.\n• When using manual, brightness, or scheduled dark mode in the app, the light and dark colors are tweaked to match the system light and dark colors.\n\n—————\n\nAs always, thank you for using Timery!

A new time entry will start and automatically set its start time to whenever the last stop time today was. Also, long press the current time entry to open the app to edit it.\n\nTime Entry Edit View\nThe current time entry can be stopped and its stop time set in the view. And the current or a logged time entry can be deleted in the view.\n\nCurrent Time Entry Sync\nStart, stop, or update the current time entry on one device in the Timery app, widget, or Shortcuts actions, and it will sync to your other devices.\n\nImproved iPadOS Pointer Support\nWhen hovering over cells in the Saved Timers and Time Entries tabs and in the widget, the icons will get slightly larger. Also, the start/stop button above the tab bar and other buttons in the app have magnetism.\n\nMore Duration Formats\nThe app, widget, and shortcuts support Toggl’s Decimal duration formatting (0.79 h) and Classic duration formatting (47:06 min) in addition to the default Improved formatting (0:47:06). Also, there’s a new Settings submenu to change the duration format.\n\nHome Screen Icons and Theme Colors\nTheme colors, Home screen icons, and Settings icons are updated to match the recently tweaked Toggl project colors. For Timery Club members, there are 12 new Home screen icons (6 regular and 6 inverted) so all Toggl project colors are represented. Also, the app’s theme color can be set independently of the selected app icon.\n\nAnd More!\n• In Settings \u003e Projects, projects can be archived in addition to edited and deleted.\n• In the Saved Timers and Time Entries tabs, Command-R is a new keyboard shortcut to refresh the app’s data.\n• In the Time Entries tab, selecting grouped time entries expands and collapses them instead of editing them as a group. Swipe or activate the context menus to edit them.\n\nShortcuts updates:\n\nProject Names\nProject parameters and filters in shortcuts better handle projects with colons and parentheses in their names. In project name strings, Timery uses colons to denote project tasks and parentheses to denote clients. A project name with either in it would previously cause an error.\n\nSaved Timers\nGet Saved Timers is a new shortcut that returns the list of saved timers.\n\nProject and Tag Filters\nProject filters allow selecting multiple projects to either include or exclude in the items returned. Tag filters have renamed and reordered options to match.\n\nRound Durations\nShortcuts that display and output durations have an option to round durations.\n\nUpdate Time Entry\nUpdate Current Time Entry has become Update Time Entry with an option to update the current time entry (the default) or a specific time entry using its ID (which can now be retrieved from Get Time Entries).\n\nAnd More!\n• Add Project is a new shortcut with parameters for workspace, client, billable status, and color.\n• The Check Total Time Tracked shortcut can now filter project, description, tags, and billable status.\n\n—————\n\nAs always, thank you for using Timery!

(This won’t affect your existing saved timers, so they’ll need to be manually set as billable.)\n\nSearch Your Things\nYou can now search your saved timers and time entries by project, task, description, tag, or client. And you can start, edit, and delete saved timers and time entries from the search results.\n\nSearch Some More\nWhen adding or editing a saved timer or time entry, you can also now search your projects and tags when selecting them. And you can search them in their settings menus.\n\nDesign Tweaks\nDescription text in saved timers and time entries is slightly darker in light mode (and in the widget and Siri shortcuts) and slightly lighter in dark mode to improve legibility.\n\nMore Keyboard Shortcuts\nIf you have a time entry running, stop it with a new keyboard shortcut: Command-Option-S. Also, the new searches can be activated with a keyboard shortcut: Command-F.\n\nNew Projects and Tags for Everyone\nIf you aren’t subscribed to the Timery Club, you can now add new projects and tags when adding or editing a saved timer or time entry.\n\nBug Fixes\n• After editing a project, the projects view more reliably updates to show the change.\n• In the dark mode settings when a scheduled time picker was open, switching modes and then switching back to scheduled no longer causes a crash. (Thanks, John!)\n• When logging in, the email address field having a space at the end no longer shows as invalid. (Thanks, Clayton!)\n\nMany of these things were requests and suggestions from users like you, so if there’s something you wish Timery did or did better, please let me know at support@timeryapp.com!
