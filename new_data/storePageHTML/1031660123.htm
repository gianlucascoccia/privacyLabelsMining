        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have have been struggling to find energy just to complete basic everyday tasks ,  the thought of exercise  was impossible! I would wake up counting down the minutes until bedtime ! I have had multiply back , knee and other joint related surgeries over the past 20 years , struggling with physical pain  daily !  I have tried everything from vitamins , stimulates  caffeine , and spending thousands on very product  that claimed Weight loss ,give me endless energy and would love the results  it came down to either I didn’t follow the instructions or they just didn’t deliver what they promised !Being trapped inside like everyone else has taken the last of my motivation ! After seeing  the ad on tv for beach body I figured I had nothing to loose so I signed up ! I discovered after just a few work outs that the miracle quick fix industry-who manipulates , Control’s and gets rich by exploiting those desperately searching for help trapped in a cycle of disappointment! <br />The very first work out ( my only physical activity was   bowling twice a week )  it was not pretty but fun ! That day I didn’t sit down all ! I  discovered only I have the power to change my life !  I have never felt like this in my 52 years of life ! I will update each week of my progress ! Thank you</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been using this app for over a year and it’s been working great until now. I hate going to the gym and I’d much rather work out at home with the kiddos nearby so this app is great for getting a good workout in the comfort of your own home. I always stream the workouts to my tv via chrome cast but after the IOS 12 update, the chrome cast icon is non existent. There is a message from the support center on the troubleshooting page stating that they are aware of this issue and they give a suggested tip for a temporary fix (which doesn’t work for me) and they assure us that they are working quickly to resolve the issue with a permanent fix. My concern is that we’ve been waiting for over a month now and I have not been able to use this app at all since then. I have tried everything as far as the suggested tip of turning off Bluetooth and even WiFi and closing the app, uninstalling the app and reinstalling and I check for updates on the daily. I have already paid for my annual subscription but have lost over a months worth of workouts due to this issue with no word on when it will actually be resolved. Now I’m just throwing money down the drain. Somebody needs to work faster to fix the issue or start comping the subscriptions for iPhone users.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love it.. Although I don&#39;t want to lift lol.. Has never really been my thing.. I don&#39;t discriminate against anyone who wants to. But .. I do love working out and this gives an option to work out at home and also if you choose to use other program materials offered in the Beachbody LLC program. But ..I think someone is in the app store editing Beachbody LLC end terms. Along with some others only bc I can tell by the change in font.. The style and I remember what it said before and it wasn&#39;t that. It was/ is positive so I just thought I should let someone know. It is the right thing to do . But overall still a 5 js. I love it. And will continue to use it regardless of anything. More ppl should try to be healthier all the way around. This program is a form of therapy for many. So keep being you . And .. Working out for me has never been an issue. And every person is differnet and works out on different levels..programs etc. I just enjoy cardio... And I eat pretty healthy and anyone could eat better etc.. I just choose to cook or eat what my body craves. I&#39;ve been told.. That your body craves what it&#39;s lacking. So I don&#39;t use supplements etc . They aren&#39;t for everyone unless consulted with a physcian first. But I am always open to trying new things.</p>

Cookies are small text files placed on your computer or mobile device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie is a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device and can contain other information as well. We use cookies on our websites and Beachbody Services to recognize your device, store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide internet-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze our products, and perform and fulfill other legitimate purposes.\n\nCertain Beachbody Services and websites contain electronic images known as pixel tags (also called web beacons or gifs) that we use to help deliver and recognize cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and gather usage and performance data. We also include pixels in our emails to tell if you open and act on them.\n\nBeachbody mobile apps use device IDs to help conduct analytics and deliver ads. Apple and Android mobile devices each generate a mobile advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in much the same way that cookies are used on websites.\n\n-\tThird Party Cookies and Pixel Tags: Our websites and services include pixel tags and cookies and mobiles IDs from third parties. In some cases, a third party uses cookies and pixel tags or mobile IDs to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, third parties use cookies and pixel tags or mobile IDs to track interaction with and the effectiveness of content (such as videos, news content) and ads. When your browser connects to a third partyís web server to retrieve content or pixel tags, that third party is able to set or read its own cookies on your device and may use those cookies to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services using those cookies.\n\nBelow is a chart that identifies the third party advertising and analytics providers we use on some or all of the Beachbody Services, such as TeamBeachbody.com, Beachbody.com, BeachbodyOnDemand.com, and other sites and apps. The chart also notes their purposes for using your cookie data, and ways you can opt-out of their use of your cookies.

We share personal information we collect as described below: \n\n-\tThird-Party Service Providers: We disclose any of the categories of personal information described in this policy to third party companies and individuals for business purposes performed on our behalf to better serve you. For example, we use third parties to help us make our products and services available to you, fulfill orders you may have placed, process credit card payments, provide customer service, ship postal mail, deliver your packages, conduct market research or information analysis, manage promotions, and contact you in connection with various Beachbody Services. In these instances, we may need to provide your information to these third parties for such purposes. \n\n-\tCustomers and the Team Beachbody Community: To maximize the benefits of our products and services, we assign an independent Team Beachbody Coach (a ìCoachî) to all customers who purchase a product through Beachbody/Team Beachbody or who consent to be contacted by a Coach. Your assigned Coach is available to assist you in understanding and using the products you ordered, and help give you the motivation you need to help you achieve your fitness goals. To help you both get in contact and for other business purposes, we may disclose to your assigned Coach certain information you provided during your purchase process, such as your contact information (your name, address, phone number, email address) and transaction history and order information. Your Coach may contact you to offer support, and provide general information and marketing materials. Please note that Beachbody will never provide your assigned Coach your credit or debit card information or, if you provided it, your Social Security number/Social Insurance number. Customers may opt-out of further sharing their information with Coaches by visiting their Preference Center which is accessible through links at the bottom of e-mails you receive from Beachbody. If you joined Beachbody LIVE!, we may provide certain basic information to the Master Trainer assigned to train you during your training, such as your name, email address and phone number. \n\n-\tCoaches and the Team Beachbody Community: Individuals who join the Team Beachbody community as a Coach are joining a business to help others succeed with their health and wellness goals. As part of that mission, Coaches will have access to certain information of certain other Coaches to help them engage and collaborate with other Coaches, and grow their business. This includes information such as name, address, phone number, e-mail address, transaction history and order information, and Coach-related sales, performance and team information. Coaches may opt-out of further sharing information with their upline Coaches by visiting their Preference Center which is accessible through links at the bottom of e-mails you receive from Beachbody.\n\n-\tAffiliates and Subsidiaries; Beachbody Partners; Third Party Offers: Beachbody may share your personal information with its affiliates, subsidiaries and parent companies. Beachbody occasionally partners with third parties to learn more about our customers so we can service you better or offer products or services that we feel may be useful to you (\"Beachbody Partners\"). In such case, we may disclose to a Beachbody Partner certain information, such as your contact information (name, email address, phone number, billing or shipping address) and purchase history. If you request information from a Beachbody Partner, we may disclose additional information such as your email address, phone number and other contact information, so the Beachbody Partner can provide you with the information you requested. If you purchased a product or service from a Beachbody Partner, we will also disclose your payment information, such as credit card information so they can complete your purchase. We may disclose aggregated, de-identified information to Beachbody Partners: (i) so the Beachbody Partners can provide you with advertisements tailored to your interests; (ii) for statistical analysis, research, and demographic profiling purposes; and (iii) to support our business and improve our mission to help our customers achieve their health and wellness goals.\n\n-\tProtection of Beachbody and Others: We may share your information, including personally identifiable information, in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Beachbody, or the legal rights of our customers, Coaches, business partners, employees, agents, and contractors; (ii) protect the safety and security of our customers, Coaches or members of the public, including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) detect and protect against fraud and identity theft or to conduct risk management; (iv) comply with laws, legal process, or legal requests from any governmental or regulatory body; or (v) to enforce or apply our website Terms and Conditions and/or other agreements.\n\n-\tDe-identified Data Disclosures: We may also disclose non-identifying transaction information to third parties for accounting, record keeping and other purposes. We may also disclose aggregated, de-identified user data or non-personal information with business partners, advertisers, and others.\n\nWhat About Third-Party and Advertisersí Services?  \n\nAt various points and pages on our websites or mobile applications, you may be able to access or utilize services offered by or in conjunction with third parties. This includes services in connection with third-party \"social media\" and other sites that would allow personal information to be transferred to such third parties (for example, Facebook Connect), Coaches, and others. \n\nThese third parties have separate data collection and privacy practices independent from ours, so please review their privacy policies to understand your rights. For this reason, Beachbody cannot be responsible for their policies or activities. Please contact those third parties directly if you have questions about their privacy practices. \n\nHow Secure is Information About Me? \n\nBeachbody has implemented and uses reasonable security measures designed to help prevent the loss and unauthorized access of your information. Despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or to be absolutely secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or our online services. You can help protect your personal information by not reusing any passwords you use in connection with your Beachbody accounts. If you suspect a website or mobile application is pretending to be that of Beachbodyís (also known as ìspoofingî), do not enter any personal information, but please let us know by emailing CyberSecurity@Beachbody.com. Personal information may be accessed by persons within our organization, or our third party service providers, who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated above, or such other purposes as may be permitted or required by the applicable law. Personal Information we collect is maintained in the United States.   \n\nWhat Happens to My Information if Beachbody is Sold to or Merges With Another Company? \n\nAs we continue to develop and grow our business or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, we might sell one or more of our assets, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Customer information may also be disclosed in connection with due diligence or in preparation of a potential sale or investment.\n\nWhat if a Coach Who Has my Information Sells or Transfers Her Coach Business to Another Coach?\n\nTeam Beachbody Coaches have the ability to sell or transfer their Coach business to another Coach. In such case, certain information pertaining to their customers and other Coaches in their organization, such as name, phone number, e-mail address and transaction history, may be transferred to the Coach purchasing the business. Customers always have the ability to opt-out of sharing information with their assigned Coach as described above. \n\nUsers Based Outside of the USA; Transfer of Personal Information \n\nLike most websites and businesses, Beachbodyís websites may be accessed by an international audience. By visiting our websites, using our applications, and/or providing us with any data, you agree we may collect, process, use, and store your personal information as discussed herein, outside your resident jurisdiction (such as the U.S. or Canada). Our Beachbody Partners and third party service providers may also be located outside of your jurisdiction. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions. Please note that U.S. law and those of other countries where your information may be stored and processed may offer different levels of protection for your information than your home country. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that such personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n\nHow Can I Access or Update My Information?\n\nWe want to be sure your personal information is kept accurate and complete, and for this reason we ask that you inform us in the event of any changes to your information. If you provided your information directly to Beachbody, you may access or update certain personal information by calling our Customer Service at (800) 804-4333. When calling Customer Service, please have your email address and order information available. If you want to update information with your account, please visit the ìHelpî section within your Team Beachbody or Beachbody On Demand account for more information. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to your request to access or update your information. Please note that certain access may be subject to a fee.  \n\nYour Privacy Choices: Opt-Out \n-\tMarketing: We offer you various ways to opt-out of receiving certain communications from us. If you would like to opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us or your assigned Team Beachbody Coach, you may click the ìUnsubscribeî link found at the bottom of Beachbody marketing emails that we send and follow the easy instructions to opt-out, or you may click the ìPreferencesî links to update your email settings.

Your continued business relationship with us, or use of any of our Beachbody Services after the changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of any changes, both with regard to information we have previously collected from you and information we may collect from you in the future. \n\nNotices to California Residents \n\nYour California Privacy Rights - California Consumer Privacy Act (ìCCPAî)\n\nIf you are a California resident and the processing of personal information about you is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (ìCCPAî), beginning January 2020 you have certain rights with respect to that information.

We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate it will be clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.\n\nIf you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contacting Beachbody” heading below.\n\nChanges to This Privacy Notice\nWe may update this Privacy Notice from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments.

We also collect information through the use of other, similar technologies, such as \"pixel tags\" on our websites and in e-mail messages we may send to you which may be placed by us or a third party with whom we partner. “Pixels”, also known as \"Web beacons,\" are tiny graphic files or code snippets, not visible to the human eye, that can be included in HTML-encoded e-mail messages and web pages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail programme, the recipient's computer or device will communicate with our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with the recipient's e-mail address, the date and time the recipient viewed the e-mail message, the fact that the recipient's e-mail client is capable of receiving HTML-encoded e-mail, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag may also see or read cookies. Beachbody may use pixel tags in order to measure and understand traffic better, improve site performance, track visitor behaviour to improve user experience, and for tracking promotional and marketing campaign response, among others. You can disable the pixel tag feature by changing the settings on your e-mail client to prevent the automatic downloading of images, changing your browser settings to omit images, disabling Javascript, or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.\n\nDo You Use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?\nOur websites may also use so-called \"Flash Cookies\" (also known as Local Shared Objects or \"LSOs\") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.\n\nIf you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to \"information\" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).\n\nPlease note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.\n\nDo You Serve Targeted Advertising?\nWe also work with third parties that use tracking technologies on our websites in order to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These third party partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your hard drive. Advertisers and third party advertising partners may use third party cookies in order to collect information about you, which may include how many times you have seen their ads or whether you have interacted with an ad. They may also use third party cookies to provide you with interest-based or behavioural advertising. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide this information.\n\nHow Can I Control Cookies?\nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or reject cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our websites, however your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be severely restricted.\n\n    Browser Controls: Most major web browsers provide users with the option to accept or reject cookies. Opting out relies on information in the unique cookies placed on your web browser by our partners, so if you delete cookies, use a different device, or change web browsers, you may need to opt out again.  Please note that if you use your browser settings to block all cookies you may not be able to access parts of our or others' websites. The “Help” feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its developer. Since cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you may not be able to utilize certain critical features on our websites, such as adding items to your shopping cart, proceeding to checkout, or using essential features or services that require you to sign in.\n    Disabling Most Targeting or Behaviour Advertising Cookies: If you would like to disable advertising cookies which remember your browsing habits and display relevant advertising when you use our websites or any Beachbody Services, or to more generally understand your options, please visit http://www.youronlinechoices.com or the Network Advertising Initiative at www.networkadvertising.org. If you choose to turn off these cookies, you will still be served with advertisements on the Internet, but it may not be tailored to your interests. Whilst many companies involved in using advertising cookies and serving online behavioural advertising appear at the links above, not all do, so please remember that even if you choose to turn off cookies used by all of the companies listed, you may still receive some advertising cookies and some tailored advertisements from other companies.  \n    Targeted Advertising; Do Not Track Signals: We may customize content and advertisements for our products and services on our websites or mobile applications in order to make the content and advertising as informative and useful to you as possible. We do this by using information that you provide to us or we obtain through tracking technologies. To prevent this, some web browsers offer a “Do Not Track” signal that is a HTTP header field indicating your preference regarding tracking or cross-site user tracking. Like many other websites and online services, we do not currently alter our practices when we receive Do Not Track signals as there is no consensus among industry participants as to what \"Do Not Track\" means in this context. To find out more about \"Do Not Track,\" you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com/.\n\nHow Often Will You Update This Cookie Statement?\nWe may update this Cookie Notice from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.

Cookies are small text files placed on your computer or mobile device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie is a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device and can contain other information as well. We use cookies on our websites and Beachbody Services to recognize your device, store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide internet-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze our products, and perform and fulfill other legitimate purposes.\n\nCertain Beachbody Services and websites contain electronic images known as pixel tags (also called web beacons or gifs) that we use to help deliver and recognize cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and gather usage and performance data. We also include pixels in our emails to tell if you open and act on them.\n\nBeachbody mobile apps use device IDs to help conduct analytics and deliver ads. Apple and Android mobile devices each generate a mobile advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in much the same way that cookies are used on websites.\n\n-\tThird Party Cookies and Pixel Tags: Our websites and services include pixel tags and cookies and mobiles IDs from third parties. In some cases, a third party uses cookies and pixel tags or mobile IDs to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, third parties use cookies and pixel tags or mobile IDs to track interaction with and the effectiveness of content (such as videos, news content) and ads. When your browser connects to a third partyís web server to retrieve content or pixel tags, that third party is able to set or read its own cookies on your device and may use those cookies to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services using those cookies.\n\nBelow is a chart that identifies the third party advertising and analytics providers we use on some or all of the Beachbody Services, such as TeamBeachbody.com, Beachbody.com, BeachbodyOnDemand.com, and other sites and apps. The chart also notes their purposes for using your cookie data, and ways you can opt-out of their use of your cookies.

If you prefer, you can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.\n\n-\tPixel Tag Controls: You can disable pixel tags in emails by changing the settings on your email client to prevent the automatic downloading of images.\n\n-\tMobile Ad ID controls: Each operating system provides options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising ID.\n\n-\tDo Not Track Signals: Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.

Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above. To find out more about \"Do Not Track,\" you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com/.\n\nDoes Beachbody Share the Information and Data it Receives?\n\nWe value the trust our customers place in us to safeguard their personal information. We share personal information we collect as described below: \n\n-\tThird-Party Service Providers: We disclose any of the categories of personal information described in this policy to third party companies and individuals for business purposes performed on our behalf to better serve you. For example, we use third parties to help us make our products and services available to you, fulfill orders you may have placed, process credit card payments, provide customer service, ship postal mail, deliver your packages, conduct market research or information analysis, manage promotions, and contact you in connection with various Beachbody Services. In these instances, we may need to provide your information to these third parties for such purposes. \n\n-\tCustomers and the Team Beachbody Community: To maximize the benefits of our products and services, we assign an independent Team Beachbody Coach (a ìCoachî) to all customers who purchase a product through Beachbody/Team Beachbody or who consent to be contacted by a Coach. Your assigned Coach is available to assist you in understanding and using the products you ordered, and help give you the motivation you need to help you achieve your fitness goals. To help you both get in contact and for other business purposes, we may disclose to your assigned Coach certain information you provided during your purchase process, such as your contact information (your name, address, phone number, email address) and transaction history and order information. Your Coach may contact you to offer support, and provide general information and marketing materials. Please note that Beachbody will never provide your assigned Coach your credit or debit card information or, if you provided it, your Social Security number/Social Insurance number. Customers may opt-out of further sharing their information with Coaches by visiting their Preference Center which is accessible through links at the bottom of e-mails you receive from Beachbody. If you joined Beachbody LIVE!, we may provide certain basic information to the Master Trainer assigned to train you during your training, such as your name, email address and phone number. \n\n-\tCoaches and the Team Beachbody Community: Individuals who join the Team Beachbody community as a Coach are joining a business to help others succeed with their health and wellness goals. As part of that mission, Coaches will have access to certain information of certain other Coaches to help them engage and collaborate with other Coaches, and grow their business. This includes information such as name, address, phone number, e-mail address, transaction history and order information, and Coach-related sales, performance and team information. Coaches may opt-out of further sharing information with their upline Coaches by visiting their Preference Center which is accessible through links at the bottom of e-mails you receive from Beachbody.\n\n-\tAffiliates and Subsidiaries; Beachbody Partners; Third Party Offers: Beachbody may share your personal information with its affiliates, subsidiaries and parent companies. Beachbody occasionally partners with third parties to learn more about our customers so we can service you better or offer products or services that we feel may be useful to you (\"Beachbody Partners\"). In such case, we may disclose to a Beachbody Partner certain information, such as your contact information (name, email address, phone number, billing or shipping address) and purchase history. If you request information from a Beachbody Partner, we may disclose additional information such as your email address, phone number and other contact information, so the Beachbody Partner can provide you with the information you requested. If you purchased a product or service from a Beachbody Partner, we will also disclose your payment information, such as credit card information so they can complete your purchase. We may disclose aggregated, de-identified information to Beachbody Partners: (i) so the Beachbody Partners can provide you with advertisements tailored to your interests; (ii) for statistical analysis, research, and demographic profiling purposes; and (iii) to support our business and improve our mission to help our customers achieve their health and wellness goals.\n\n-\tProtection of Beachbody and Others: We may share your information, including personally identifiable information, in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Beachbody, or the legal rights of our customers, Coaches, business partners, employees, agents, and contractors; (ii) protect the safety and security of our customers, Coaches or members of the public, including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) detect and protect against fraud and identity theft or to conduct risk management; (iv) comply with laws, legal process, or legal requests from any governmental or regulatory body; or (v) to enforce or apply our website Terms and Conditions and/or other agreements.\n\n-\tDe-identified Data Disclosures: We may also disclose non-identifying transaction information to third parties for accounting, record keeping and other purposes. We may also disclose aggregated, de-identified user data or non-personal information with business partners, advertisers, and others.\n\nWhat About Third-Party and Advertisersí Services?  \n\nAt various points and pages on our websites or mobile applications, you may be able to access or utilize services offered by or in conjunction with third parties. This includes services in connection with third-party \"social media\" and other sites that would allow personal information to be transferred to such third parties (for example, Facebook Connect), Coaches, and others. \n\nThese third parties have separate data collection and privacy practices independent from ours, so please review their privacy policies to understand your rights. For this reason, Beachbody cannot be responsible for their policies or activities. Please contact those third parties directly if you have questions about their privacy practices. \n\nHow Secure is Information About Me? \n\nBeachbody has implemented and uses reasonable security measures designed to help prevent the loss and unauthorized access of your information. Despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or to be absolutely secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or our online services. You can help protect your personal information by not reusing any passwords you use in connection with your Beachbody accounts. If you suspect a website or mobile application is pretending to be that of Beachbodyís (also known as ìspoofingî), do not enter any personal information, but please let us know by emailing CyberSecurity@Beachbody.com. Personal information may be accessed by persons within our organization, or our third party service providers, who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated above, or such other purposes as may be permitted or required by the applicable law. Personal Information we collect is maintained in the United States.   \n\nWhat Happens to My Information if Beachbody is Sold to or Merges With Another Company? \n\nAs we continue to develop and grow our business or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, we might sell one or more of our assets, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Customer information may also be disclosed in connection with due diligence or in preparation of a potential sale or investment.\n\nWhat if a Coach Who Has my Information Sells or Transfers Her Coach Business to Another Coach?\n\nTeam Beachbody Coaches have the ability to sell or transfer their Coach business to another Coach. In such case, certain information pertaining to their customers and other Coaches in their organization, such as name, phone number, e-mail address and transaction history, may be transferred to the Coach purchasing the business. Customers always have the ability to opt-out of sharing information with their assigned Coach as described above. \n\nUsers Based Outside of the USA; Transfer of Personal Information \n\nLike most websites and businesses, Beachbodyís websites may be accessed by an international audience. By visiting our websites, using our applications, and/or providing us with any data, you agree we may collect, process, use, and store your personal information as discussed herein, outside your resident jurisdiction (such as the U.S. or Canada). Our Beachbody Partners and third party service providers may also be located outside of your jurisdiction. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions. Please note that U.S. law and those of other countries where your information may be stored and processed may offer different levels of protection for your information than your home country. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that such personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n\nHow Can I Access or Update My Information?\n\nWe want to be sure your personal information is kept accurate and complete, and for this reason we ask that you inform us in the event of any changes to your information. If you provided your information directly to Beachbody, you may access or update certain personal information by calling our Customer Service at (800) 804-4333. When calling Customer Service, please have your email address and order information available.

We also collect information through the use of other, similar technologies, such as \"pixel tags\" on our websites and in e-mail messages we may send to you which may be placed by us or a third party with whom we partner. “Pixels”, also known as \"Web beacons,\" are tiny graphic files or code snippets, not visible to the human eye, that can be included in HTML-encoded e-mail messages and web pages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail programme, the recipient's computer or device will communicate with our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with the recipient's e-mail address, the date and time the recipient viewed the e-mail message, the fact that the recipient's e-mail client is capable of receiving HTML-encoded e-mail, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag may also see or read cookies. Beachbody may use pixel tags in order to measure and understand traffic better, improve site performance, track visitor behaviour to improve user experience, and for tracking promotional and marketing campaign response, among others. You can disable the pixel tag feature by changing the settings on your e-mail client to prevent the automatic downloading of images, changing your browser settings to omit images, disabling Javascript, or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.\n\nDo You Use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?\nOur websites may also use so-called \"Flash Cookies\" (also known as Local Shared Objects or \"LSOs\") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.\n\nIf you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to \"information\" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).\n\nPlease note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.\n\nDo You Serve Targeted Advertising?\nWe also work with third parties that use tracking technologies on our websites in order to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These third party partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your hard drive. Advertisers and third party advertising partners may use third party cookies in order to collect information about you, which may include how many times you have seen their ads or whether you have interacted with an ad. They may also use third party cookies to provide you with interest-based or behavioural advertising. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide this information.\n\nHow Can I Control Cookies?\nYou can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or reject cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our websites, however your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be severely restricted.\n\n    Browser Controls: Most major web browsers provide users with the option to accept or reject cookies.

Please note that if you use your browser settings to block all cookies you may not be able to access parts of our or others' websites.

I always stream the workouts to my tv via chrome cast but after the IOS 12 update, the chrome cast icon is non existent. There is a message from the support center on the troubleshooting page stating that they are aware of this issue and they give a suggested tip for a temporary fix (which doesn’t work for me) and they assure us that they are working quickly to resolve the issue with a permanent fix. My concern is that we’ve been waiting for over a month now and I have not been able to use this app at all since then. I have tried everything as far as the suggested tip of turning off Bluetooth and even WiFi and closing the app, uninstalling the app and reinstalling and I check for updates on the daily. I have already paid for my annual subscription but have lost over a months worth of workouts due to this issue with no word on when it will actually be resolved.

It’s very buggy and difficult to use. There’s no way to expand comments on posts which appear automatically truncated, and some show just the poster’s name with no content at all. The sync feature no longer logs the full name of your workout in blue and leaves space for you to write a post - the whole reason I liked sync was that the blue title text gave more detail than “logged a workout”. It was easy and intuitive to add text and a photo and log the workout. Now it’s impossible to add a longer note without first posting and then editing, and the sync feature is basically useless. It also no longer sends a notification when sync has logged your workout reminding you to post, but maybe I just haven’t found that setting yet. Settings are hard to find. Sometimes clicking the notification button just does nothing. Scrolling is broken in the group feed so that if you accidentally scroll up a giant header comes down and covers all the text. This whole update took an app I loved to use that was starting to replace Facebook for my daily social scroll, and instead made it bulky, unusable, and frustrating to do even the most basic tasks.

I liked the app so much I called during a year subscription amazing deal and they actually credited my monthly payments already paid  on to the year special making it a even better deal. I love this app it's changed my life exercise routine definitely positively improvement for me . Oh Btw I'm 57y/o  mom who Hip Hops with Shaun T  in my home every night!","title":"Cize","userName":"skateboardmom"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5933041213","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-05-11T21:11:37Z","rating":1,"review":"Ya know that excited feeling you get when you want to workout? If so, then you also know how quickly that urge can leave your body when you have to wait for technology to work properly. I downloaded this app, selected a program and was ready to get to work. I was impressed with the selection and options. The wide variety gave me hope that I wouldn’t get bored quickly. I started with the intro video for Country Heat. It was about 15 minutes long and they just show you the moves you will be using in the actual workouts. I cast the video from my iPhone to my smart TV with no issues. When the intro video ended I was ready to move into my workout but was quickly halted because now the app won’t cast. The video starts on my phone and when I press the cast button it pauses, spins and shuts off- taking me back to the list of available videos. After retrying several times and trying to cast other videos as well, I reached out to customer service via chat. They were of zero help- telling me to connect my device and tv to the same WiFi (they already are). \nI’ve got kids, I work, I've got a house to keep up with and when I am ready to exercise because I have the time to squeeze it in, it need to do it during that allotted time. That’s part of what was so appealing about this app. Bummer. I really wanted to love it.","title":"Disappointing","userName":"slm6142"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1308609495","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"Stream the #1 home fitness programs on earth,"},"isMerchandisedEnabled":false,"isMerchandisedVisibleByDefault":false,"isSubscription":true,"name":"Beachbody® On Demand","offerName":"APPLE_BODSUB_QUARTERLY","releaseDate":"2009-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","subscriptionFamilyId":"20352124","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beachbody-on-demand/id1031660123"},"relationships":{"offers":{"data":[{"id":"ember38643866","type":"offer"}]}}},{"id":"1171519586","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"Stream the #1 home fitness programs on earth, including P90X® and INSANITY®."},"isMerchandisedEnabled":false,"isMerchandisedVisibleByDefault":false,"isSubscription":true,"name":"Beachbody® On Demand","offerName":"APPLE_BODSUB_ANNUAL","releaseDate":"2009-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","subscriptionFamilyId":"20352124","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beachbody-on-demand/id1031660123"},"relationships":{"offers":{"data":[{"id":"ember38643867","type":"offer"}]}}},{"id":"906591304","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1310051177","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1435537194","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"532353287","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1475006543","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1190148494","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1445819600","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1502228408","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1015685995","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1051342211","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1252077383","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1449131406","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"423659103","type":"media/developer","attributes":{"genreNames":[],"name":"Beachbody, LLC","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/beachbody-llc/id423659103"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6013","type":"media/genre","attributes":{"name":"Health \u0026 Fitness","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/id6013","parentName":"App Store","parentId":"36"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6012","type":"media/genre","attributes":{"name":"Lifestyle","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/id6012","parentName":"App Store","parentId":"36"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1031660123-appletvos","type":"media/app-platform","attributes":{"bundleId":"com.beachbody.bod","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features122/v4/7c/cb/52/7ccb5228-d5c2-fbc7-cc10-e75bfe492267/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"062549","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"5fa4f4","textColor3":"cdd3da","textColor4":"4d8bd2"},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features123/v4/45/cc/7d/45cc7d91-7a5b-d448-fefa-e431773c5013/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"b4b9b9","textColor1":"160408","textColor2":"191423","textColor3":"35282b","textColor4":"383541"},"fullscreenBackground":{"width":4320,"height":2160,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features7/v4/f2/20/cd/f220cd94-7242-7ec9-6360-95e2003236a7/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"005da4","textColor1":"f2f6fa","textColor2":"e5eef5","textColor3":"c1d8e9","textColor4":"b7d1e5"},"contentLogo":{"width":2400,"height":390,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features62/v4/65/93/15/65931570-212b-caba-de90-5583cd382725/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"c5c5c5","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"9d9d9d"},"brandLogo":{"width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features114/v4/6b/ab/a2/6baba2df-8f08-6e4f-7207-3b3d2c311a91/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor4":"b7b7b7"},"contentLogoTrimmed":{"width":1785,"height":324,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features113/v4/c0/a1/1e/c0a11e20-3473-b318-80ab-ad7b857ce320/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"181818","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"464646"}},"editorialNotes":{"tagline":"PiYo, P90X, and other intense workouts"},"hasInAppPurchases":true,"hasMessagesExtension":false,"isAppleWatchSupported":false,"isGameCenterEnabled":false,"isHiddenFromSpringboard":false,"isSiriSupported":false,"releaseDate":"2015-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","requiresGameController":false,"subtitle":"Cardio, HIIT, Yoga, Meditation","supportsGameController":false,"supportsPassbook":false,"copyright":"© 2019 Beachbody, LLC.
