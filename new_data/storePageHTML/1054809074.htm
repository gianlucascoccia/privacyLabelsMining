        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>In this update, we have fixed a bug related to the tempo which was not remembered correctly when reopening a score. Now everything is back in order!<br /><br />We have also released the following new features in the 3.8 udpate:<br /><br />•  Discover our new Bands and Ensembles section! This section, which is aimed at schools and teachers as well as any musicians who want to play together, will eventually include all trios, quartets, quintets, sextets and larger ensembles which are already available in the Shop.<br />To access the Bands and Ensembles section, click on your instrument in the Shop (top right-hand corner), and scroll down to the bottom, where you will find the “Bands and Ensembles” section. In this section, you can easily see the different instruments available in each ensemble piece: you can then choose your instrument part. Each musician can download their own part. Our multitrack audio system enables you to mute any instrument and adapt the Tomplay accompaniment to your needs.<br />•  The accordion is now included in the Tomplay catalogue! We will gradually expand our catalogue for this instrument but some pieces are already available.<br />•  Improved annotations: when you remove notes on the sheet music with the white pencil, you can now add text, annotations or drawings over them. In addition, you can now annotate the sheet music while the visual instrument is on the screen.<br />•  Other improvements: you can completely delete the free sheet music titles from your account ; you can filter sheet music titles by download date via the main menu.<br />•  Since the last app update, we have released more than 1500 new pieces.<br /><br />If you&#39;re still enjoying Tomplay, we would be grateful if you could leave us a review in the App Store. This helps us a lot and means we can continue to release new pieces, as well as new features.</p>

    Really takes the edge off of the pandemic shut down

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I am very glad that I discovered Tomplay. Like many people, I am an orchestra musician who has not been able to play with other people in person since the shutdown begin. Virtual performances are interesting but you’re not playing with other people at the same time. Some of these Tomplay pieces really get you almost there; especially chamber pieces like string quartets. Some of the accompaniments have very synthesized or distorted sound quality, but others sound quite good, and playing the chamber ensemble pieces with the music playing directly from my iPad, despite not being the best speakers in the world, was better than putting an earpiece in my ear because it’s more realistic to have the sound coming from outside. The first time I played a Beethoven string quartet this way, it was such a realistic experience that when I screwed up, I actually instinctively apologized to the virtual people in my iPad! And I have to say, when I got to the end of that first one, I think I got a little emotional… Ludwig would’ve been happy. It’s not perfect, but I’m giving it five stars anyways just because it fills such an important hole.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>It’s nice being able to hear the music as well as reading the notes to focus on nuances as one learns a new piece of music. Lots of features here that help the musician out, like being able to slow things down, choose what instruments one would like to hear and being able to record and annotate different fingerings and things. I’m both a cellist and classical guitarist so it’s nice to be able to find new music to work on in different areas, and the subscription is great for being able to just download new songs without even thinking about paying for song by song. <br /><br />The downside that I see is that the sound quality is compromised when slowing down a piece, but I am working off an old iPad for now until a new model arrives in a few days- keep in mind an iPad 4 may not cut the mustard here, and then of course one could also be like me and download lots of songs, play all day and still feel like there’s so much to work on!! But then again, that’s also what makes it fun, by having so much to look forward to practicing. Good times, and I’m happy I downloaded this app</p>

    Best teaching tool ever!!

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>After eight years of lessons and really trying to play the piano I had pretty much given up. I wasn’t practicing more than a half hour, two or three times a week and just wasn’t enjoying it anymore. Was all set to sell the ol&#39; piano when I chanced upon Tomplay, a couple weeks ago. Wow! Being able to play using the app&#39;s orchestral accompaniment feature makes a huge difference. You really feel like you are playing music when you use that feature. And, as for a teaching tool it can’t be beat. I love being able to #1 slow the tempo, #2 use the looping feature to play 1, 2, 3 or more measures over and over again until I get that part of the piece down pat, #3 appreciate the suggested fingering on each piece, #4 the ability to make my own notations and highlights on the music, and then print it off. And the huge music library is very impressive. Thanks to the Tomplay app I’ve gone from practicing sessions of a half hour a couple of times a week to do literally hours a day.</p>

It's back-to-school time and the opportunity to test the new features in the all new Tomplay version 3.5. We have made the following improvements in this version:\n \n• When you record, you now have the possibility of fixing the volume of your recording and the audio backing track separately using the new mixer. You will therefore get a better sound quality and will also be able to record yourself listening to the musical backing track on your headphones.\n• We have now added an on-screen instrument for the saxophone, flute and trumpet (as well as the piano, drums and guitar which are already available). This reading aid shows the on-screen instrument under the sheet music and will be particularly useful if you're not yet comfortable with reading the notes on the sheet music.\n• When you choose the parameters for hiding the scrolling cursor, this setting is now remembered so that you don't have to do it each time you open the score.\n \nWe have also corrected some minor bugs in this version.

Like many people, I am an orchestra musician who has not been able to play with other people in person since the shutdown begin. Virtual performances are interesting but you’re not playing with other people at the same time. Some of these Tomplay pieces really get you almost there; especially chamber pieces like string quartets. Some of the accompaniments have very synthesized or distorted sound quality, but others sound quite good, and playing the chamber ensemble pieces with the music playing directly from my iPad, despite not being the best speakers in the world, was better than putting an earpiece in my ear because it’s more realistic to have the sound coming from outside. The first time I played a Beethoven string quartet this way, it was such a realistic experience that when I screwed up, I actually instinctively apologized to the virtual people in my iPad! And I have to say, when I got to the end of that first one, I think I got a little emotional… Ludwig would’ve been happy. It’s not perfect, but I’m giving it five stars anyways just because it fills such an important hole.","title":"Really takes the edge off of the pandemic shut down","userName":"Matt Springer"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5218395420","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-11-30T23:05:07Z","rating":5,"review":"It’s nice being able to hear the music as well as reading the notes to focus on nuances as one learns a new piece of music. Lots of features here that help the musician out, like being able to slow things down, choose what instruments one would like to hear and being able to record and annotate different fingerings and things. I’m both a cellist and classical guitarist so it’s nice to be able to find new music to work on in different areas, and the subscription is great for being able to just download new songs without even thinking about paying for song by song. \n\nThe downside that I see is that the sound quality is compromised when slowing down a piece, but I am working off an old iPad for now until a new model arrives in a few days- keep in mind an iPad 4 may not cut the mustard here, and then of course one could also be like me and download lots of songs, play all day and still feel like there’s so much to work on!!

I wasn’t practicing more than a half hour, two or three times a week and just wasn’t enjoying it anymore. Was all set to sell the ol' piano when I chanced upon Tomplay, a couple weeks ago. Wow! Being able to play using the app's orchestral accompaniment feature makes a huge difference. You really feel like you are playing music when you use that feature. And, as for a teaching tool it can’t be beat. I love being able to #1 slow the tempo, #2 use the looping feature to play 1, 2, 3 or more measures over and over again until I get that part of the piece down pat, #3 appreciate the suggested fingering on each piece, #4 the ability to make my own notations and highlights on the music, and then print it off. And the huge music library is very impressive.

I recently downloaded the Schubert Fantasy for 4 hands. The sound quality is pretty bad and sounds like it was recorded digitally by a computer in a very lively room. There is no expression in the playing so I am using it strictly to get the rhythm right and fitting it in with the other part. I’m using a bluetooth headphones to help improve the sound but it’s still not very good. There are a few errors in how the score is played but, for the most part it is accurate.\n\nThis app is useful for me to hear how the two piano parts fit together, especially since there are polyrhythms in each part and between the two parts. I feel I have a tutor sitting next to me which is useful since I get together with my duet partner only a couple times a month.\n\nImprovements could be made in the offerings. The Schubert Fantasy is the only advanced 4 hand piece offered. It would be helpful if you could fast forward through the score rather than scrolling through lots of pages.

My main interest is classical piano and the major composers are well represented. Most scores have two different audio tracks of real (not midi) instruments to choose from. I like that you can choose between fully annotated score with fingerings and score with no annotation. One thing I wish for is a wider range of tempo adjustment. The app only allows you to slow down to 75% of the original tempo, and some of the tempos are quite brisk. I understand that slowing the tempo too much compromises the quality of the audio playback, but when I am practicing that is not as important to me as being able to play cleanly and keep good rhythm. Also I must amend my earlier review in which I complained that I was not able to restore my previous purchases and was getting no response from the developer. I'm not sure of the cause of the communication failure but they have reached out to me and the problem is resolved.

If only there was an option to have the names of the notes automatically annotated above or below the staff. I can go through and do it manually— it has annotation tools—but it is time consuming. If only for this feature I’m confident I could grow to love it even more and give it five stars.
