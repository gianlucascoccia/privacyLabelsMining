        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Really though; for me, feature set is everything. I want tools and I want them to all play together under the same umbrella/ecosystem. - W/ the addition of Focus mode just recently, we now have an app that offers most if not all of the useful task tracking features present usually only across separate apps - AND the ability to choose one, hunker down and get it done in a guided way within the app.<br /><br />I won’t dock a star for it, but I do wonder if the “Forest growing” method for focus tracking is actually more useful to the mind than more traditional pomodoro. - I recently switched from using an app like this focus mode - “stay on task, grow trees, grow a focus forest” to using a more simple pomodoro, but I’m definitely excited for ANY style of focus feature because let’s face it, that is the HARDEST part about task management. No other app has taken this into consideration to my knowledge and this is a big step I think for the standards of productivity apps.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I use to really like this app until the recent update. I can’t get my activities to go to the designated place like I use. I am on the hunt for something else. I don’t know why developers mess with a good thing! Support contacted me but I can’t put anything back like it was. Very aggravating! The new update really messed up a good thing! 🤬Until this is fixed I won’t rate this anymore than a one. To the developer - Please stop trying to contact me. I have been in touch with your people trying to see how my issue can be fixed. It should be simple. It takes forever for anyone to get back to me. I shouldn’t have to pay to have someone help me faster. If the people who help with this app responded as fast as they do to people posting reviews things would be great! I haven’t heard from anyone in two days on the issue I would like fixed. Apparently I have angered someone. I get a response every time I edit this review. These people keep sending me the same response daily. Too bad they don’t contact me to help me the issue I have! I have been waiting and all I get is this response to my review. Forget this app and get one that the developer will assist in helping if you need it. It’s March 4th and still nothing worth noting from this app developer. That should show anyone what their users mean to them. Find a better app with people that actually want to help their customers.</p>

This response hasn&#39;t been edited by us nor did we send any new replies since early February - we&#39;re not sure where the daily replies come from. Our Support Team has no backlog and all standard tickets are responded within the usual 48 hours, unless there&#39;s a complex issue which requires more time to investigate (of which we alert the user). We&#39;re not sure what the nature of this problem is since Apple only shows an alias, but if any problem is still pending please message us on FB or DM us on Twitter so we can get this sorted for you ASAP.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’m not sure what all the negative reviews are about. Well, obviously they feel they had a bad experience, I just don’t agree &amp; haven’t had their problems. I received an Echo Spot &amp; tried this app when I saw it listed as working with Alexa. I like that the app made connecting with Alexa, Calendar, Reminders, etc very easy. I have had no problems. It works with both Alexa &amp; Siri, nice clean interface, always sends my reminders, integrates my calendar no matter where I enter my event/reminder (through Alexa, Siri, Reminders, or Calendar), sub tasks works great, &amp; I haven’t had any lagging.  I love the ‘plan your day’ thing, very easy, intuitive, &amp; useful! I’m not running this on a new iPhone either, a very full 6s+, &amp; I have not bought a subscription. It does sometimes open slow, but only when I have a bunch of apps open so it is my phone not the app. This hasn’t completely replaced Things app since nothing (for me) does projects like it, but I no longer use Things for everything, pretty much just business projects. So far this has been a very useful, easy to setup, &amp; easy to use app that does what it advertises, also working with both Siri &amp; Alexa.</p>

I want tools and I want them to all play together under the same umbrella/ecosystem. - W/ the addition of Focus mode just recently, we now have an app that offers most if not all of the useful task tracking features present usually only across separate apps - AND the ability to choose one, hunker down and get it done in a guided way within the app.\n\nI won’t dock a star for it, but I do wonder if the “Forest growing” method for focus tracking is actually more useful to the mind than more traditional pomodoro. - I recently switched from using an app like this focus mode - “stay on task, grow trees, grow a focus forest” to using a more simple pomodoro, but I’m definitely excited for ANY style of focus feature because let’s face it, that is the HARDEST part about task management. No other app has taken this into consideration to my knowledge and this is a big step I think for the standards of productivity apps.","title":"The best planner by a mile @_@","userName":"Juno Gold"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2272095207","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-03-05T03:21:15Z","developerResponse":{"id":2748108,"body":"We're sorry for any issue you've experienced!

Well, obviously they feel they had a bad experience, I just don’t agree \u0026 haven’t had their problems. I received an Echo Spot \u0026 tried this app when I saw it listed as working with Alexa. I like that the app made connecting with Alexa, Calendar, Reminders, etc very easy. I have had no problems. It works with both Alexa \u0026 Siri, nice clean interface, always sends my reminders, integrates my calendar no matter where I enter my event/reminder (through Alexa, Siri, Reminders, or Calendar), sub tasks works great, \u0026 I haven’t had any lagging.  I love the ‘plan your day’ thing, very easy, intuitive, \u0026 useful! I’m not running this on a new iPhone either, a very full 6s+, \u0026 I have not bought a subscription. It does sometimes open slow, but only when I have a bunch of apps open so it is my phone not the app. This hasn’t completely replaced Things app since nothing (for me) does projects like it, but I no longer use Things for everything, pretty much just business projects. So far this has been a very useful, easy to setup, \u0026 easy to use app that does what it advertises, also working with both Siri \u0026 Alexa.","title":"Convenient, Easy 2 Use, Siri \u0026 Alexa","userName":"tonguetwizted"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5071027983","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-11-02T13:19:42Z","developerResponse":{"id":11611606,"body":"Thanks for the feedback!

I really like having the monthly view with the dots showing which days have events, but I *really* wish the agenda view below it would scroll. It’s more difficult than it should be to move between dates in that view, especially when I’m trying to find time for an appointment far in the future.\n\nAnd this seems like a hard thing to do, so I’m not docking any stars for it, is being able to say or type, “meet Mom for dinner at 7 PM at restaurant,” and then having the app put all that information where it needs to be. Instead, the user has to type all of that in the individual date, time, location, and description fields. I’ve tried other apps that have this feature, and it is so convenient.

I feel like you have to pay for too many features.

Anything that needs explaining is covered when you first open the app! 😄 I use this a lot. It helps me remember what I need to do for homework and it also helps me not procrastinate because it reminds me to do things I need/want to do.
