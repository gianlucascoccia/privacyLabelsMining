All I got was..hope it’s working now. Please rate us. So I am. If you haven’t done anything for me, not even contacted me  what rating can you expect? Well you asked for it and here it is.<br />Ok. They finally sent me a phone number and I called. In the meantime. I had finally found some directions I could follow and perhaps updated it and fixed it. Or they fixed something they had broken...anyway it now works. AND I have a phone number for the future...though I think they have short working hours unlike some companies orne all night and weekends. Phew! In their defense I just realized it all happened over the weekend...but I had expected full service then. Now I know better.</p>

    Worst App Ever

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been using various computer apps for some 35 years, and the Acorn TV app for the Apple TV is the worst app I’ve ever had to use. <br />To begin, the menu system is completely illogical and user hostile. Unlike, Netflix, with the Acorn app for Apple TV once you have selected the program you want (not always easy with the execrable new Apple TV remote), you then get to try and figure out which episode is next in the queue because Acorn doesn’t bother to queue up the next one. You still have to figure out which one it is, with no clues whatsoever. <br />Just finding the program itself is sometimes a challenge. If you go to the recently watched list, and click on the program you want, rather than bringing up the overview screen for the program (from which you can at least begin your search for the next episode to watch), it just starts the episode you’ve already watched. And if you hit the go-back button, it just bumps you back out to the home screen rather than the more logical overview screen for that program.<br />To top off the fun, it will, as often as not, simply refuse to play a program no matter how many times you hit enter on the pad portion of the remote. I end up AirPlaying it from my iPad.<br />The Acorn App for the Apple TV is completely broken. Which is a shame because the app for the iPad and iPhone — a completely different app — is quite good, And the programming is brilliant. If you can get it to play. Shameful!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>After months of happy viewing, something went wrong. I began to get double billed for my subscription, billed by my subscription through iTunes, and then billed directly by acorn. I never signed up directly with acorn, only with iTunes. So I canceled my subscription with acorn, considering that I already had in place an iTunes subscription. Well this is when the horror started.  The app indicates that my subscription is canceled, but my iTunes subscription is active.  I have been struggling with this for months and I cannot get a straight answer out of their customer service desk.  They simply refuse to understand what I am talking about. There is no way to include screenshots when trying to send them messages. And yes there is no restore a purchase link on the home screen. I personally don’t think you can pay for your subscription through iTunes. I think you can download the app from the iTunes Store, but you have to pay acorn directly. The iTunes subscription does not work with this app. I talked to Apple at length about this problem and they are as mystified as I am. It almost seems like there is a scam or some sort of bait and switch problem. There is no Acorn customer service phone number, impossible to speak to a live person, and you will never ever make any sense out of whatever robot you interact with at the help desk.</p>

We use this information to recognize and analyze trends, administer RLJE Services, track our users’ movement throughout RLJE Services, compile demographic information about our overall user base, and adapt RLJE Services to our users’ needs.\n(2)\tCookies, web beacons, and advertising identifiers: Like most sites, RLJE’s Services may use what are known as “cookies” in certain instances, or similar technology such as web beacons, and advertising identifiers, which may use small text files to store a randomly assigned ID and a website reference ID to make your device recognizable to RLJE.

If such Personal Information is tracked by third-party services, the information will be anonymous and for statistical and analytics purposes only unless further agreed upon by you. See our Advertiser Collected Data section above.\n(3)\tAffiliates: Since most of our functions requiring Personal Information (including marketing and technical support) are handled in-house throughout various departments in our company, we may share some or all of your Personal Information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (“Affiliates”) in order to best operate the RLJE Sites and RLJE Services and cater and market them to you according to your interests and feedback. If we acquire additional Affiliates in the future, we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.\n(4)\tCorporate Restructuring: In the occurrence of (or negotiation of) a merger, financing deal, sale, dissolution, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of some or all of our assets, we may share some or all of your Personal Information as is legally or contractually obligated, or as required by virtue of such Personal Information becoming transferred as a business asset in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership.

Please be advised that, regardless of the choices you make regarding your Personal Information, RLJE may be required to disclose such Personal Information as necessary to comply with any current or future state, federal or international laws and regulations, to cooperate with a legal investigation(s), subpoena(s) or warrants served on RLJE, to defend our rights, property (including copyright) or our users (including you) and to investigate or assist in preventing any violation of the state, federal or international law (potential or actual), RLJE’s Privacy Policy, or RLJE’s Terms of Use.\n-\tNOTE REGARDING SOCIAL NETWORKING: RLJE does not share your Personal Information with any social networking service or “SNS” (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). You may voluntarily contribute information, feedback and commentary to an SNS. However, please note that if you choose to share information or post content to these sites regarding an RLJE Site or an RLJE Service, you are solely responsible for your use of those websites. It will be your responsibility to follow the terms of use of such third-party website and review their privacy policy. We cannot and will not in any way be responsible for any activity that occurs on such SNS, including your own activity or use of such website.\n-\tNOTE REGARDING LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES: Further to the SNS note above, An RLJE Site may contain links to web sites operated and maintained by third parties. In addition, such third-party sites may reference, advertise, or link to an RLJE Site. RLJE has no control over these third-party web sites.

By visiting or browsing the RLJE Sites and using the RLJE Services, and by providing your Personal Information to RLJE, all users, including, without limitation, users in the member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection, storage, and processing of such information in the United States and the terms of this Privacy Policy.\n\nEDITING, CORRECTING AND DELETING PERSONAL INFORMATION\nYou can request access to your Personal Information, or correct inaccurate Personal Information by contacting PRIVACY@RLJENTERTAINMENT.COM.\n\nRLJE will keep your Personal Information for as long as you use an RLJE Service or visit an RLJE Site and for an amount of time after you have stopped using the RLJE Service or visiting an RLJE Site for administrative and analysis purposes only.

Unlike, Netflix, with the Acorn app for Apple TV once you have selected the program you want (not always easy with the execrable new Apple TV remote), you then get to try and figure out which episode is next in the queue because Acorn doesn’t bother to queue up the next one. You still have to figure out which one it is, with no clues whatsoever. \nJust finding the program itself is sometimes a challenge. If you go to the recently watched list, and click on the program you want, rather than bringing up the overview screen for the program (from which you can at least begin your search for the next episode to watch), it just starts the episode you’ve already watched. And if you hit the go-back button, it just bumps you back out to the home screen rather than the more logical overview screen for that program.\nTo top off the fun, it will, as often as not, simply refuse to play a program no matter how many times you hit enter on the pad portion of the remote. I end up AirPlaying it from my iPad.\nThe Acorn App for the Apple TV is completely broken. Which is a shame because the app for the iPad and iPhone — a completely different app — is quite good, And the programming is brilliant. If you can get it to play.

I began to get double billed for my subscription, billed by my subscription through iTunes, and then billed directly by acorn. I never signed up directly with acorn, only with iTunes. So I canceled my subscription with acorn, considering that I already had in place an iTunes subscription. Well this is when the horror started.  The app indicates that my subscription is canceled, but my iTunes subscription is active.  I have been struggling with this for months and I cannot get a straight answer out of their customer service desk.  They simply refuse to understand what I am talking about. There is no way to include screenshots when trying to send them messages. And yes there is no restore a purchase link on the home screen. I personally don’t think you can pay for your subscription through iTunes. I think you can download the app from the iTunes Store, but you have to pay acorn directly. The iTunes subscription does not work with this app. I talked to Apple at length about this problem and they are as mystified as I am. It almost seems like there is a scam or some sort of bait and switch problem. There is no Acorn customer service phone number, impossible to speak to a live person, and you will never ever make any sense out of whatever robot you interact with at the help desk.","title":"Worst customer service ever","userName":"HappyBetta"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7396714125","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-05-28T03:23:34Z","rating":3,"review":"This is much better than my previous review.

Ignores start where you left off when you shut it down normally and starts at the beginning requiring you to figure out where you had to stop so that's hit or miss since there is no preview when you look for it. I love Acorn but this app is barely functional. Now it's having emotional problems with the fact I pay on their site. The app is stopping me from streaming and asking me to get a membership via apple. I have to enter account on the app which tells me that I have a membership, then go to the home page and search for the show I want. THEN it will play. Does not offer to play next episode.

And if we try to select the correct episode, we get kicked out of the app. \nSecond problem: we subscribed via the google app on our smart tv.

But unlike other streaming we use, Acorn is unique in not making it easy to see where we left off in watching episodes. This is not a good way to be unique.\n\nRecent review:\n\nFirst Acorn removed essential functionality (tracking progress on series, for example). Then the app stops working with iPads and iPhones. Then the app stops working with Apple TV. And through it all Acorn decides not to reach out to customers to describe the situation and their progress, and not to tell customers that their remaining option is to log in on web browser. So, self-created technical problems compounded by a poor customer service decision. I think Acorn is shooting itself in the foot. I wonder what will happen to # subscribers, and how many will take this as a signal to try Britbox.\n\nAn addition to my review from a week ago. At that time Acorn sent me an email telling me they had reset my password and that the app would work with the reset password. It did not. I just received the exact same message.  And exactly like before, nothing changes with the reset password.
