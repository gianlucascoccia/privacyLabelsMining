        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>4.7.2:<br />• Solved problems some of you were having due to the new changes<br />• Added (and enabled) option to automatically fix your presence upon app opening, since several users are affected by iOS&#39; 15 geofencing bug. Please also try to update to iOS 15.1, as this seems to have helped several users<br /><br /><br />We&#39;ve been busy as a bee - and now you can see some great, but not yet all, of the results. These are the changes: <br /><br />Discotainment with Gradient lights (again)<br />We now support all gradient lights with Discotainment! You should just have the latest bridge firmware installed and may need to turn it on via the menu (three dots), and you should be ready to start! If Gradient lights only appear as one color, set up the device&#39;s orientation in the Hue app!<br /><br />Halloween will be spooky again!<br />As usual, we enable our &quot;Spooky Halloween&quot; animation set, this time we&#39;ve spiced it with some later improvements of our animation engine. The set will - as always - be available until mid of November. In case your gradient lights only show a single color, please try to re-create the Entertainment group.<br /><br />Quicker updates<br />iConnectHue now uses new functions of your Hue bridge, enabling it to show changes to your lights and devices almost immediately! This was quite some work (it actually allowed Gradient Discotainment), and more will follow for us, since we&#39;ll need to update the whole iConnectHue to be compatible with future bridge firmwares.<br />(Available for all members or w/ 2021-Upgrade)<br /><br />For the same reasons, we don&#39;t support the old round bridge any longer officially - meaning we can&#39;t guarantee functionality with it! Currently you can still connect to it, but please understand that this won&#39;t be possible for much longer. Please switch immediately to a new bridge to be able to continue to use iConnectHue!. <br /><br />Holiday scenes<br />Our new holiday scenes bring you to far places - even if you stayed in your country this year. (Available for all members or via in app purchase)<br /><br />Switch to Apple Family Sharing for Pro soon<br />Apple now allows us to enable their family sharing for our Pro membership, hence we will soon disable Family Sharing via Airdrop and will allow you to use our Pro membership via Apple&#39;s Family Sharing. We believe this is the better solution to most of you. Please write us if you think this Family Sharing won&#39;t work for you instead of our Airdrop method.<br /><br />Additional improvements<br />• Quick device lookup by name - swipe down your devices list and start typing (w/ Membership or 2021 upgrade)<br />• Added support for new light types<br />• Additional improvements as usual<br /><br />•• Please give us a positive App Store rating, if you like these changes or want to support iConnectHue. Thank you! ••<br /><br />If you run into any issues, don’t hesitate, contact us from within the app. You will surely get support! Need a quick check for a question? We also have an elaborate FAQ: https://iconnecthue.com/f-a-q/</p>

    THE Philips Hue App

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>With the limitations of both the native Hue app, Apple HomeKit, and all of the other comprehensive controllers, this has by far the most features, the best interface, and makes the most out of your Hue and Friends of Hue devices. It also leverages newer iOS tools like Siri, Shortcuts, and Widgets nicely. Finally, it’s very well supported. The price is cheap for various functions that I found myself buying some of the silly prebuilt color scenes just because I wanted to give the creator the support to keep making a great product. Also, multiple hubs is supported better than Hue does it, though it requires multiple Hue accounts. (Not ICH’s fault.)<br /><br />Sure, there is plenty more stuff that if could have like a way to create a mode to operate where controls were less “volatile” so guests don’t accidentally change your settings. Also, a comprehensive backup and restore functional would be terrific. Since this app can not control what other apps out in your Hue hub. Sometimes they can mess things up so it would be nice to wipe the hub and restore it from a point in time rather than try to manually “clean it”. Based in past experience, of other uses want this too, the developer will probably get on this because the app is constantly improving.<br /><br />Worth every in-app purchase!</p>

    Still and always the best

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I am up to 28 hue lights at my house since getting my first two in 2015. This is by far the best app for managing and using them. Even though Philips improved their free app a couple of years ago, it’s still not nearly as easy to use as iConnectHue. I know because my mom only has five hue lights and she still uses the Philips app, so I do too when I stay at her house. This is a great developer who is constantly improving his app, updating it, making sure it stays bug free as the iOS versions roll out, and coming up with creative new fun things to do with it. The intuitive visual user interface is a genuine pleasure to use both to control lights and to make scenes and Siri Shortcuts. It’s very well worth the money, and the add-ons like the watch app. FYI, the watch app ran too slowly for me to be very useful until I got a series 5. If you would spend as much as $50 for one friggin lightbulb, why not spend five dollars to be able to make the easiest and best use of it? You do get what you pay for, and the Philips app is free. Get what I’m saying?</p>

    Easily the best app for Philips Hue
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is easily the best app for controlling your Philips Hue lights! FAR better, even, than the app from Philips Hue! The ability to create scenes, animations, etc., makes it one or two touches to have your lights do exactly what you want them to do! The apartment I built doesn’t have windows, so I was looking to build a lighting system that could follow the sun in both brightness and color temperature in the built-in “windows” I created to emulate sunrise and sunset and all the stages of lighting throughout the day. The systems I was looking at were going to cost $2,000-$5,000! Then I found Philips Hue and this app. It allows me to do all of that and so much more. I now have my entire house automated with the Hue lights and accessories through this app. The addition of motion detectors and programming to control exactly what I want to happen is incredible. And when I want them to change to something different, one touch of the button is all it takes. Create zones, rooms......whatever you want and have it do whatever you want! Just a great app!!</p>

Solved problems some of you were having due to the new changes\n• Added (and enabled) option to automatically fix your presence upon app opening, since several users are affected by iOS' 15 geofencing bug. Please also try to update to iOS 15.1, as this seems to have helped several users\n\n\nWe've been busy as a bee - and now you can see some great, but not yet all, of the results. These are the changes: \n\nDiscotainment with Gradient lights (again)\nWe now support all gradient lights with Discotainment! You should just have the latest bridge firmware installed and may need to turn it on via the menu (three dots), and you should be ready to start! If Gradient lights only appear as one color, set up the device's orientation in the Hue app!\n\nHalloween will be spooky again!\nAs usual, we enable our \"Spooky Halloween\" animation set, this time we've spiced it with some later improvements of our animation engine. The set will - as always - be available until mid of November. In case your gradient lights only show a single color, please try to re-create the Entertainment group.\n\nQuicker updates\niConnectHue now uses new functions of your Hue bridge, enabling it to show changes to your lights and devices almost immediately! This was quite some work (it actually allowed Gradient Discotainment), and more will follow for us, since we'll need to update the whole iConnectHue to be compatible with future bridge firmwares.\n(Available for all members or w/ 2021-Upgrade)\n\nFor the same reasons, we don't support the old round bridge any longer officially - meaning we can't guarantee functionality with it! Currently you can still connect to it, but please understand that this won't be possible for much longer. Please switch immediately to a new bridge to be able to continue to use iConnectHue!. \n\nHoliday scenes\nOur new holiday scenes bring you to far places - even if you stayed in your country this year. (Available for all members or via in app purchase)\n\nSwitch to Apple Family Sharing for Pro soon\nApple now allows us to enable their family sharing for our Pro membership, hence we will soon disable Family Sharing via Airdrop and will allow you to use our Pro membership via Apple's Family Sharing. We believe this is the better solution to most of you. Please write us if you think this Family Sharing won't work for you instead of our Airdrop method.\n\nAdditional improvements\n• Quick device lookup by name - swipe down your devices list and start typing (w/ Membership or 2021 upgrade)\n• Added support for new light types\n• Additional improvements as usual\n\n•• Please give us a positive App Store rating, if you like these changes or want to support iConnectHue. Thank you! ••\n\nIf you run into any issues, don’t hesitate, contact us from within the app. You will surely get support! Need a quick check for a question?

These are the changes: \n\nDiscotainment with Gradient lights (again)\nWe now support all gradient lights with Discotainment! You should just have the latest bridge firmware installed and may need to turn it on via the menu (three dots), and you should be ready to start!\n\nHalloween will be spooky again!\nAs usual, we enable our \"Spooky Halloween\" animation set, this time we've spiced it with some later improvements of our animation engine. The set will - as always - be available until mid of November. In case your gradient lights only show a single color, please try to re-create the Entertainment group.\n\nQuicker updates\niConnectHue now uses new functions of your Hue bridge, enabling it to show changes to your lights and devices almost immediately! This was quite some work (it actually allowed Gradient Discotainment), and more will follow for us, since we'll need to update the whole iConnectHue to be compatible with future bridge firmwares.\n(Available for all members or w/ 2021-Upgrade)\n\nFor the same reasons, we don't support the old round bridge any longer officially - meaning we can't guarantee functionality with it! Currently you can still connect to it, but please understand that this won't be possible for much longer. Please switch immediately to a new bridge to be able to continue to use iConnectHue!. \n\nHoliday scenes\nOur new holiday scenes bring you to far places - even if you stayed in your country this year. (Available for all members or via in app purchase)\n\nSwitch to Apple Family Sharing for Pro soon\nApple now allows us to enable their family sharing for our Pro membership, hence we will soon disable Family Sharing via Airdrop and will allow you to use our Pro membership via Apple's Family Sharing. We believe this is the better solution to most of you.

It also leverages newer iOS tools like Siri, Shortcuts, and Widgets nicely. Finally, it’s very well supported. The price is cheap for various functions that I found myself buying some of the silly prebuilt color scenes just because I wanted to give the creator the support to keep making a great product. Also, multiple hubs is supported better than Hue does it, though it requires multiple Hue accounts. (Not ICH’s fault.)\n\nSure, there is plenty more stuff that if could have like a way to create a mode to operate where controls were less “volatile” so guests don’t accidentally change your settings. Also, a comprehensive backup and restore functional would be terrific. Since this app can not control what other apps out in your Hue hub. Sometimes they can mess things up so it would be nice to wipe the hub and restore it from a point in time rather than try to manually “clean it”.

This is by far the best app for managing and using them. Even though Philips improved their free app a couple of years ago, it’s still not nearly as easy to use as iConnectHue. I know because my mom only has five hue lights and she still uses the Philips app, so I do too when I stay at her house. This is a great developer who is constantly improving his app, updating it, making sure it stays bug free as the iOS versions roll out, and coming up with creative new fun things to do with it. The intuitive visual user interface is a genuine pleasure to use both to control lights and to make scenes and Siri Shortcuts. It’s very well worth the money, and the add-ons like the watch app. FYI, the watch app ran too slowly for me to be very useful until I got a series 5. If you would spend as much as $50 for one friggin lightbulb, why not spend five dollars to be able to make the easiest and best use of it? You do get what you pay for, and the Philips app is free.

FAR better, even, than the app from Philips Hue! The ability to create scenes, animations, etc., makes it one or two touches to have your lights do exactly what you want them to do! The apartment I built doesn’t have windows, so I was looking to build a lighting system that could follow the sun in both brightness and color temperature in the built-in “windows” I created to emulate sunrise and sunset and all the stages of lighting throughout the day. The systems I was looking at were going to cost $2,000-$5,000! Then I found Philips Hue and this app. It allows me to do all of that and so much more. I now have my entire house automated with the Hue lights and accessories through this app. The addition of motion detectors and programming to control exactly what I want to happen is incredible. And when I want them to change to something different, one touch of the button is all it takes. Create zones, rooms......whatever you want and have it do whatever you want!

I’m gonna to just put these buttons everywhere. Then I’ll assign cryptic icons to them with little to no explanation”. At least they don’t refer to it as intuitive. And good, cause it’s not. At all. You’ll have to spend a good long while just farting around with what each section does, then more time trying to figure out how to apply it to one or more areas, then more time if you want to learn how to do any “animations”. Then more money of course if you want to use any of those. Oh, then more time trying to figure out how to organize your “custom” “animations”. I bet you could take a room full of 10 adults and spend more than 4 hours teaching them how to use this app, and they’d come out of there still not being a “pro level user”. It’s just so tedious. The good news is, when you do get it down, it does do the most things with your lights and switches.

You should just have the latest bridge firmware installed and may need to turn it on via the menu (three dots), and you should be ready to start! If Gradient lights only appear as one color, set up the device's orientation in the Hue app!\n\nHalloween will be spooky again!\nAs usual, we enable our \"Spooky Halloween\" animation set, this time we've spiced it with some later improvements of our animation engine. The set will - as always - be available until mid of November. In case your gradient lights only show a single color, please try to re-create the Entertainment group.\n\nQuicker updates\niConnectHue now uses new functions of your Hue bridge, enabling it to show changes to your lights and devices almost immediately! This was quite some work (it actually allowed Gradient Discotainment), and more will follow for us, since we'll need to update the whole iConnectHue to be compatible with future bridge firmwares.\n(Available for all members or w/ 2021-Upgrade)\n\nFor the same reasons, we don't support the old round bridge any longer officially - meaning we can't guarantee functionality with it! Currently you can still connect to it, but please understand that this won't be possible for much longer.

(Available for all members or via in app purchase)\n\nSwitch to Apple Family Sharing for Pro soon\nApple now allows us to enable their family sharing for our Pro membership, hence we will soon disable Family Sharing via Airdrop and will allow you to use our Pro membership via Apple's Family Sharing. We believe this is the better solution to most of you. Please write us if you think this Family Sharing won't work for you instead of our Airdrop method.\n\nAdditional improvements\n• Quick device lookup by name - swipe down your devices list and start typing (w/ Membership or 2021 upgrade)\n• Added support for new light types\n• Additional improvements as usual\n\n•• Please give us a positive App Store rating, if you like these changes or want to support iConnectHue.
