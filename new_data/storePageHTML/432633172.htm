        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve had some suspect dealings. One person came out and gave me a reasonable price. Then we he started he came back and said it needs some additional work. This is after the deposit and states he can’t insure the other part without doing this part. I had one person show up almost two hours late and didn’t call to notify me he was going to be late. Angi has a policy they need to do better at informing customers about. I needed to have a section of drywall replaced. When he finally got there he asked me did I have the materials? No one comes out to your home and takes a look to tell you what your going to need. Somehow the customer is suppose to know what the workers will need. Getting a tv mounted is one thing but consumers are suppose to know what kind, size and quantities will be needed. Customers are suppose to know what kind of nails or whatever else they need to hang the drywall. They charged me for the job then when I complained they said the money is only for the labor we are suppose to provide the products needed. I was charged 400 to replace a section of drywall but instead al he did was mud the hole. I had to make a complaint to get refund. Angi doesn’t ask you any questions about the job or confirm it was done correctly. I had to sit on the phone about an hour to make a complaint and then wait a couple days for someone to email me. Then they reduced the charge to 200 but didn’t refund me the difference but gave me a credit.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>If you research a project, they want your info, which they will share however they want. This is pushed to contractors who will begin to hound you. HomeAdvisor gives out all your info and it is creepy!!!! It is nearly impossible to cancel a project to stop the hounds from chasing you! AND you can’t cancel your whole account! It’s like I am a prisoner! They listed 4 pros and after the first day, I counted 8 different pros who called me and left messages. 8! Why didn’t they tell me/reveal all 8 options! They try to hide their directory of pros, but then send your phone number, email, home address, etc. to businesses you never even saw matched!!!! I found a way to turn off email and phone number, but once those businesses have your info, they keep calling. Also, tucked away in the app, in the account option, is the option to view their pros without starting a project (aka alerting the hounds)! <br />They called so many times, my iPhone automatically labeled them as Spam Risks. They have called, emailed, text messaged, left voicemails, etc. One guy even sounded rude and short tempered in his third voicemail! The appropriate thing as a pro is to call and leave a voicemail ONE TIME. Then if I want to call back, I will. I have black listed any pro who harasses me this way!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I used their single price service, where you say what you need, get a price, and schedule a time. Home Advisor finds the technician and sends them out. But they’re supposed to confirm ahead of time who is coming.<br /><br />They never told me who would show up, the app just said the technician’s name was “Homeadviser H.” 🙄 The phone number to contact them went to a recorded, “thanks for calling,” them hung up. When no one showed, I called the number that Home Advisor texted this morning to contact them, and after 15 minutes on hold the person who answered said she couldn’t help with their Single Price bookings. 🤦🏼‍♀️ After 5 more minutes on hold with the correct department, they asked for a bunch of personal information the previous CSR hadn’t needed and at about that time my service person arrived.<br /><br />My technician had no idea he’d been connected to the job through Home Adviser. Turns out he’s an awesome dude, employee owned business, etc. But Home Adviser wouldn’t know any of that, because he was hired through a completely different middleman company and Home Adviser never bothered to actually find out who they were sending to their customer’s home. So I’ll never be using their worthless services again, and instead I’ll be asking this super cool dude for recommendations of other employee-owned businesses.</p>

Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.\n\nFor example, when you sign in to our website, we will record your user or member ID and the name on your user or member account in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.\n\nYou may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click \"Help\" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our website may not function properly.\n\n Web Beacons:\n\nWeb beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.\n\nWeb beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.\n\nMobile Device IDs: If you're using an app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), instead of cookies, to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our apps. Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted. Ad companies use device IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage. We share device IDs with service providers who power certain features, such as voice recognition.","is32bitOnly":false,"isStandaloneWithCompanionForWatchOS":false,"seller":"HomeAdvisor, Inc.","isSiriSupported":false,"languageList":["English"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"description":{"standard":"HomeAdvisor is the #1 home improvement service connecting homeowners with home improvement contractors.

One person came out and gave me a reasonable price. Then we he started he came back and said it needs some additional work. This is after the deposit and states he can’t insure the other part without doing this part. I had one person show up almost two hours late and didn’t call to notify me he was going to be late. Angi has a policy they need to do better at informing customers about. I needed to have a section of drywall replaced. When he finally got there he asked me did I have the materials? No one comes out to your home and takes a look to tell you what your going to need. Somehow the customer is suppose to know what the workers will need. Getting a tv mounted is one thing but consumers are suppose to know what kind, size and quantities will be needed. Customers are suppose to know what kind of nails or whatever else they need to hang the drywall. They charged me for the job then when I complained they said the money is only for the labor we are suppose to provide the products needed. I was charged 400 to replace a section of drywall but instead al he did was mud the hole. I had to make a complaint to get refund. Angi doesn’t ask you any questions about the job or confirm it was done correctly. I had to sit on the phone about an hour to make a complaint and then wait a couple days for someone to email me. Then they reduced the charge to 200 but didn’t refund me the difference but gave me a credit.","title":"Not sold on it.","userName":"Santino the great"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6380984544","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-08-31T15:29:38Z","rating":1,"review":"If you research a project, they want your info, which they will share however they want.

I found a way to turn off email and phone number, but once those businesses have your info, they keep calling. Also, tucked away in the app, in the account option, is the option to view their pros without starting a project (aka alerting the hounds)! \nThey called so many times, my iPhone automatically labeled them as Spam Risks. They have called, emailed, text messaged, left voicemails, etc. One guy even sounded rude and short tempered in his third voicemail!

When no one showed, I called the number that Home Advisor texted this morning to contact them, and after 15 minutes on hold the person who answered said she couldn’t help with their Single Price bookings. 🤦🏼‍♀️ After 5 more minutes on hold with the correct department, they asked for a bunch of personal information the previous CSR hadn’t needed and at about that time my service person arrived.\n\nMy technician had no idea he’d been connected to the job through Home Adviser. Turns out he’s an awesome dude, employee owned business, etc. But Home Adviser wouldn’t know any of that, because he was hired through a completely different middleman company and Home Adviser never bothered to actually find out who they were sending to their customer’s home.

I hired an A/C company that had a good sales guy, but a lousy install team. The second time was for a landscaper, no one called. The last time was for stucco work and there was only one contractor who called. I almost hired him because “Hey, Home Advisor knows what they’re doing right?”. Well after consulting two other contractors who were a bit higher priced, I found out that the way in which he was suggesting to repair the home would have caused more expensive problems than doing it right the first time. There were no other stucco contractors on their list. I am only 10 minutes away from a city of 100k+ people and they couldn’t find two other contractors for the area? Then there are the constant emails asking for reviews, suggesting other project ideas, etc. Plus if you’re not careful, you’ll answer the phone and have to get pulled into a 5 minute follow-up call and apology. \nDo what our parents and grandparents did for decades before the golden age of technology.

I’ll give 3 examples where it was anywhere from useless to a waste of time to hiring someone who had “verified” reviews but was one of the WORST “home pros” I hired in all of the people I have contracted to do work on my house in the past 2 years.  1) I wanted to get pro referrals for a bathroom remodel.  I got one referral that was decent.  All of the rest “didn’t have time”, and one came over smelling like a distillery to look at the job for an estimate.  It took him 3 weeks to get back to me.  Needless to say, I didn’t hire any of these people.  Completely useless and a waste of time.  2) I had personal property to get appraised and, even though I was very specific with the search, they sent me real estate appraisers.  There’s no way to even give them feedback that they need to improve their searches!  —that was the waste of time. 3) here’s the biggie- I hired “25 painters” to paint my house 2 years ago using HomeAdvisor.  They say they have verified reviews.  BE CAREFUL.  Look at other sites for reviews!  This group took MONTHS to paint my house.  They sent people that were clearly not painters and I had to continually keep lists of what they had missed.

At 5:00 AM they sent me an email saying the appointment was canceled because they could not find a professional to meet my schedule.   First of all, I selected a time and date from their available options when I set up the appointment.  If those times aren’t good they should not offer them.   Secondly to wait until 5:00AM the morning of to send out an email to cancel it totally unacceptable!!!  I also received a text message 45 min prior to the appointment to say it was rescheduled for the next week.  Again totally unacceptable!   The kicker here to add insult to injury is that they already charged my Credit card for the service.   I instantly requested reimbursement and was assured the charges were reversed and would show up in 3 to 4 days.   At least they have that part of the process down well.

When I complained that  the job clearly had not been done, and that I could send them photos to prove that there is snow on my driveway, they offered to send another contractor out in 48 hours (which was their next available appointment). I can’t wait 48 hours because I have to get my car out to go to work, so I asked them to just cancel my appointment, at which point, I was informed that the contractor had already been paid and that I would only get 50% of my money back.

When we called to get our bill down to the cap that THEY had us create, they  refused to give us our money back for leads that we would not use and instead paused the account to stop more leads from coming in.
