        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>When I got this app I thought it was going to be bad, but I was pleasantly proven wrong. That’s not to say that I’m completely satisfied with it. There were a few issues I ran into, and a couple personal complaints that I have. <br /><br />    So to begin. The downloading was actually pretty good, it was fast and it seemed to work pretty well for me, but there were a few issues I encountered with it. All of the downloaded shows had no images and the names of the episodes were all something random, one of them didn’t even play, and a few of them would freeze at a specific time in the show no matter how many times I tried watching it (I had to skip ahead in the episode to fix it). But other than that I have no complaints about the downloading, it saved me during a long car ride, and it surprisingly takes barely any battery.<br /><br />   Now on to the personal complaints. I really wish there were more shows. To my knowledge, they literally have the rights to all of these awesome old shows, but for some reason they won’t add them, yeah they got some good shows right now, but where is Dexter’s Lab, Ed Edd n’ Eddy, Chowder, etc. Because if you really think about it, Boomerang is charging us half the price as a Netflix subscription for a medium list of shows that they own the rights to. That’s pretty much my only complaints though. I enjoy a few of the shows on here, and I’m really happy at how easy they are to watch.</p>

    Really good app with room to improve

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve gotta say I’m pretty blown away by the overall quality of the app and programming. While my review was 4 stars I would say it’s more of a 4.5. I was very skeptical when it was announced given the dive in quality of the Boomerang TV channel. However, I was proven wrong in a big way. The selection is great and growing not to mention the app and  website seem to have been put together really well. It seems like the team working on them real took time and effort to make it a good quality. The only disappointing part is the inconsistency of the downloading feature. Some episodes downloaded correctly while others did not. For example, one episode downloaded but didn’t have any audio. Others simply didn’t want to play. I also think a couple tweaks to the mobile app would be very beneficial. For example, I think adding a downloaded tab that takes you to all of the content you downloaded would be much more convenient than having to scroll to the bottom of the mobile app to find that section. I’m also not the biggest fan of episodes continuously playing whenever I’m scrolling through episodes on the desktop version. It’s not a major deal just something I’m not the biggest fan of. Again, overall it’s been a great experience and if a couple tweaks are made and content is being added regularly I don’t see why this app/service couldn’t become even better.</p>

    A good app, but needs some work.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>it sure is nice having a streaming service which allows me to see many of the cartoons I had watched on reruns growing up as a kid, especially since at least some of them are not available for purchase in any format. The annual or monthly subscription rates are very reasonable just for those facts alone. Here is where the app needs some work, it is not completely voiceover compliant, and anyone who has difficulty reading the screen and the information on the icons as I do and probably many other users have, can probably appreciate this issue. what we end up with, is my clicking on a choice and not knowing exactly what I’m about to watch until it comes on the screen, at which point I can recognize it there. But it would be nice to have this app be 100% voiceover compatible, and since I have other streaming services which already have this capability, I know it can be done. If the developers listen to or read this review and correct this issue, I would have absolutely no problem changing my reading to five stars. However, it does earn a solid four star rating just the same.</p>

Entertainment, Inc. and Warner Bros. Digital Labs (collectively “Boomerang,” “we,” “us” or “our”), are committed to protecting the privacy of children who use our sites and applications. This Children’s Privacy Policy explains Boomerang’s information collection, disclosure, and parental consent practices in accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) with respect to types of information that may be provided by children under the age of 13 (“child” or “children”) and how and when we will provide parental notices and/or seek parental consent for activity on watch.boomerang.com, the video areas of the Boomerang app, and wherever this Children’s Policy is posted.  This Privacy Policy uses terms that are defined in Boomerang’s general Privacy Policy located below and at www.boomerang.com where parents may subscribe and acquire more information about the Boomerang service. \n\nTypes of Information Collected and Used on Watch.Boomerang.com\n\nPersistent Identifiers\nWhen visitors watch content and interact with the Boomerang services, certain information may automatically be collected, both to make our sites and applications more interesting and useful to viewers and for various purposes related to our business. Examples include the type of computer operating system, the IP address or mobile device identifier, the web browser, the frequency with which the user visits various parts of our sites or applications, and information regarding the online or mobile service provider. This information is collected using technologies such as cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, and other unique identifiers (which we define under the “Cookies and Other Online Tracking Technologies” section of our general Privacy Policy). This information may be collected by Boomerang or by a third party. This type of data collected from the www.watch.boomerang.com site and video areas of the Boomerang app is principally used for internal purposes only, in order to:\n \n·     Provide visitors with access to features and activities on our sites and applications\n·     Customize content and improve our sites and applications\n·     Conduct research and analysis to address the performance of our sites and applications and of the marketing for our sites and applications\n·     Generate anonymous reporting for use by Boomerang\n \nIn the event we collect and use such information from children on our sites and applications for different types of purposes, we will notify parents and obtain appropriate consent prior to such collection and use.\nEmail Contact with a Child\n \nIn order to respond to a customer service question or request from a child, Boomerang may need to ask for the child’s online contact information, such as an email address. We will delete children’s online contact information after responding to the question or request.  In connection with certain activities or services, we may collect a child’s online contact information, such as an email address, in order to communicate with the child more than once. In such instances we will retain the child’s online contact information to honor the request and for no other purpose such as marketing. An example would be a newsletter or blog alert that provides occasional updates about the Boomerang service. Whenever we collect a child’s online contact information for such ongoing communications, we will simultaneously require a parent email address in order to notify the parent about the collection and use of the child’s information, as well as to provide the parent an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child.\n \nPush Notifications\nPush notifications are notifications on mobile and other devices that are typically associated with downloaded applications, and which can communicate to the device holder even when the application is not open or in use. We will require a child to provide a parent email address before a child under the age of 13 can sign up to receive push notifications from Boomerang that collect a device identifier. We will then provide the parent with notice of our contact with the child and instructions on how to prevent further notifications.\n \nOther Ways We Use, Share or Disclose Information from Children\nWe also may use, share or disclose personal information collected from children in a limited number of instances, including the following:\nWe may share information with our service providers if necessary for them to perform a business, professional, or technology support function for us.\n\nWe may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information collected from children (i) in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request; (ii) if we believe disclosure may prevent fraud or potentially illegal acts, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our sites or applications; (iii) to protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (iv) enable us to take precautions against liability.\n \nPlease note that we will not require a child to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an online activity. If we collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the activity, and ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law. In the event we discover we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA’s requirements, we will either delete the information or immediately seek the parent’s consent for that collection.  A child’s personal information will not be disclosed to an unaffiliated third party or used in a way that is materially different than stated above unless we first provide parental notice and receive appropriate parental consent.  For details on how we may use children’s personal information in connection with a parent’s subscription or consent, please see the “Additional Information Regarding Children’s Privacy” section of Boomerang’s general Privacy Policy.\n \nRequests to Delete, Access or Correct Information\nA parent or legal guardian will have the ability to review or request deletion of any of their child’s personal information or refuse to permit its further collection or use. If you are a parent or legal guardian who would like to exercise these rights or has discovered that your child has registered for or accessed Boomerang without your consent, you can ask us to remove any unauthorized information provided by your child by contacting us at privacy.boomerangplus@turner.com or our customer service at support@boomerang.com. Upon valid notice from you, Boomerang will make reasonable efforts to investigate and remove the information. You may be asked to provide customer service with the account email address or username and account password submitted by your child. Please review the Terms of Use for information regarding how to cancel a subscription. Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a termination of an account, membership, or other service.\n\nAny other privacy inquiries may be directed to:\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc., Attention: Privacy Policy Coordinator – Legal\n1050 Techwood Drive, Atlanta, Georgia 30318\nEmail: privacy.boomerangplus@turner.com\nPhone: 4O4-878-O694\n \nIn any correspondence such as e-mail or mail, please include the email associated with the Boomerang account and the parent’s email address and telephone number. To protect children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify a parent’s identity before granting access to any personal information.\n\nUpdates \u0026 Effective Date\nFrom time to time, we may update this Children’s Privacy Policy. We will notify you about material changes by either sending an email message to the email address you most recently provided to us or by prominently posting a notice on our Service. If material changes would affect personal information previously collected from children, we also would obtain appropriate consent from a parent or legal guardian. We also encourage you to periodically check back and review this Children’s Privacy Policy so that you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and with whom we share it.\n\nThe Children’s Privacy Policy posted on this Service was effective on October 29th, 2018.\n\n \n*********************************************************************\n\nWhat's New in the Updated Privacy Policy?

We or a Partner may use “cookies” or similar technologies to associate certain of the Information with a unique identifier that then associates the Information with your device or browser. For information about how these technologies work and how we may use them, please go to Section IV, titled Cookies, And Other User And Ad-Targeting Technologies. Sometimes, we may associate cookies with the Information, including de-identified, “hashed,” or anonymous versions of Information you have provided (such as during registration), in order to send or help our Partners send ads and offers based on your presumed interests or demographic information. We may combine any of the Information we collect, for any of the above purposes, and may sometimes enhance the Information with other information that we obtain from third party sources. Please also be aware that if you choose to submit Information or content for publication (e.g., a letter to our editors, comments sent to our television personalities, a posting to a blog or a discussion board, or a video), we may publish that Information and content, along with other Information about you (such as your name, screen name or location). See our Terms of Use for details on our use of content you submit.\n\nInformation Sharing and Disclosure\nWe may disclose the Information as follows:\nTo service providers or Partners that we have engaged to perform business-related functions on our behalf.

A representative list of Turner Affiliates is available at https://turneraffiliates.turner.com/Affiliates/Turner-Affiliates-English.\nWe may share the Information with unaffiliated Partners and third parties (e.g., advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that wish to market products or services to you. If you wish to opt out from such marketing, please visit the How to Contact Us/Opting Out of Marketing Communications Section below for further instructions.\nWe may share the Information for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect the Information or pursuant to your consent.\nPlease note that the Services covered by this Privacy Policy may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications, or social network integrations) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain information from their visitors. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information, which is subject to their own privacy policies.\n\nCookies and Other Online Tracking Technologies.\nWe use cookies and other technologies both to provide our Services to you and to advertise to you. We also may work with Partners to help them advertise to you when you visit other websites or mobile applications, and to help them perform user analytics. These technologies may also be used by our Partners to collect and analyze information about our Users’ activities on our Services and elsewhere on the Internet (including how our Users interact with advertising), and more generally, to learn more about our Users and what services or offers you might prefer to receive. We describe some of these technologies below.\nCookies.\nTo enhance your online experience, we and our Partners use \"cookies\", \"web beacons\" or other tracking technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. We use cookies or other tracking technologies to understand Service and Internet usage and to improve or customize the products, content, offerings, services or advertisements on our Services. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Services (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a Service), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our Services. We also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to help us offer you products, content, offerings or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising when you visit this Service, a Turner Affiliate’s Service, or when you visit other websites or applications. We or a third party platform with whom we work may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized content, offers, services or advertisements on our Services or other sites. The cookies may be associated with de-identified demographic or other data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.\nWe, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our Partners also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or other networks or Services. This also helps us, our service providers and Partners provide more relevant advertising.\n\nSyncing Cookies and Identifiers.\nWe may work with our Partners (for instance, third party ad platforms) to synchronize unique, anonymous identifiers (such as those associated with cookies) in order to match our Partners’ uniquely coded user identifiers to our own. We may do this, for instance, to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device, and thus enable us or others to send ads that are more relevant, match Users to their likely product interests, or better synchronize, cap, or optimize advertising.\n\nLocally Stored Objects.\nServices on the Turner Network may employ locally stored objects (“LSOs”) and other client side storage tracking technologies in certain situations where they help to provide a better user experience, such as to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies, or in order to target or help our Partners target ads, analyze ad performance, or perform user, website or market analytics. For LSOs utilized by Adobe Flash you can access Flash management tools from Adobe’s website. In addition, some, but not all browsers provide the ability to remove LSOs, sometimes within cookie and privacy settings.\n\nDisabling Cookies\nMost web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of the Services may be difficult to use or inoperable.\n\nWe may work with certain third-party companies that use techniques other than cookies to recognize your computer or device, link your devices, and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity, including those integrated with our Services. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these techniques, and those browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such techniques. To learn more about Interest-Based Advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising by those third parties that are members of DAA’s opt-out program, please go to About Ads.\n\nWeb Beacons.\nWe and our Partners may also use \"web beacons\" or clear GIFs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a Service or in an email, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a Service or email. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that Service. Web beacons may also be used to provide information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns (e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.).\n\nMobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.\nWe also sometimes use, or partner with publishers, publisher-facing, or app developer platforms that use mobile Software Development Kits (“SDKs”), or use an SDK with a mobile app that we offer, to collect Information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., Apple IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and Information connected to how mobile devices interact with our Services and those using our Services. The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services or analytics to be performed.

Entertainment, Inc. and Warner Bros. Digital Labs (collectively “Boomerang,” “we,” “us” or “our”), are committed to protecting the privacy of children who use our sites and applications. This Children’s Privacy Policy explains Boomerang’s information collection, disclosure, and parental consent practices in accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) with respect to types of information that may be provided by children under the age of 13 (“child” or “children”) and how and when we will provide parental notices and/or seek parental consent for activity on watch.boomerang.com, the video areas of the Boomerang app, and wherever this Children’s Policy is posted.  This Privacy Policy uses terms that are defined in Boomerang’s general Privacy Policy located below and at www.boomerang.com where parents may subscribe and acquire more information about the Boomerang service. \n\nTypes of Information Collected and Used on Watch.Boomerang.com\n\nPersistent Identifiers\nWhen visitors watch content and interact with the Boomerang services, certain information may automatically be collected, both to make our sites and applications more interesting and useful to viewers and for various purposes related to our business. Examples include the type of computer operating system, the IP address or mobile device identifier, the web browser, the frequency with which the user visits various parts of our sites or applications, and information regarding the online or mobile service provider. This information is collected using technologies such as cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, and other unique identifiers (which we define under the “Cookies and Other Online Tracking Technologies” section of our general Privacy Policy). This information may be collected by Boomerang or by a third party. This type of data collected from the www.watch.boomerang.com site and video areas of the Boomerang app is principally used for internal purposes only, in order to:\n \n·     Provide visitors with access to features and activities on our sites and applications\n·     Customize content and improve our sites and applications\n·     Conduct research and analysis to address the performance of our sites and applications and of the marketing for our sites and applications\n·     Generate anonymous reporting for use by Boomerang\n \nIn the event we collect and use such information from children on our sites and applications for different types of purposes, we will notify parents and obtain appropriate consent prior to such collection and use.\nEmail Contact with a Child\n \nIn order to respond to a customer service question or request from a child, Boomerang may need to ask for the child’s online contact information, such as an email address. We will delete children’s online contact information after responding to the question or request.  In connection with certain activities or services, we may collect a child’s online contact information, such as an email address, in order to communicate with the child more than once. In such instances we will retain the child’s online contact information to honor the request and for no other purpose such as marketing. An example would be a newsletter or blog alert that provides occasional updates about the Boomerang service. Whenever we collect a child’s online contact information for such ongoing communications, we will simultaneously require a parent email address in order to notify the parent about the collection and use of the child’s information, as well as to provide the parent an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child.\n \nPush Notifications\nPush notifications are notifications on mobile and other devices that are typically associated with downloaded applications, and which can communicate to the device holder even when the application is not open or in use. We will require a child to provide a parent email address before a child under the age of 13 can sign up to receive push notifications from Boomerang that collect a device identifier. We will then provide the parent with notice of our contact with the child and instructions on how to prevent further notifications.\n \nOther Ways We Use, Share or Disclose Information from Children\nWe also may use, share or disclose personal information collected from children in a limited number of instances, including the following:\nWe may share information with our service providers if necessary for them to perform a business, professional, or technology support function for us.\n\nWe may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information collected from children (i) in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request; (ii) if we believe disclosure may prevent fraud or potentially illegal acts, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our sites or applications; (iii) to protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (iv) enable us to take precautions against liability.\n \nPlease note that we will not require a child to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an online activity. If we collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the activity, and ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law. In the event we discover we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA’s requirements, we will either delete the information or immediately seek the parent’s consent for that collection.

In this Privacy Policy, we refer to all of this as the “Information”.\n\nInformation You Provide To Us.\nAt some Services, you can register, order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our Services such as a paid membership, sign up for our online newsletters or text message alerts, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. In the course of these various offerings, we often seek to collect from you various forms of Information, such as: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number and credit card information.

If you agree to such collection, in most cases, you will be able to turn off such data collection at any time by accessing the privacy settings of your mobile device and/or through the settings in the applicable mobile application.\n\nInformation Collected By and From Social Media Services and Other Third Party Platforms\nYou may also be given the option to engage with our content or Services, such as video, games, applications, and other offerings, on or through social media services or other third party platforms, such as Facebook, or other third-party social media plug-ins, integrations and applications. When you engage with our content or Services on or through social media services or other third party platforms, plug-ins, integrations or applications, you may allow us to have access to certain Information in your profile. This may include your name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, location, an ID associated with the applicable third party platform or social media account user files, photos and videos, your list of friends or connections, people you follow and/or who follow you, or your posts or “likes.” For a description of how social media services and other third party platforms, plug-ins, integrations or applications handle your information, please refer to their respective privacy policies and terms of use, which may permit you to modify your privacy settings. When we interact with you through our content on third party websites, applications, integrations or platforms, we may obtain any information regarding your interaction with that content, such as content you have viewed, your game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on.\n\nHow We Use the Information\nWe, along with our Partners, may use the Information to:\nprovide and communicate with you about the Services or your account with us,\nfulfill your requests regarding the Services, including without limitation requests for newsletters and notifications,\nrespond to your inquiries, and notify you if you have won a contest,\ncommunicate with you about other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you,\nenforce the legal terms (including without limitation our policies and terms of service) that govern your use of our Services, and/or for the purposes for which you provided the Information,\nprovide technical support for the Services,\nprevent fraud or potentially illegal activities (including, without limitation, copyright infringement) on or through the Services,\nprotect the safety of our Users,\ncustomize or personalize ads, offers and content made available to you based on your visits to and/or usage of the Services or other online or mobile websites, applications, platforms or services, and analyze the performance of those ads, offers and content, as well as your interaction with them,\nperform analysis regarding how you use the Services or any part thereof,\nsend gifts, cards, invitations or emails if you use these services, to your designated recipients,\nfor any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent.\n\nWhen you provide information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Services, (3) contact you through the social media service or directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards, and (4) enable you to share your experience and content via social media services. When you provide information about yourself to us through an application, through our Services, or on social media services or other third party platforms, it may be publicly viewed by other members of these services and we cannot prevent further use of the information by third parties. We or a Partner may use “cookies” or similar technologies to associate certain of the Information with a unique identifier that then associates the Information with your device or browser. For information about how these technologies work and how we may use them, please go to Section IV, titled Cookies, And Other User And Ad-Targeting Technologies. Sometimes, we may associate cookies with the Information, including de-identified, “hashed,” or anonymous versions of Information you have provided (such as during registration), in order to send or help our Partners send ads and offers based on your presumed interests or demographic information. We may combine any of the Information we collect, for any of the above purposes, and may sometimes enhance the Information with other information that we obtain from third party sources. Please also be aware that if you choose to submit Information or content for publication (e.g., a letter to our editors, comments sent to our television personalities, a posting to a blog or a discussion board, or a video), we may publish that Information and content, along with other Information about you (such as your name, screen name or location). See our Terms of Use for details on our use of content you submit.\n\nInformation Sharing and Disclosure\nWe may disclose the Information as follows:\nTo service providers or Partners that we have engaged to perform business-related functions on our behalf. This may include service providers that: (a) conduct research and analytics; (b) create content; (c) provide customer, technical or operational support; (d) conduct or support marketing (such as email or advertising platforms); (e) fulfill orders and user requests; (f) handle payments; (g) host our Services, forums and online communities; (h) administer contests; (i) maintain databases; (j) send or support online or mobile advertising; and (k) otherwise support our Services.\nIn response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena, a law enforcement or government agency's request or similar request.\nWith third parties in order to investigate, prevent, or take action (in our sole discretion) regarding potentially illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to any person, us, or the Services, or violations of our policies, the law or our Terms of Use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Services.\nWe may transfer some or all of your Information if we, or one of our business units, undergoes a business transition, like a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part of our assets, in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, or if a substantial portion of our or of a business unit’s assets is sold or merged in this way.\nWe may share the Information with WarnerMedia companies and Turner Affiliates, so they can provide, improve and communicate with you about their own, or their marketing partners’ products and services. A representative list of Turner Affiliates is available at https://turneraffiliates.turner.com/Affiliates/Turner-Affiliates-English.\nWe may share the Information with unaffiliated Partners and third parties (e.g., advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that wish to market products or services to you. If you wish to opt out from such marketing, please visit the How to Contact Us/Opting Out of Marketing Communications Section below for further instructions.\nWe may share the Information for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect the Information or pursuant to your consent.\nPlease note that the Services covered by this Privacy Policy may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications, or social network integrations) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain information from their visitors. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information, which is subject to their own privacy policies.\n\nCookies and Other Online Tracking Technologies.\nWe use cookies and other technologies both to provide our Services to you and to advertise to you. We also may work with Partners to help them advertise to you when you visit other websites or mobile applications, and to help them perform user analytics. These technologies may also be used by our Partners to collect and analyze information about our Users’ activities on our Services and elsewhere on the Internet (including how our Users interact with advertising), and more generally, to learn more about our Users and what services or offers you might prefer to receive. We describe some of these technologies below.\nCookies.\nTo enhance your online experience, we and our Partners use \"cookies\", \"web beacons\" or other tracking technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. We use cookies or other tracking technologies to understand Service and Internet usage and to improve or customize the products, content, offerings, services or advertisements on our Services. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Services (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a Service), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our Services. We also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to help us offer you products, content, offerings or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising when you visit this Service, a Turner Affiliate’s Service, or when you visit other websites or applications. We or a third party platform with whom we work may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized content, offers, services or advertisements on our Services or other sites. The cookies may be associated with de-identified demographic or other data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.\nWe, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our Partners also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or other networks or Services. This also helps us, our service providers and Partners provide more relevant advertising.\n\nSyncing Cookies and Identifiers.\nWe may work with our Partners (for instance, third party ad platforms) to synchronize unique, anonymous identifiers (such as those associated with cookies) in order to match our Partners’ uniquely coded user identifiers to our own. We may do this, for instance, to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device, and thus enable us or others to send ads that are more relevant, match Users to their likely product interests, or better synchronize, cap, or optimize advertising.\n\nLocally Stored Objects.\nServices on the Turner Network may employ locally stored objects (“LSOs”) and other client side storage tracking technologies in certain situations where they help to provide a better user experience, such as to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies, or in order to target or help our Partners target ads, analyze ad performance, or perform user, website or market analytics. For LSOs utilized by Adobe Flash you can access Flash management tools from Adobe’s website. In addition, some, but not all browsers provide the ability to remove LSOs, sometimes within cookie and privacy settings.\n\nDisabling Cookies\nMost web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of the Services may be difficult to use or inoperable.\n\nWe may work with certain third-party companies that use techniques other than cookies to recognize your computer or device, link your devices, and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity, including those integrated with our Services. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these techniques, and those browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such techniques. To learn more about Interest-Based Advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising by those third parties that are members of DAA’s opt-out program, please go to About Ads.\n\nWeb Beacons.\nWe and our Partners may also use \"web beacons\" or clear GIFs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a Service or in an email, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a Service or email. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that Service. Web beacons may also be used to provide information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns (e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.).\n\nMobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.\nWe also sometimes use, or partner with publishers, publisher-facing, or app developer platforms that use mobile Software Development Kits (“SDKs”), or use an SDK with a mobile app that we offer, to collect Information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., Apple IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and Information connected to how mobile devices interact with our Services and those using our Services. The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services or analytics to be performed. We may use this technology to deliver or help our Partners deliver certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. If you’d like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in the “Your Ad Choices” Section below.\n\nBy visiting the Service, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Service through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we send to you.\n\nOur unaffiliated Partners and third parties may themselves set and access their own tracking technologies when you visit our Services and they may have access to information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites or applications when you use the Service.\n\nYour Ad Choices\nAdvertising enables us to provide the rich content for which Services on the Turner Network are known, and to provide much of this content free of cost to our Users. Thus, we may strive to provide you with ads that are relevant to you and for products you may want.\nWe also offer you choices with regard to interest-based ads. To learn more about interest-based ads and the choices available to you, please visit our Ad Choices website, which has general information about certain companies that place these ads. You may also find more information about entities involved in online advertising and additional choices you may make for companies that participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) at the NAI choice page, and for companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (the “DAA”) at the DAA consumer choice page . To learn more about interest-based ads in mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA’s AppChoices tool, you may download the version of AppChoices for your device here. Turner is a participant in the online industry’s self-regulatory program administered by the DAA and has agreed to adhere to the DAA’s principles applicable to interest-based ads. The tools provided on the Ad Choices website, as well as the DAA opt-out page, the NAI opt-out page, and the AppChoices tool are provided by third parties, not Turner. Turner does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.\nWhen using a mobile application you may receive tailored in-application advertisements. Depending on your device, you may be able to reset your mobile device’s advertising identifier at any time by accessing the privacy settings on your mobile device. In addition, each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact (or review the applicable privacy web page of) the applicable platform operator.\n\nOther Important Information About Your Privacy\n\nHow We Respond to Do Not Track Signals\nAt this time Services on the Turner Network do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include “do not track” instructions.\n\nLinked Services\nSome of the Services may contain links to or integrations with other services such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other media services and platforms whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult these other services' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.\n\nInternational Transfer\nThis Service is governed by and operated in accordance with US law. If you are located outside of the US, you use this Service at your own risk. Turner is a company that operates globally so it is necessary to transfer your Information internationally. In particular, your Information will be transferred to and processed in the United States where many of our central databases operate. By using this Service, you (a) acknowledge that the data protection and other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may provide a less comprehensive or protective standard of protection than those in your country, and consent to your Information being collected, processed and transferred as set forth in this Privacy Policy and US law.\n\nData Security\nWe have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the Information we collect online. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the Information that we collect and store.\nAlthough we take reasonable and appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of Information, we cannot assure you that Information will never be disclosed, altered or destroyed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.\n\nAdditional Information Regarding Children’s Privacy\nDue to the paid membership feature on Boomerang, you must be 18 years of age or older to create a “Registered Account” (as defined in the Terms of Use available at www.boomerang.com/termsofuse) or become a Boomerang subscriber (“Subscriber”). The Service may allow a Subscriber with a Registered Account to establish a child as an authorized User for whom he/she is a parent or legal guardian.  In this case, we require the Boomerang Subscriber to provide any information requested and to agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and any data collection on behalf of any authorized child User. If the Subscriber provides parental consent where required by law, we may use and disclose any personal information collected from the minor child consistent with the rest of this Privacy Policy.  To review our children’s privacy practices for watch.boomerang.com and the video areas of the Boomerang app for children whose parents have not consented or subscribed, please visit www.watch.boomerang.com/privacy\n\nShould we collect and store a child’s personal information, a parent or legal guardian will have the ability to review or request deletion of any of their child’s personal information or refuse to permit its further collection or use. If you are a parent or legal guardian who would like to exercise these rights or has discovered that your child has registered for or accessed Boomerang without your consent, you can ask us to remove any unauthorized information provided by your child by contacting us at privacy.boomerangplus@turner.com or our customer service at support@boomerang.com. Upon valid notice from you, Boomerang will make reasonable efforts to investigate and remove the information. You may be asked to provide customer service with the account email address or username and account password submitted by your child. Please review the Terms of Use for information regarding how to cancel a subscription.\n\nHow You Can Access or Correct Information\nAccess to certain personal Information that is collected from our Services and that we maintain may be available to you. For example, if you created a password-protected account within our Service, you can access that account to review the Information you provided. You may also send an e-mail or letter to the following e-mail or street address requesting access to or correction of your personal Information. Please include your registration information for such Service such as first name, last name and e-mail address in the request. We may ask you to provide additional information for identity verification purposes, or to verify that you are in possession of an applicable email account.\n\nE-mail Administration\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc.\nAttention: Privacy Policy Coordinator - Legal\n1050 Techwood Drive, Atlanta, GA 30318\nemail: privacy.boomerangplus@turner.com\n4O4-878-O694\n\nHow to Contact Us/Opting Out of Marketing Communications\nIf you have any questions or concerns about the online Privacy Policy for this Service or its implementation, or if you would like to opt out from our sharing of your personal Information with unaffiliated third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes (if applicable) you may contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator at the above address or privacy.boomerangplus@turner.com and request that we opt you out of such sharing.

If you have signed up to receive text messages or push notifications from us and no longer wish to receive such messages, you may follow the instructions to stop the delivery of such messages, which may include replying “STOP” to the received text message or change the settings on your device that allow push notifications from Boomerang.\n\nCalifornia Residents – Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia’s \"Shine the Light\" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. As discussed above in How to Contact Us/Opting Out of Marketing Communications, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your personal Information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes or to find out more about your opt-out rights, please contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator as described above.\n\nList of Turner Affiliates.\nBelow is a list of some of the WarnerMedia companies that are affiliated with Boomerang and the Turner group companies and with whom we may share Information we collect at our Services.

That’s not to say that I’m completely satisfied with it. There were a few issues I ran into, and a couple personal complaints that I have. \n\n    So to begin. The downloading was actually pretty good, it was fast and it seemed to work pretty well for me, but there were a few issues I encountered with it. All of the downloaded shows had no images and the names of the episodes were all something random, one of them didn’t even play, and a few of them would freeze at a specific time in the show no matter how many times I tried watching it (I had to skip ahead in the episode to fix it). But other than that I have no complaints about the downloading, it saved me during a long car ride, and it surprisingly takes barely any battery.\n\n   Now on to the personal complaints. I really wish there were more shows. To my knowledge, they literally have the rights to all of these awesome old shows, but for some reason they won’t add them, yeah they got some good shows right now, but where is Dexter’s Lab, Ed Edd n’ Eddy, Chowder, etc. Because if you really think about it, Boomerang is charging us half the price as a Netflix subscription for a medium list of shows that they own the rights to. That’s pretty much my only complaints though. I enjoy a few of the shows on here, and I’m really happy at how easy they are to watch.","title":"Pretty good experience, but...","userName":"Extra Cub"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3612755309","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-01-04T23:02:59Z","developerResponse":{"id":6689756,"body":"Thanks for the kind words and the constructive feedback.

While my review was 4 stars I would say it’s more of a 4.5. I was very skeptical when it was announced given the dive in quality of the Boomerang TV channel. However, I was proven wrong in a big way. The selection is great and growing not to mention the app and  website seem to have been put together really well. It seems like the team working on them real took time and effort to make it a good quality. The only disappointing part is the inconsistency of the downloading feature. Some episodes downloaded correctly while others did not. For example, one episode downloaded but didn’t have any audio. Others simply didn’t want to play. I also think a couple tweaks to the mobile app would be very beneficial. For example, I think adding a downloaded tab that takes you to all of the content you downloaded would be much more convenient than having to scroll to the bottom of the mobile app to find that section. I’m also not the biggest fan of episodes continuously playing whenever I’m scrolling through episodes on the desktop version. It’s not a major deal just something I’m not the biggest fan of. Again, overall it’s been a great experience and if a couple tweaks are made and content is being added regularly I don’t see why this app/service couldn’t become even better.","title":"Really good app with room to improve","userName":"NateK294"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2935645074","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-07-19T18:39:09Z","rating":4,"review":"it sure is nice having a streaming service which allows me to see many of the cartoons I had watched on reruns growing up as a kid, especially since at least some of them are not available for purchase in any format. The annual or monthly subscription rates are very reasonable just for those facts alone. Here is where the app needs some work, it is not completely voiceover compliant, and anyone who has difficulty reading the screen and the information on the icons as I do and probably many other users have, can probably appreciate this issue. what we end up with, is my clicking on a choice and not knowing exactly what I’m about to watch until it comes on the screen, at which point I can recognize it there. But it would be nice to have this app be 100% voiceover compatible, and since I have other streaming services which already have this capability, I know it can be done. If the developers listen to or read this review and correct this issue, I would have absolutely no problem changing my reading to five stars.

The reason I’m giving this app such a low rating is because of all the technical issues I’ve been facing. I love that there is a download feature as I often watch shows on my phone on my commute to work which has little to no service. The downloads feature was working fine at first but once I turned my phone on airplane mode I was unable to start a show. Clicking on the show did nothing unless I had service. The second issue was the downloaded show would randomly stop while I was watching it on airplane mode. Once it stopped I had to back out and start the show from the beginning and hope it would work without stopping. It was hard to finish a single downloaded episode without service. This happened multiple times and I wasn’t able to finish the episode. The final issue occurred while I was watching a downloaded episode without airplane mode on with service coming in and out. The screen went black for a couple of seconds and then crashed. I was unable to open the app again because everyone I tried it crashed. I had to delete the app which deleted all of my downloads. Since downloading episodes only worked some of the time, I am unable to download episodes I haven’t seen yet because I have reached my “two downloads per year” limit. I love that there is a download feature but please fix this as soon as possible and I will purchase a yearly subscription!!!","title":"Please fix downloads","userName":"Joey Boomerang"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2974118066","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-07-26T22:01:37Z","developerResponse":{"id":4428564,"body":"Hi, thanks for sharing your experience.

Sometimes I’ll repeatedly tap download and nothing will happen. Other times downloads will take forever or sometimes the download appeared to be fixed finished only for me to find that it didn’t finish downloading once I get somewhere and want to watch something. I also find downloading movies to be nearly impossible and I haven’t successfully done so yet, which is so disappointing!

The content thus far has been great but I’m hoping more from the “golden age” of H-B Production Company (1958 to 1978) will be added!!

Since their channel on TV is starting to show newer shows, I thought that was the end of Scooby Doo and other old favorites. That’s when this app gave me hope! It’s a great price to subscribe, and it even has movies from some of your favorite old series! It’d be cool to have slightly more content, like 3-5 more shows. Only issue I have is with playing it on chrome cast or my laptop. When casting it, I can’t rewind or fast forward and when watching on my laptop, I don’t always get sound. That, or the sound will continue, while the picture is frozen. It’s weird. Aside from those little bugs, and being eager for slightly more content (I mainly just want some more of the prominent Scooby Doo movies LOL) it’s a great app that any fan of the channel should download.","title":"4 out of 5!","userName":"Traelon"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3323489671","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-10-20T14:45:22Z","developerResponse":{"id":4111312,"body":"Hi there, thank you SO much for the feedback!
