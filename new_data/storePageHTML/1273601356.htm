        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>By first opening the app there are specific types of problems (mental or physical) to talk about in group chats. You can add more specific types of chats and people can join. There are ‘guides’ who monitor the conversation, keep it going and will talk to you with others in the chat and even direct message you if you don’t want all people to see. Even though the live chats are about specific things you can chat a guide or any person in general that’s willing to talk about any situation you might have. <br />Under another tab there are various subjects such as depression, MS, anorexia, child birth and even more mainstream things such as graduating from college, loosing a job, divorce and breakups that give some good advice (I’m bad at explaining just check it out for yourself). These really target specific problems. <br />I suggest everyone get this app. The only thing I don’t like is the Pinterest looking theme under the specific tabs and I also wish they could tell you what the specific thing is about Incase you just want to learn about it (but I guess part of the app is defining that for yourself per your own experience) <br />Overall great.

Wisdo is love, family, listening, and everything community means. By creating connections, whether they are one time interactions or life long friends, whether they are exactly like you or someone you never thought you would get to know, Wisdo creates strength. A platform for the messy, uncomfortable, and embarrassing, this place is full of people radiating positivity just waiting to lift you up. Even when the person you are connecting with can&#39;t provide an perfect answer or say the perfect thing, Wisdo is always, always, always a safe place to just listen and accept with open arms. Because of this place, I went from being depressed and lost to feeling completely supported and knowing I want to help others through counseling, just like the counseling I got here. You deserve all of the support and community that Wisdo gives freely to you. Join in the conversation! We can&#39;t wait to meet you ♥️</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I thought the same thing every one else did when they downloaded this app, that it can help with depression and anxiety and so on, but it was not good what so ever, and I’m warning others to please don’t even try this app, when I used the app I noticed the guides would ignore people, they would choose people to talk to and if they did not like you they would make it so that they had every guide gang up on you, it’s like a clang of bullies, and if some one disagreed with what the guide may have said, then that guide would remove that persons account completely, and if they did not do that then they would comment back in a very rude and abusive way, basically yelling at the individual that disagreed with the guide, and as soon as one guide said some rude things to the person that disagreed, well then the other guides would gang up on that one person, it broke my heart to see the guides doing such disgusting things, and the thing is you can’t block guides so you would just have to sit there and let these people yell in your face, once I deleted it for good, I noticed I started becoming more happy, for real all this app does is cause stress, and is just disgusting, I warned many people I know not to ever get this app, and I’m warning you please do not get this app.</p>

Wisdo is a safe community and is kept that way, by Guides who explain rules of conduct, give a heads up to those breaching the rules and only if all else fails, take action. That said, feel free to write to me directly and I will make sure you were banned justifiably, Boaz (CEO, boaz@wisdo.com)</p>

You can add more specific types of chats and people can join. There are ‘guides’ who monitor the conversation, keep it going and will talk to you with others in the chat and even direct message you if you don’t want all people to see. Even though the live chats are about specific things you can chat a guide or any person in general that’s willing to talk about any situation you might have. \nUnder another tab there are various subjects such as depression, MS, anorexia, child birth and even more mainstream things such as graduating from college, loosing a job, divorce and breakups that give some good advice (I’m bad at explaining just check it out for yourself). These really target specific problems. \nI suggest everyone get this app. The only thing I don’t like is the Pinterest looking theme under the specific tabs and I also wish they could tell you what the specific thing is about Incase you just want to learn about it (but I guess part of the app is defining that for yourself per your own experience) \nOverall great.

Because of this place, I went from being depressed and lost to feeling completely supported and knowing I want to help others through counseling, just like the counseling I got here. You deserve all of the support and community that Wisdo gives freely to you. Join in the conversation!

There shouldn’t ever be a reason you should have to subscribe or make payments for these services. I understand that it costs money and time and effort and all that Jazz to make apps. However, this is free, unsolicited advice from everyday people. Not professionals. There may be some spread throughout the app but this is the generalized public. This is to get help in a way that is supposed to be more comfortable for people. Statistically speaking, people who live in the “middle class” and lower have higher rates of mental illness and higher rates of suicide. The lower you go in poverty level, the higher and higher suicide rates climb and the higher percentage of mental illness. I’m more than willing to bet that a fairly decent amount of people, probably 80% minimum struggle financially and are just trying to get help in one of the only ways they can afford to. I would highly HIGHLY suggest revisiting this option. I know that I can’t afford that extra money right now as every penny counts. Those who read this review it is a great app. Take advantage of the free trial. It’s worth it. But I would suggest writing low star reviews and hopefully the people who made this app will reconsider their fees.","title":"Help shouldn’t Cost","userName":"SkeletonQueen29"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3506415300","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-12-08T05:55:54Z","rating":5,"review":"This is one of the best apps I’ve ever used first off let me tell you, you need to be 17 and up because that’s the rules. Being a rebellious and depressed teen I need this. So I singed in and was like how do I do this. So I started to almond to people who need help and I started to feel better I did not hold back I told people everything about me. I started talk to a young lady and she and I talked and talked and talked and I felt amazing this  is one of the best experiences of my life...but one day no one responded .”that’s weird” I thought but I did not care that much next day came no responses then the next then the next and I thought everyone has forgotten about me and I was getting sad again but then I looked and I got a message saying they found out I was too young and my account suspended but if you liked a  good way to get things off your chest this is the app for you","title":"Why I can’t use this app but I still did","userName":"ty pike"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3831031059","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-03-02T05:04:51Z","rating":5,"review":"I love how helping everyone is on this app. It’s all about supporting each other. Such a wonderful community. Many groups to choose from. You’ll easily connect with people and get to vent. Great for depression and anxiety. I will say the app tends to lag. It doesn’t show messages right away even though someone had already sent the message. Sometimes it takes 2 minutes to load or I’ll need to close and reopen the app. Also sometimes when I type a message it glitches and moves the previous texts up instead of being on what was just previously sent. Also I seem to have a issue with how much text you can type to someone as well. Sometimes the message doesn’t load fully and it gets cut off. \n\nOtherwise the app is amazing.

That being said: this app is not user-friendly; when I click ‘view more replies’ I constantly receive a message with a red bar that says ‘something is wrong’. Additionally, notifications can be slow to appear, and the chat rooms are difficult to keep up with. Part of this results from the largest groups being ridiculously large, but also: when you click to read the chat history, you often can’t find the newest notification that showed up in the preview screen. The timeline ‘trending’ feature also constantly shows the same posts/doesn’t refresh correctly. Please fix the numerous bugs in this app. \n\nLastly: many people try to use this app as a dating site. It’s incredibly irritating, and could potentially be harmful to those seeking help when feeling especially vulnerable. The block feature is a helpful way to get rid of creeps, but it’s disappointing that this is an issue to begin with.","title":"Great concept, not very well executed","userName":"C24601"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5726657115","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-03-28T15:55:25Z","developerResponse":{"id":14462653,"body":"Thank you Croyyyy for your constructive comment.

I left and tried installing it 6-8 months later. Anyways I don’t understand where you are going with payments. I’m not sure if the system has changed since I can’t view unless I pay. I would not use this app anymore if I have to pay to help other people through your app. That seems pretty low, and definitely not something I ever want to be a part of. It doesn’t align with my morals. I hope the people who create groups get paid for it and everyone who actually helps people. I’m sorry but this feels like a slap in the face. I wish you luck in whatever it is you’re trying to achieve, sort of. There is a lack of transparency with categories being locked. It’s as big of a mess as my review because the lack of transparency in the app doesn’t allow me to properly rate Wisdo unless I pay. Clearly I won’t be doing that and will search for better alternatives.

Every single thing I posted was ignored. It just caused me more anxiety because I was already anxious enough about posting it and then literally no one would reply. Some of the guides don’t really seem to care about everyone and only pick specific people to interact with. I also believe that letting people who have been through things help others who are dealing with the same thing is a great idea, however, putting thousands of people together that are all currently dealing with anxiety or depression while they’re trying to help each other isn’t that great. It’s like the blind leading the blind. That’s probably why there are programs that pair someone with someone who has dealt with it or understands and can give advice, rather than someone currently dealing with it. Great idea but not executed properly.
