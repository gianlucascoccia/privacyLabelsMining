Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING &amp; EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.","screenshot":["https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/2f/8b/15/2f8b154d-9e68-f298-7f42-38b9ef7e2e44/1074a082-be08-4f1f-824d-e043f0b94bb8_Screen_1@3x.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/c6/13/7d/c6137d1c-20b0-af99-f9be-3eaef88313cb/eae12214-4de4-4e56-8bfa-7e87fbef81c9_Screen_2@3x.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/b4/57/db/b457dbec-74e8-14cd-493d-022433d0507f/71dbec57-1e41-4652-864e-151eca396e09_Screen_4@3x.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/fa/03/7e/fa037ecc-f505-2621-2557-3adf1c9cfa1f/685b76dd-edca-488d-b2e5-984eb6f7530e_Screen_3@3x.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/56/b4/45/56b445e2-399f-aacf-4555-60390131beae/d3a3a335-2bcf-4d19-bee1-ceb70841c7fd_Screen_5@3x.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/4d/2b/d2/4d2bd271-e858-a7d1-8e21-559b6ff1e7b6/ed68c40c-b7f4-4991-b92f-f3e7ce966556_Screen_6@3x.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/5c/1e/e7/5c1ee7ec-2eee-5d5c-c4c3-306fc34cb094/209b775f-bfdc-4083-91fb-fa0a9b842e0e_Screen_7@3x.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/51/a0/79/51a079b2-52b8-3a86-4294-7de5ef286b2a/3bf9be90-04a6-400a-aaec-f810bab52fc3_Screen_8@3x.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/1b/3a/e6/1b3ae696-1db6-cb68-51fd-ac9ab2ceaecf/59fccb37-c7f6-4118-b6c1-e194e8c20ac4_Screen_9@3x.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource125/v4/64/1b/1e/641b1e42-0c2e-953d-3636-358c4f283905/c79f6bba-f958-4504-824f-52fe77832c12_Screen_10@3x.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/c9/6f/9f/c96f9fd3-ee86-54a2-7b41-35a16d22d886/a1aadcdd-e9e2-4b92-b9da-01632c7bae08_Screen_1@2x.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/d5/da/29/d5da297a-f4d6-4079-40c0-ed31c16e5d25/3ebea52c-154c-4f6e-9a83-8a22b1e97d0c_Screen_2@2x.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/de/39/d3/de39d39d-9cce-c7e4-1afd-011b380d9b00/a1c90bd2-267b-4bfb-8127-24e215ea81f2_Screen_3@2x.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/7e/8b/ab/7e8babe2-cf15-3c52-e0a1-05ce912d3b3b/e7391840-38ed-46cc-b2e2-41731608df4f_Screen_4@2x.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/70/e8/f8/70e8f856-e283-49f9-9755-dd3874b55c08/08b0b4fd-ce85-4a59-a32f-c7b13dde0328_Screen_5@2x.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/df/87/03/df870310-1eb5-1baf-45ff-1a36a29b62f7/2317d9f9-dbeb-4565-a699-a54d18af72c2_Screen_6@2x.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/16/83/07/16830723-fba2-9217-e337-6cab32f990be/d61508b4-8e9d-4444-9d78-13728d6cf9e5_Screen_7@2x.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple125/v4/55/55/53/5555532c-5f63-473f-e284-8bd95c29a83f/36794cd9-44ac-4a34-b87b-51c16130de2d_Screen_8@2x.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/34/1d/a3/341da386-944c-36e4-71e1-3fbf48648ebd/278d1fc9-aebd-4ddf-a4c4-674d07f7f4c1_0_APP_WATCH_SERIES_4_0.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/ee/75/dd/ee75dd5a-36b6-68f3-f1c0-441bbe9f39a9/aa0f2aa0-2a20-4860-b16d-63c9e9a36cf4_1_APP_WATCH_SERIES_4_1.png/300x0w.jpg"],"image":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/d3/4d/73/d34d733d-d2a7-39b0-087d-379855a0b549/AppIcon-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-6-0-sRGB-85-220.png/1200x630wa.png","applicationCategory":"Photo &amp; Video","datePublished":"May 28, 2018","operatingSystem":"Requires iOS 14.0 and watchOS 6.0 or later.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing &amp; editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.<br /> <br />POWERFUL PHOTO EDITING<br />The Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.<br /> <br />RAW SHOOTING &amp; EDITING<br />RAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.<br /> <br />PHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION<br />We have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you&#39;ll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.<br /><br />CAPTURE PRESETS<br />Camera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.<br /><br />As your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you&#39;ll feel at home in Manual mode. You&#39;ll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.<br /><br />Other presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don&#39;t miss the shot.<br /> <br />INTRODUCING MAGIC ML<br />Magic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don&#39;t just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography &quot;pops&quot;! And if you&#39;ve already got photos you&#39;d like to spruce up a bit, we&#39;ve added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you&#39;d like.<br /><br />TOTAL CONTROL<br />If your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.<br /><br />SHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS<br />Use Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.<br /><br />Focus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.<br /><br />DEPTH CAPTURE<br />Depth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Bug fixes and performance improvements.<br /><br />In version 6 we introduced iOS 15, iPhone 13 and Apple Watch 7 adaptations.<br /><br />We&#39;ve significantly sped up the process of starting the camera up and changing presets. We never want you to miss a single moment!<br /><br />The Quality &amp; Format and Save submenus, over the years, have become super streamlined and very short. We also thought it was now a bit confusing as to what belonged where. So we did the logical thing, and merged them into one super submenu called Quality and Save.<br /><br />We&#39;ve added a brand-new shiny widget that you can embed into any home screen, or the dashboard, to give you quick and easy access to your favorite functions, like simply taking a photo or a selfie, viewing your photos, and taking a macro photo.<br /><br />We have several updates to do with RAW, the way it&#39;s handled and its ease of use. iPhone 12 users can now shoot RAW photos using both the Ultra-Wide lens as well as their front camera. <br /><br />RAW is no longer a second class citizen as far as the Photo Library integration is concerned. You can now view your RAW smart album from directly within Camera+ 2.<br /><br />ProRAW is now compatible with saving in TIFF format, and that option will be available to you via our aforementioned brand new Quality and Save menu.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I “upgraded” to a new iPhone 11 max pro and despite the specifications on the camera being theoretically better than my previous XS Max, for the life of me I could not capture an aesthetically pleasing macro shot as I could with the XS Max.<br />I take macro shots daily for my business all day long. This problem was having a huge impact on my work and workflow. I began searching for a camera app that might help and this one nailed it. Even without the myriad of controls you get with this app, simply going into macro mode, using the zoom slider, and visually focusing, you get a beautiful macro shot without the distortions and uneven detail and lighting I was getting with the native camera app. So even if you are not interested in detailed camera exposure controls for example, however useful they may be to you in the future, as a point and click replacement you get a winner with Camera+ 2.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I was in the video production business for 20+ years and I would always shoot photos during our field shooting to help me remember important sequences for the editor. A fast shooting camera was important to me but quality gradually became the top requirement. I use to carry a cumbersome Canon 20D but I was afraid I would damage it when I was moving around the set. <br /><br />Then Apple started including a good, not excellent, quality camera with their iPhones. I started with an iPhone 2 or 3 but now use an iPhone 6s+. It is better than good but not near the quality of the newer iPhones. But the iPhone 6s+ meets my needs. But the Camera App that came with the phone leaves a lot to be desired. A few years ago I found the Camera+ App and with its editing tools provides me with what I need as a basic photographer. I now have upgraded to the newer Camera+ 2 and for me, it is the camera app to go to.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>There’s nothing wrong with the built-in camera app, but Camera+2 is the one I use most often. Since you can set it up to swipe from the left to open the app in 4 different modes, it’s nearly as convenient and much more satisfying to use. Although it’s more complex, the software is so well designed that everything is fast and easy. Take the time to learn how it works before you start using it. I love the way it can outline all the edges that are in focus (if checked) and the macro mode is outstanding on my iPhone 8. I really only bought this to give money to the developers because I used the previous version so much I felt grateful, but this is better in so many ways.</p>

Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects."},"websiteUrl":"http://camera.plus","requiredCapabilities":"arm64 ","offers":[{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=7990\u0026salableAdamId=1313580627\u0026pricingParameters=STDQ\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=844775536","type":"buy","priceFormatted":"$7.99","price":7.99,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":167752704}]},{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=0\u0026salableAdamId=1313580627\u0026pricingParameters=SWUPD\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=844775536","type":"update","priceFormatted":"$0.00","price":0,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":167752704}]}]},"relationships":{"artwork":{"data":{"type":"image","id":"ember67504947"}},"circular-artwork":{"data":{"type":"image","id":"ember67504948"}}}}]},"relatedEditorialItems":{"data":[{"id":"1410000361","type":"media/editorial-item"}]},"reviews":{"data":[{"id":"6181821030","type":"media/review"},{"id":"6140245819","type":"media/review"},{"id":"5897558457","type":"media/review"},{"id":"2972007192","type":"media/review"},{"id":"4045107299","type":"media/review"},{"id":"3227438807","type":"media/review"},{"id":"4196058079","type":"media/review"},{"id":"7301206905","type":"media/review"},{"id":"3293770001","type":"media/review"},{"id":"4018229924","type":"media/review"}],"meta":{"next":"/v1/catalog/us/apps/1313580627/reviews?l=en-US\u0026offset=10"}},"topInApps":{"data":[]},"applewatchScreenshots":{"data":[{"id":"ember67504943","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504944","type":"image"}]},"ipadScreenshots":{"data":[{"id":"ember67504935","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504936","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504937","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504938","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504939","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504940","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504941","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504942","type":"image"}]},"iphoneScreenshots":{"data":[{"id":"ember67504925","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504926","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504927","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504928","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504929","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504930","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504931","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504932","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504933","type":"image"},{"id":"ember67504934","type":"image"}]},"genres":{"data":[{"id":"6008","type":"media/genre"},{"id":"6005","type":"media/genre"}]}}},"included":[{"id":"6181821030","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T16:26:43Z","rating":5,"review":"I “upgraded” to a new iPhone 11 max pro and despite the specifications on the camera being theoretically better than my previous XS Max, for the life of me I could not capture an aesthetically pleasing macro shot as I could with the XS Max.\nI take macro shots daily for my business all day long. This problem was having a huge impact on my work and workflow. I began searching for a camera app that might help and this one nailed it. Even without the myriad of controls you get with this app, simply going into macro mode, using the zoom slider, and visually focusing, you get a beautiful macro shot without the distortions and uneven detail and lighting I was getting with the native camera app. So even if you are not interested in detailed camera exposure controls for example, however useful they may be to you in the future, as a point and click replacement you get a winner with Camera+ 2.","title":"Thank goodness for this app and developer","userName":"TechClock"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6140245819","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-30T14:40:07Z","rating":5,"review":"I was in the video production business for 20+ years and I would always shoot photos during our field shooting to help me remember important sequences for the editor.

I started with an iPhone 2 or 3 but now use an iPhone 6s+. It is better than good but not near the quality of the newer iPhones. But the iPhone 6s+ meets my needs. But the Camera App that came with the phone leaves a lot to be desired. A few years ago I found the Camera+ App and with its editing tools provides me with what I need as a basic photographer.

Unfortunately this app suffers from the exact same issue the previous one did, that of blurry unusable photos (this is post-patch that claims it was fixed) if you choose RAW (on iphoneX). Did multiple tests and it’s definitely an app issue as both the HEIF image are blurry when you turn on RAW, soon as you disable you get sharp photos. From my testing it looks to be a processing issue, which brings up the new issue with this app, that of being frustratingly slow! Moving between elements of the app, switching shooting modes, all are so slow and clunky it makes the app a pain to use. Having paid for both versions now, My take is it is not worth the money to 1.not get reliable use of he advanced features and 2.

Sure there are tons of options, but compare the results of adjusting highlights and shadows in this app to the results you get in something like Lightroom or Snapseed. For whatever reason the “Lab” editing tools just don’t produce as good results. That’s been my experience, anyway.
