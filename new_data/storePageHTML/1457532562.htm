You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min &gt; 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for?

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Learn Korean by speaking from the start!<br />Practice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.<br /><br />===========<br /><br />• &quot;But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”<br /><br />Just like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can&#39;t learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don&#39;t get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida&#39;s first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.<br /><br />• 3 min &gt; 30 min<br /><br />We believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).<br />Why waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.<br /><br />• Overcome fear of speaking<br /><br />Research shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what&#39;s the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can&#39;t speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won&#39;t throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)<br /><br />• What about those other apps?<br /><br />Most apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let&#39;s face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.<br /><br />===========<br /><br />Here’s a list of things that make Teuida different:<br /><br />•  Essential expressions :<br /><br />No more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let&#39;s be honest, when was the last time you had to say &quot;I am a boy, you are a woman&quot; in real-life?)<br /><br />• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:<br /><br />Our crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they&#39;ve been in your shoes!<br /><br />• AI Pronunciation Analysis:<br /><br />What&#39;s the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can&#39;t tell whether you&#39;re pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.<br /><br />• Fun, Interactive Stories:<br /><br />We believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it&#39;s fun! You&#39;ll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.<br /><br />• Real-life Scenarios:<br /><br />Real-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn&#39;t really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)<br /><br />• Culture-specific tips:<br /><br />A wise man once said that &quot;the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool&quot;. We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.<br /><br />So... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!<br /><br />===========<br /><br />Please note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features.</p>

Yup, we got you!<br />2) Can I navigate freely through conversations? Yes you can!<br />3) What about playing back my own voice? Hmm... that one  was a bit hard.... But you bet we did it!<br /><br />All of these awesome features  PLUS a whole new level 1 content!<br /><br />At this rate, it wouldn&#39;t be an overstatement to say Teuida is all about listening, huh?<br /><br />-Team Teuida</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I really like how you speak korean in the all because that forces you to remember certain phrases. the mini lessons also help me remember words. i just wish you didn’t need premium to unlock everything because some of us can’t afford. other than that, amazing app!!<br /><br />edit: <br />i didn’t know how to reach out to you guys but here’s my idea to make it more affordable!! :) my idea is that you can provide coins as a reward. for example if you get maybe an A+ on a quiz then you get 3 coins. you can cash these coins in for another lesson (maybe each lesson can be 15 coins.) not only will it help you to get a lesson but it will motivate you to get more coins (and ultimately do better on quizzes) to get those coins. there could also be alternative ways you can get the coins such as watching maybe a part of a kpop music video or kdrama episode and you would have to use your korean to translate what they said. (given that most kpop and kdrama fans want to learn korean so they want have to use subtitles like me 😂) maybe you guys could also incorporate a “unit test” maybe and you get a bonus 10 coins? or you could complete weekly/daily objectives and get coins as awards. and to keep customers engaged you can have a starter pack for new users that includes 50 coins. i hope you can look into some of these ideas. thanks for being amazing Teudia!! Keep going!! 화이팅! <br />감사합니다 😊</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hey GSWfangurl!<br /><br />Thanks for a stellar review! We&#39;re glad to hear that you found our app helpful. The secret behind long-term memory is this . You read and you definitely forget. You listen and you maybe remember. You speak and you definitely learn! As you correctly pointed out, Teuida forces you to speak as much as possible so that you truly learn the expressions being taught and make it your own! We are working on a model that would make the app more accessible to people who can&#39;t afford it while at the same time keeping us alive to keep creating good content. If you have any ideas of how we could do that sustainably, please reach out to us!<br />Nelson</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I really love this app! I can tell that the developers really care about this app. I am half Korean and I have already studied Korean for over 8 years in a Korean cultural  school. However, I’m still not fluent as most of the school focus was on culture and arts instead of language. I am already okay at Korean but I have trouble remembering certain words. However this app helps me a lot with this. There are so many lessons and levels. I’ve never seen an app like this where you can talk in real life scenarios this way. It’s great and I would recommend this to any beginners, as I recognized most of these and will definitely be helpful to others. My only suggestions are to add more breaks to speak in the video as there isn’t really that much speaking points in it compared to how many video there is. But that’s it, this app is amazing and I love how in touch the developers are to improve this app. I hope that there are more apps like this one for different languages like Japanese!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Ok so I’m gonna give some real conservative criticism here for this app. First of all I think this is a beautiful app. It’s so well constructed and unique. The teachers are great and the videos are really engaging. With that being said I noticed some inconsistencies in the ui. When I complete a lesson there is no green check mark. I have to close the app and reopen it to get the check mark to show up.   Also at the part where the teacher gives a quiz, they ask “how do you say....?” and there is a fill-in-the-blank box, under that box sometimes there’s romanization under it, sometimes Hangul, sometimes English. Why does it keep changing? Why is this not consistent across the app? And more importantly why is the answer shown on screen when it’s supposed to be a quiz??? I really wish the answer wasn’t there so I could actually test myself. Also, I’m sorry but I think that at this time there is too little content to justify the price. The levels are really quick to finish. You can finish everything that’s available in one or two days. I feel like you should have waited until the app was full of content to release it or to start charging so much. I’ll check back later when there’s more chapters available. And please.. add a placement test at the beginning so I know what level to start at. Not everyone needs to start at level 1.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Nikki :)First of all, thank you so much for your constructive criticism! Our team at Teuida is constantly working on improving our app and it&#39;s thanks to users like you that the app is what it is right now!We appreciate the kind words about the unique design, great teachers, and engaging conversation videos.Let me address your concerns one by one.1) Green Check Mark: We&#39;re not sure why this is happening to your phone. Could you please send us a screen recording of this happening to support@teuida.net? We would love to figure this out as it&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve heard this issue.2) Hint showing up in Hagul and English: Definitely agree with you on this one. There&#39;s no point in showing you the answer in a quiz that is meant to challenge and test your knowledge! We&#39;re working on adding a feature to [tap to show hint] instead. We&#39;re still not sure whether the hint should be in hangul or english or romanization. Any ideas on this? This is the reason we mixed it up a bit in the app.3) Too Little Content - We wish there was more content as well and a lot of people have been asking to add more content. Because we are an app that teaches everything through videos rather than auto-translated texts and images, it takes us a lot more resource and time to produce each content! The last thing we want to do is to compromise on the quality of the content and just mass produce subpar content just to make it seem like we have a lot of content. We have kept to our promise of updating one new chapter a week but hopefully we&#39;ll be able to speed that up. 4) Placement TestThis is a great idea! Most of our users are beginners/intermediate so we thought starting from the beginning wouldn&#39;t be a problem but down the road, when we have more contents, this is definitely something we&#39;ll consider. I&#39;m adding it to our ideas board right now!Thanks again for your thoughtful review! and please don&#39;t hesitate to write us at support@teuida.net if you have any more feedback. We love hearing from users like you.Nelson</p>

You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min \u003e 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for?

(given that most kpop and kdrama fans want to learn korean so they want have to use subtitles like me 😂) maybe you guys could also incorporate a “unit test” maybe and you get a bonus 10 coins? or you could complete weekly/daily objectives and get coins as awards. and to keep customers engaged you can have a starter pack for new users that includes 50 coins. i hope you can look into some of these ideas. thanks for being amazing Teudia!!

I can tell that the developers really care about this app. I am half Korean and I have already studied Korean for over 8 years in a Korean cultural  school. However, I’m still not fluent as most of the school focus was on culture and arts instead of language. I am already okay at Korean but I have trouble remembering certain words. However this app helps me a lot with this. There are so many lessons and levels. I’ve never seen an app like this where you can talk in real life scenarios this way. It’s great and I would recommend this to any beginners, as I recognized most of these and will definitely be helpful to others. My only suggestions are to add more breaks to speak in the video as there isn’t really that much speaking points in it compared to how many video there is. But that’s it, this app is amazing and I love how in touch the developers are to improve this app. I hope that there are more apps like this one for different languages like Japanese!","title":"Easy and helpful","userName":"vanessaoverwatch"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6491149365","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-02T06:52:47Z","developerResponse":{"id":18290737,"body":"Nikki :)First of all, thank you so much for your constructive criticism! Our team at Teuida is constantly working on improving our app and it's thanks to users like you that the app is what it is right now!We appreciate the kind words about the unique design, great teachers, and engaging conversation videos.Let me address your concerns one by one.1) Green Check Mark: We're not sure why this is happening to your phone. Could you please send us a screen recording of this happening to support@teuida.net? We would love to figure this out as it's the first time we've heard this issue.2) Hint showing up in Hagul and English: Definitely agree with you on this one. There's no point in showing you the answer in a quiz that is meant to challenge and test your knowledge! We're working on adding a feature to [tap to show hint] instead. We're still not sure whether the hint should be in hangul or english or romanization. Any ideas on this? This is the reason we mixed it up a bit in the app.3) Too Little Content - We wish there was more content as well and a lot of people have been asking to add more content. Because we are an app that teaches everything through videos rather than auto-translated texts and images, it takes us a lot more resource and time to produce each content! The last thing we want to do is to compromise on the quality of the content and just mass produce subpar content just to make it seem like we have a lot of content. We have kept to our promise of updating one new chapter a week but hopefully we'll be able to speed that up. 4) Placement TestThis is a great idea! Most of our users are beginners/intermediate so we thought starting from the beginning wouldn't be a problem but down the road, when we have more contents, this is definitely something we'll consider. I'm adding it to our ideas board right now!Thanks again for your thoughtful review! and please don't hesitate to write us at support@teuida.net if you have any more feedback. We love hearing from users like you.Nelson","modified":"2020-10-06T03:04:26Z"},"rating":3,"review":"Ok so I’m gonna give some real conservative criticism here for this app. First of all I think this is a beautiful app. It’s so well constructed and unique. The teachers are great and the videos are really engaging. With that being said I noticed some inconsistencies in the ui. When I complete a lesson there is no green check mark. I have to close the app and reopen it to get the check mark to show up.   Also at the part where the teacher gives a quiz, they ask “how do you say....?” and there is a fill-in-the-blank box, under that box sometimes there’s romanization under it, sometimes Hangul, sometimes English. Why does it keep changing? Why is this not consistent across the app? And more importantly why is the answer shown on screen when it’s supposed to be a quiz??? I really wish the answer wasn’t there so I could actually test myself. Also, I’m sorry but I think that at this time there is too little content to justify the price. The levels are really quick to finish. You can finish everything that’s available in one or two days. I feel like you should have waited until the app was full of content to release it or to start charging so much. I’ll check back later when there’s more chapters available. And please.. add a placement test at the beginning so I know what level to start at.

I enjoy the concept of learning realistic dialogue instead of learning how to say things that aren’t necessarily useful. I also enjoy the instructors, they give a clear understanding and great guide to proper Korean pronunciation, I appreciate that. Now, there are some little things that I would change if I was a developer for this application. I do not mind the ads because I know the company, developers, and teachers work very hard and need support; but I do think they are a bit excessive. I think there should be a bit more structure when it comes to the levels and lessons: For example, have the learner complete the lesson first with a high grade before being able to access the dialogue. Also, if a learner doesn’t have premium, they should be given a timer on when they can access their next learning session.

Whenever I learn languages, I am always too nervous to speak but this app helps with that so much, especially since speaking a language is probably the best way to practice and retain things. However, the only thing I had a problem with while using the app was that sometimes it won’t pick up what I say or it will say I’m wrong before I even say anything at all. Just recently, I had an experience where it took a minute or more just to tell me if I said a portion of a phrase correctly. I closed the app a couple of times and still had the problem, I even deleted and re downloaded the app and it still was acting the same way. Also, sometimes the app would force close on its own.

There does seem to be a few things that could use a bit if twerking for consumer pleasure. First would be the time given to say the sentences. I understand that native Korean speakers do talk fast and won’t wait forever for you to answer but 3 seconds to respond is not enough time. This goes especially for longer sentences which seem to get the same time as shorter sentences. This results in very jumbled and stumbled over words which leads to the system missing words because of rushing which isn’t that helpful. It also seems (for me at least) that the app cant handle everything and sometimes crashes, so the stability needs a bit of work as well. But overall this is a really good app and hope the developers can make it bigger, better, and has more content in the future. 화이팅! 💪🏽💪🏽😊","title":"A great app, buts may need some adjustments","userName":"Maddy with an issue"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6308680401","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-08-12T02:36:19Z","developerResponse":{"id":17279208,"body":"Hey there!\n\nThanks for sharing! We believe that speaking is the best way (and perhaps the only way) to improve speaking. But we realize that that's not always possible because there simply may not be opportunities to meet with Korean friends and/or getting Korean tutors and classes can be expensive! Also covid. That's why we made this app. Exactly for people like you. We're glad to hear that you LOVE the app and it helps you with speaking and listening.

My goals are to be able to have comfortable conversations with Korean native speakers. However, there are almost none in my area and I am 14 so getting tutors or classes would be difficult do to my parents not having enough money because I’m preoccupied with other things. I have tried apps like hello talk but I find most people my age aren’t really interested in language. I would like to say I LOVE this app. It’s nice to have a resource for learning that is just focused on speaking and listening. I really like what I see so far and in the future I would like to see what comes next. \n\nI really recommend this app for people like me who have learned Korean but are only comfortable in reading and writing. Or people who are starting out and want to have a strong foundation in speaking.

First of all, thank you so much for your thorough review. Our small team is always looking for ways to improve the app and help the user's Korean learning so it's really meaningful to us when you share your thoughts. It sounds like the biggest issue at hand is the fact that there's not much provided for the free users. We've received a lot of requests from people who were not able to afford the Premium. Our team discussed many ideas and decided to release one free chapter for free users every 24 hours! Hope you give that a try and tell us what you think. There are some ads you have to watch but we thought it was a good tradeoff. Thank you for seeing the potential in our app and for suggesting little games for review! We're working on having some kind of a review for sure! Thank you so so so much and please don't hesitate to contact us at support@teuida.net if you have any other suggestions/comments/questions. - Nelson","modified":"2021-04-09T05:32:18Z"},"rating":4,"review":"So far, this app is very helpful! I like that it takes you through pronunciation step by step and that it repeats it. I enjoy that it includes multiple examples for each thing as well, rather than just saying “I am (name),” it also includes “I am a student.” There is one thing that I do not particularly enjoy, I wish there was more things for the people using the free version. I understand why they have more on premium, but it is very upsetting to learn that there is only one lesson available for free users. There is no other review besides that one lesson, which is not super helpful to some users. Overall this app is very good and helpful and it has a lot of potential. I would love to see some more free content added and maybe a game or two for review and memorization, rather than just mini quizzes and the active response videos. Keep up the good work, can’t see what the future holds for this app!! :)","title":"Helpful, but limited","userName":"Zebra

essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min \u003e 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for?
