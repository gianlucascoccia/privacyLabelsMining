It tells you exactly how your drum head is tuned.\nThis DRUM TUNER helps you to get rid of the guesswork of clearing lug pitches drums by ear. It empowers you to tune your drums to a consistent sound. Time after time.\n\nFor less than the cost of a pair of drumsticks, you pocket the most complete drummer-multi tool available today!\nDrumtune PRO not only is an ultra-fast drum tuner with pitch detection in the widest tuning range on iOS!\nIf that's not enough, it also hosts a FULL KIT interval calculator, stores your tuning presets, and is packed with a wicked recorder &amp; metronome!\n\nDrumtune PRO on your phone is like pocketing a personal drum-tech! \n  \n○○○ DRUM TUNER ○○○\nBASIC tuner is handy for a straightforward clearing of your drum heads at the spot where you like'm to be.\nPRESET tuner is more advanced. Take your time to get the hang of it. \nOnce mastered, preset tuner mode helps to understand how the pitch relationship between the drum heads creates a certain timbre dynamic &amp; playing feel! \n\n○○○ KIT INTERVAL CALCULATOR ○○○\nDefine and experiment with tuning intervals between all drums in your kit to let your full kit sound like a balanced set.\n\n○○○LUG TUNER MODE○○○\nLug tuner mode assists you with tuning your lugs in the correct pattern. \nIt keeps track of all lug pitch differences, so you can check which rods have to be tuned up or down to clear your drum head.\n\n○○○ CREATE YOUR SIGNATURE DRUM SOUND ○○○\nFollow estimated tuning targets for batter &amp; reso that get you +/- 10% close to your target fundamental tone as a starting point.\n\nExplore your sound beyond the suggested targets in all freedom.\nWe encourage you to listen carefully to your drum sound.\nExperiment with fundamental tones. \nTweak the pitch relationship between both heads to your own needs! Create a 'drum sound' that fits your style. \n\nOnce you found your 'signature drum sound', measure the pitches of your batter and resonant head.  Override the estimates and replace them with your own pitches to store your own sound in a preset so that you can consistently tune to your sound.\n\n○○○ TUNING PRESETS ○○○\nStore the tuning of your snares, kicks, toms &amp; floor toms in customizable tuning presets. \nWhenever/wherever you need to tune again to the same sound, just load your customized tuning preset to precisely recreate that exact same 'signature drum sound' within minutes. \nTune to a consistent drum sound conveniently and reliably: perfect for gigs, studio work, and rehearsals.\n\n•Cloud-backup/restore presets, excl. recorded sounds!\n•Free drum head expansion packs (Evans, Remo &amp; Aquarian)\n•Organize/Manage drum kits\n\n○○○ PITCH DIFFERENCE SCALE ○○○\nDisplay the difference between your actual pitch and the target pitch.\n(In Cents &amp; in Hz) \nFine-tune your drum precisely.\n\n○○○ METRONOME ○○○\nFull-fledged metronome on board!\n•Odd and even meter selection\n•Tap, type or adjust BPM 1-400 BPM\n•Subdivisions\n•Upbeat &amp; downbeat sound libraries\n•Training modes volume selections\n•Volume &amp; Panning settings\n\n\n○○○SPECIFICATIONS○○○\nTUNER \n&gt; Tune to target notes/pitches (Hz/Note)\n&gt; Fast &amp; powerful tuning algorithm for accurate pitch difference detection per 0.5 Hz step. (Cents/Hz)\n&gt; Tune-up/down indication\n&gt; Tuning range +/- 30 Hz-450 Hz\n\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS\n&gt; iOS 10 or newer\n&gt; Runs on iPhone 5 &amp; newer\n&gt; Will NOT run on: iPhone 4S &amp; older, iPads &amp; iPods\n\nSUPPORT\nWe improve Drumtune PRO based on your input! \n&gt; Email: support@drumtunepro.com\n&gt; FB message: www.facebook.com/DrumtunePRO\n&gt; Direct: Shake your phone to report bugs!\n\nNOTE:\nDon't over-tighten drum heads!\nPitches of a drum head tuned beyond the tuning range limit may cause erratic/'jumpy' readings displayed as random frequencies below 450 Hz.\nSo, in case your snare's resonant head is tuned beyond 450 Hz, the app may show an erratic pitch below 450 Hz.\n\n","screenshot":["https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/8b/e2/d6/8be2d6ee-f274-d3bb-ec6b-f441d9eb2f9a/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/1b/f4/10/1bf4107d-5aac-d99c-2a34-a9e27ac46182/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/97/59/59/975959bb-7b6a-34d4-427d-04bf19b0e6ed/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/83/53/25/8353250f-e867-21d7-e567-ed24f2fc8498/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/5b/81/2b/5b812bdc-d542-d651-12c0-18bbf01bd093/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/ab/37/2e/ab372efd-fb51-453f-e2ca-86b1cad7a7fc/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/8f/fc/76/8ffc767f-6600-f6b9-55aa-25c600517e41/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/f2/29/50/f2295062-094d-5fbe-d086-b68276c12efc/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/74/fb/6c/74fb6ceb-0411-8b60-23f8-2ce9b69ac7e7/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/f3/e2/4e/f3e24e53-8326-59c5-2c81-1c9c53611592/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg"],"image":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/82/f5/72/82f57218-21a3-40a7-d083-0594ee05212b/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-5-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/1200x630wa.png","applicationCategory":"Music","datePublished":"Jun 5, 2013","operatingSystem":"Requires iOS 10.1 or later.

    Mostly great... but tuning can be tricky

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Pretty much everything about this app is great as far as the organization of your various drums and their settings/intervals.<br /><br />However, the actual tuning function is useless for me. I tap near a lug and the app says I’m -7Hz, tap again in the same location with the same force and it says +21Hz, tap again -6Hz, tap again +18Hz...<br /><br />I’ve watched every single video and read the tips, but nothing I try will allow me to consistently tune any of my drums.<br /><br />Oh well, I will still use the app because I like how I can catalog my drums and store their preferred settings. But for the actual tuning I will have to find another solution.<br /><br />Update: Developer has since uploaded extra training videos and I feel more confident in the app’s ability to accurately tune. The more I use the app the better I understand how it responds to tuning and overtones, etc. Although I do wish the app had the ability to detect wild pitch readings between hits and perhaps pop up with potential reasons/solutions for the readings.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Update: Thank you for updating your review and also thank you for your nice suggestion with regards to the pop-up... (We&#39;ll play with that suggestion for a while to see what we can come-up with.) We&#39;re glad that the extra information has been useful. Also nice to hear you get better results, now you&#39;re more familiar with overtones and how to use the app with regards to them. If you have any questions or suggestions about the app, free to reach out to support. A Happy NY!<br />Previous response: &quot;<br /><br /><br />Thanks for the compliments with regards to the organization of presets! <br />However, the tuner should work great too!  Therefore, please reach out to support@drumtunepro.com, and allow us to jump-in with feedback where needed. You didn&#39;t contact us, but we&#39;re sure you will get perfect tuning results!  <br /><br />Since you say the app&#39;s tuning function is useless for any of your drums, please check the following videos of how the app works next to another tuning solution, and how it can deal with overtones when they are present: ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaGBRrzLiWk )<br /><br />To show how to get consistent results, also check this video, wherein a drum is tuned to a certain tone, and thereafter detuned fully in a completely uneven manner, and then tuned again to the same tone to get a consistent and repeatable end-sound: <br /> ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHVbiF1O92k&amp;t=64s ) <br /><br />In general, it seems you may have gotten some overtone interference when detecting a lug pitch. These over-tones are physically present in the timbre of a drum sound. While this interference can be annoying, depending how the app is used, it deals with these overtones properly without interferrence, as you can clearly see in the videos above. If you&#39;re tuning a head within the tuning range, it&#39;s probably solved by a small tweak to the usage flow, therefore we would like to have the opportunity to offer support and get you going, when you contact us. Thanks so much!&quot;</p>

    Best way to tune my drums
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Since using the Drumtune Pro app, my drums have sounded their absolute best. I can select pitches for each drum, even intervals, etc. plus store it all.  I especially like the organizational functions for creating various tuning presets. I create my own, but you can download more options. I play Gretsch USA Customs, drums known for “That Great Gretsch Sound”.  This app helps me get that sound I listen for. <br />Once you learn how the program works, it becomes a more and more useful tool. It takes time to learn and understand what it does and why. It’s great when I change heads and need to re-tune to the same fundamental pitch. Fast.<br /><br />UPDATE from customer:  Why drummers should jump on the Drumtune Pro app:  I just bought a second set of Gretsch USA drums and used the Drumtune Pro to tune them up. I’ve used the app for many months, having discarded other tuners that weren’t nearly as useful. Having already learned how to effectively use the app (users must understand overtones), I was able to tune up the new kit in minutes!  I used the same tonal settings as my other kit to compare the results. A perfect match!  <br />This app is as good as $100 tuners using similar technology and saving me 90% of the cost.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Thank you very much for the review, Keikitc!<br />We are happy to hear the app comes in handy to make your drums sound at their best. <br />It&#39;s a pleasure to hear that you create your own &#39;customized&#39; tuning presets. (While the app offers built-in tuning suggestions as a reference point to get one started, the ultimate goal of the app is to be a useful tuning aid that assists drummers in exploring the sound potential of their drums.) While the app helps to keep track of pitches visually, a drummer can tweak the heads, listen to the effect &amp; make tuning decisions based upon how the drum sound is affected.  Once a good sound is found, the tuning you have created can be stored as lug pitches per head in a custom tuning preset, so it&#39;s easy to tune-up to that exact sound fast. It&#39;s nice to know that you use the app that way! Enjoy Drumtune PRO &amp; Thanks again for the thumbs-up! </p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is one of the most excellent tools a drummer could come across, even if you are only getting to know your drums you will instantly learn the fundamental frequency range of each of your toms, as well as the correlating musical note(s), sound engineers love it when you walk in with a kit and can communicate like this (if they have the time, LOL). You can also send your resonant head frequencies to someone who may tune your kit b4 you get to where you are going. I sent one of my non-drummer friends some fundamental freqs to tune a kit he just purchased for his space, then told him to download the app and how to use it. The next day he sent a video of his kit sounding good enough for any drummer to play on it. -My only complaint is it wasn’t available when I was a kid….but neither were cell phones, LOL! Thanks for this!<br />Dave Weidenhoffer</p>

This app helps me get that sound I listen for. \nOnce you learn how the program works, it becomes a more and more useful tool. It takes time to learn and understand what it does and why. It’s great when I change heads and need to re-tune to the same fundamental pitch. Fast.\n\nUPDATE from customer:  Why drummers should jump on the Drumtune Pro app:  I just bought a second set of Gretsch USA drums and used the Drumtune Pro to tune them up. I’ve used the app for many months, having discarded other tuners that weren’t nearly as useful. Having already learned how to effectively use the app (users must understand overtones), I was able to tune up the new kit in minutes!

You mention 2 main topics: 1) you get a jumpy reading sometimes. 2) The state of the sustain slider isn’t saved? \n\n1)  OVERTONES Jumpy readings are caused by overtones. These overtones can sometimes interfere and cause a jumpy reading, which is a normal phenomenon when using a pitch based- tuner to tune a drumhead. Understanding overtones takes a while, and the app has built-in features that let you deal with them. \n\nThe jumpy readings  are not related to the mic quality. The mic quality of an iPhone is VERY GOOD. \nThese overtones are always present in the drumsound, and therefore sometimes they interfere with the lug pitch-reading.\n\nHOW TO DEAL WITH OVERTONES?\nWhen it happens in basic tuner mode, you can avoid interference by activating LOCK TARGET, on the right lug pitch, once you detected it. \nIf you encounter a lug that gives a jumpy reading, just detect the right lug pitch from another lug that gets the correct result and then press LOCK TARGET”. Now it will read the jumpy lug correctly. \n\nEdge mode in the preset tuner also deals with overtones. In edge mode you can activate LUG FOCUS to deal with overtones, once you’re close to your target tone.\n\nTIP: When detecting lug pitches you can place the drum on a flat surface, like a table top or a floor. This can help in detecting the right pitch.\n\n2) STATE OF INTERVAL SWITCH\nWhen you edit a”Tuning preset” (Pencil icon at the right side of any tuning preset in your MY DRUMS list) you can select a sustain setting for your drum, that controls the estimates for how far both heads are tuned apart, for a given fundamental.)\nDo you mean that this switch doesn’t keep its state when you press the SAVE Button after selection?\n\nPlease let me know via support@drumtunepro.com, I will provide support and fix any issue you may encounter, or help with tips about the app, if helpful.\n\nThanks in advance for reaching out!\n\n","modified":"2020-03-10T01:05:19Z"},"rating":3,"review":"Pretty good app, just recently started using, but I’m having issues with it.

Also when I adjust the settings in the interval settings, it won’t save the option I picked which is a bummer because I don’t like my batter and reso tuned to the same pitch.

Much obliged.\nEnjoy Drumtune PRO! \n\n\nPREVIOUS REVIEW REPLY: Hi Haley, \nThe lug pitches on a snare drum are tuned way beyond 200 Hz, and the fundamental tone should be way beyond 85 Hz as well.\nFor example for a 14\" snare, a fundamental tone of 130Hz would be really 'hollow-low', while a fundamental tone of 260Hz would be rather 'choked-high'.\n\nFor a 14\" snare, for many musical genres, the typical fundamental tones would be situated in a 160 Hz-240 Hz (ballpark) range, on average. \n(A fundamental tone of 220 Hz can be already quite 'punchy' high, and has some reasonably direct/aggressive bite to it.)\n\nYou have also contacted support by email in addition to this review. Thanks so much! \nWe appreciate that a lot because it allows us to provide input by email and ensure you'll get jump-started.\n\nThe readings you get are depending on whether the app is used correctly or not. (At first sight, based upon what you describe, it seems you may have been using lock target wrongly. But we'll find it out via email support...)\n\nIf you are completely new to pitch-tuning, intervals, etc. , it takes a while to get the hang of the app, as first, you must grasp the principles behind how the same fundamental tone can be reached with different pitch relationships of both heads and what effect it has on the feel, the sustain of the fundamental tone in the ring, and the timbre thereof. \n\nEspecially when tuning snare drum resonant heads, overtones are present as the head is very thin and tuned high.\nTherefore, tuning a snare drum's reso head with a pitch-based tuner could be a bit more tricky and requires a bit more 'practice' than, say a tom's reso head.\n\nLet's check what you have been doing together. We may be able to jump in with some tips to get you top-notch results.
