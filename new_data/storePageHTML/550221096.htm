        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>First, the app content is good. <br /><br />My issue/frustration is with the functionality of the app itself. My biggest pain point (and it’s a big one for me) is that the app times out quickly and the video closes, especially whenever my iPad screen times out. So, say I hit Pause on a video for more than a minute or two and/or step away from my iPad long enough for the screen to lock, when I return, I have to reopen STARZ, and re-navigate to the video I was watching from the STARZ home screen. This also occurs when I switch between apps. Whenever STARZ is temporarily moved to the background, I have to search all over again. This is the only app I’ve encountered that does this, making it especially noticeable. Also, other apps have the PIP “drawer” functionality where you can slide a video off screen and return to it. This is not the case in STARZ... the video disappears, and again, if it has been a significant amount of time, I have to re-navigate back. <br /><br /> It’d be nice to have quicker access to the main menus, and to time out on the active content’s description screen (but keep the video window open if in PIP mode).</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’m under 40 so I watch everything on my phone through the app. I will watch a show on the STARZ app; I’m 15-minutes into an episode. Then I will have to pause it just to check something really quick. If I stay paused too long it totally clears the show out. When I’m done with what I’m doing and go back to the app—- I’ve been put back at the stars main page.🙄 Shockingly - there is NO quick access thumbnails of my recently viewed shows listed on the main page. So I have to scroll and search for my show again. Once I click on it. It starts the entire show episode over 🥴😳🙄sooooo I think.🥱 It’s actually playing the PREVIOUS episode i watched and it’s starting it from the beginning!!!😳😳. Like even Before the previews/ advertisements. Then it starts playing and in order to get to the next episode you have to fast forward all the way through that episode. the app makes the entire experience very unappealing to go back to watch a show when it puts you back At The beginning previous episode? It’s like why even bother. I quit my trial. Any company who this innovative and progressive in the content it provides but doesn’t bother putting any effort into the manner in which the content is delivered because they assume(Wrongly) that most are watching this on TV when the fact of the matter is statistically most Americans are watching this on the telephone. Therefore the app working is vital. Netflix knows that, HBO knows that, and so should STARZ.</p>

This Privacy Policy will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.  All controversies, disputes or claims arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy will be determined pursuant to the mediation and arbitration procedures of JAMS, and administered by JAMS or its successor (\"JAMS\") in accordance with the comprehensive rules and procedures, including the optional appeal procedure, of JAMS (\"JAMS Rules\"), as modified by this Privacy Policy.  The parties will endeavor first to attempt to resolve the controversy or claim through mediation administered by JAMS before commencing any arbitration.  All mediation and arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles County, California.  The arbitration will be held before a single neutral arbitrator.  The JAMS Rules for selection of mediators and arbitrators will be followed, except that the mediator or arbitrator will be an experienced entertainment or labor or employment arbitrator licensed to practice law in California, or a retired judge.  Any appellate panel will consist of three (3) neutral members, subject to the foregoing requirements.  Any mediation and/or arbitration will be confidential (except as information may be required in any judicial proceeding brought to enforce these arbitration provisions or any award rendered hereunder).  Upon conclusion of any arbitration proceedings hereunder, the arbitrator will render findings of fact and conclusions of law and a written opinion setting forth the basis and reasons for any decision he or she has reached and will deliver such documents to each party to the agreement along with a signed copy of the award.  Any arbitration award will be final and binding upon the parties.  Judgment upon an award rendered by an arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets.  The arbitrator will have the right to award money damages and other appropriate relief, consistent with the terms of this agreement; however, the arbitrator will not have the right to award injunctive relief against either party or to certify a class action of any kind.  Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy, must be filed within one (1) year of the relevant events. You and Starz agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.\t\n\n20.\tMISCELLANEOUS.

My biggest pain point (and it’s a big one for me) is that the app times out quickly and the video closes, especially whenever my iPad screen times out. So, say I hit Pause on a video for more than a minute or two and/or step away from my iPad long enough for the screen to lock, when I return, I have to reopen STARZ, and re-navigate to the video I was watching from the STARZ home screen. This also occurs when I switch between apps. Whenever STARZ is temporarily moved to the background, I have to search all over again. This is the only app I’ve encountered that does this, making it especially noticeable. Also, other apps have the PIP “drawer” functionality where you can slide a video off screen and return to it. This is not the case in STARZ... the video disappears, and again, if it has been a significant amount of time, I have to re-navigate back. \n\n It’d be nice to have quicker access to the main menus, and to time out on the active content’s description screen (but keep the video window open if in PIP mode).","title":"App Review, Not Content (device iPad Pro)","userName":"faith4vincera"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7555832693","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-07-09T06:10:08Z","rating":3,"review":"I’m under 40 so I watch everything on my phone through the app. I will watch a show on the STARZ app; I’m 15-minutes into an episode.

When I’m done with what I’m doing and go back to the app—- I’ve been put back at the stars main page.🙄 Shockingly - there is NO quick access thumbnails of my recently viewed shows listed on the main page. So I have to scroll and search for my show again. Once I click on it. It starts the entire show episode over 🥴😳🙄sooooo I think.🥱 It’s actually playing the PREVIOUS episode i watched and it’s starting it from the beginning!!!😳😳. Like even Before the previews/ advertisements. Then it starts playing and in order to get to the next episode you have to fast forward all the way through that episode. the app makes the entire experience very unappealing to go back to watch a show when it puts you back At The beginning previous episode? It’s like why even bother. I quit my trial. Any company who this innovative and progressive in the content it provides but doesn’t bother putting any effort into the manner in which the content is delivered because they assume(Wrongly) that most are watching this on TV when the fact of the matter is statistically most Americans are watching this on the telephone.

Really keeps me entertained and wanting to find out what happens next!\n\n I only have one issue with the app which I wish could be resolved. When I go onto any other app such as Netflix or Disney Plus I could watch a show on the TV, and then later or the next day go onto my phone and go back to where I left off, and then back to TV, and so on and so forth. With this app I will go onto my phone and it does not do that. \n\nFor example, I am now watching Black Sails, when I went onto my phone the other day and opened the app, I selected my account, and it didn’t even show where I left off at, and it showed that I was still watching Outlander when I finished that show months ago. Something isn’t syncing from watching the app on the TV, to the phone, or to the computer. I wish that this issue was resolved, cause sometimes when I’m sitting in a waiting room or somewhere I just want to pull out my phone, plug in my headphones and watch the show or movie I’m on, and where I left off at. Also, when I  searched Black Sails on my phone, it showed that none of the episodes were watched, so it’s not just where I left off at, it’s also not registering that I’ve seen any of it at all. Please fix this glitch, it will make me very happy!","title":"Starz Review","userName":"silvermistnina"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7058936413","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-03-03T04:18:14Z","rating":5,"review":"Right now, I’m watching American gods. I’m in love with the show, but I’m worried. Let me explain why: \nI first got involved with STARZ for the show Spartacus. A show I often describe to people who have never seen it as “gods gift to men who watch tv” the death of Andy was tragic, and no one could ever fill his roll, but the fallowing “gods of the arena” was excellent. “War of the dammed” was epic and by then Ian had really stepped into the character of Spartacus. We all knew it had to end sometime, but I wanted so much more than what I got. The same go’s with “black sails” as amazing as it was, it felt short. The subject matter was there. Blackbeard, long John silver. It could have kept going. And don’t get me started on “ash vs the evil dead” I understand that the show was a victim of piracy, but the fan base was there. Canceling that show made STARZ weaker as a service. I’m not interested in “power” definitely not “p-valley” I know “outlander” is a popular show, but it’s not for me. Right now,  for me “American gods” is carrying the subscription. Please don’t cancel it. And I’d like to see more shows like it.","title":"The best, short lived","userName":"spam365"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6577229296","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-26T21:20:40Z","rating":4,"review":"I hold large, multi billion dollar companies to very high standards and this app really misses the mark. The actual content is great, I’ve had plenty of hours of entertainment. Its always on in the background when I do just about anything. With that being said, I really wish it would offer split screen. Since iOS14 came out, almost all of my video apps will go to the corner or run in the background while I use my phone. This app doesnt and its sooo annoying. Currently, the Seduction series is airing and Im super anxious! its amazing! but i have no way of knowing when ill be able to see the newest episode. there’s absolutely no information on any of the movies or shows. It’s annoying i cant take care of anything regarding my acct in the app, it opens Safari which is annoying. just a ton of little inconveniences makes it less than stellar and in my opinion, with all of the competitors, it should really be doing more. It needs a new UI, I want specific dates when things are coming, etc. All in all, its fine and definitely worth the money if you get your membership on a discount.","title":"Definitely have some issues to work out","userName":"sgilesxx"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7429168694","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-06-05T11:39:57Z","rating":5,"review":"Best series I have EVER watched.  The reality, creativity and emotional and physical chemistry between two actors and the supporting actors is unlike anything I’ve ever seen!  The thought to detail and the respectful way each incidence is brought forth.  The historical realness of what was going on in those years  and correctness is amazing, from the clothing to the tools and transportation of the times!   But the love story and the strength of two people that time cannot weaken and what they go through to be together…what it stirs within you cannot be matched!  I hope this series continues to go on for years to come!!  Diana Gabaldon is a genius and the production of her books to small screen is the best!  Let’s see it through to her book 10 and any side books she may have to go with it!  Everyone I talk to is watching Outlander and can’t get\n enough of it!  They are willing to go long periods until the creation of the next season!  To end it before book 10 is finished would be a travesty!

I enjoyed the show very much and the story line too. I will definitely go and watch the movie or prequel to see Miles and Collin’s story as well but I have to say Ashley’s story was very relatable to women and especially single mother’s everywhere. Trish’s character was an added bonus and a true joy, alongside her mom, Janell and Mama Nancy as well. Supporting characters make the show \u0026 although Earl was a little odd to be in the mix, it helped to have that older brother/ father figure there for Shawn. I was blinded in a good way and I enjoyed the interpretive dancing that brought out the feels within the story. I’m praying for a second season and continuation to the story. Maybe Miles can get let out early for good behavior? I hope so!

Dragging the bar at the bottom does not work to rewind/fast-forward, it just freezes the video then you have to hit pause then hit play for it to jump back to where you started from. I’ve had to use the 10-second jump feature to fast forward or rewind large parts of a video. And the best part is, when hitting the 10-second jump repeatedly, instead of rewinding/fast-forwarding 10-seconds, it only goes 6-seconds. \n\nI’m not paying for a streaming app where the basic features don’t work. The ability to rewind/fast-forward is something I’ve always taken for granted because no other streaming service has a problem with this, it’s such a basic functionality. I just paid for the first month after a free trial, but this is not worth it and I’ll be cancelling. There’s way too many other options with good content out there to pay for an app that has a lazy, outdated interface and lacks basic functionality.","title":"App is terrible ( not a content review)","userName":"ajay1760"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4391378733","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-06-30T12:43:21Z","rating":1,"review":"The description says that we can use the starz app but after signing up to the starz monthly app and tried to sign into the starz app I get a log in error.
