PianoStream is like Pandora for your player piano! It works incredibly well on PianoDisc iQ, Prodigy and QRS and on ALL Disklaviers!\n\nWe have multiple streaming stations for your piano! We cover BEAUTIFUL music that no one else would EVEN think of covering from the 60's, 70's 80,s and 90's. Also Modern hits, Classical, Jazz and every other genre. And our Christmas station is the best! \n\nWe also have a \"Requested Songs\" station where users around the world submit their requests and also a \"Recently Added\" station. \n\nPianoStream has two interfaces: PDisc for PianoDisc systems namely PDS128+, PDS228, CD Only, iQ and Prodigy. And Disklvr for all Disklaviers and for all pianos with MIDI in/out.\n\nThe Disklvr interface is compatible with the Wagon Grand all the way up to Enspire and everything in between! This includes DKC850 and DKC900 and E3. The Disklvr interface will also play on most QRS systems, PianoDisc Prodigy, PDS128+ and the PDS228 because all of them have midi ports. Most PianoDisc players will work with both PianoStream interfaces. The PDisc interface sends an analog signal to the piano and the Disklvr interface sends midi data to the piano. \n\nDisklvr interface uses wireless midi. The best wireless midi receiver out there is the Yamaha MD-BT01. Use the B06 bluetooth audio receiver on Amazon to send an analog signal to PianoDisc systems. \n\nPianoDisc Prodigy has a built in Analog Bluetooth receiver and Bluetooth MIDI receiver therefore it can work with both PianoStream interfaces. \n\nPLEASE join our Facebook PianoStream page where you can garner a better understanding of PianoStream. Long story short however, this app is INCREDIBLE! You will love your piano now more than EVER. Please email Richie at hayesiq@gmail.com with any technical questions or post them on our PianoStream Facebook page. \n\nWith PianoStream you can stream your own copyrighted music library. As in you can upload your legally acquired PianoDisc mp3's or Yamaha MIDI files and other third party content to your iCloud account. Then you can create playlists or \"Stations\" in PianoStream to stream your music which only you can see and access.\n\nFor $2.99 a week, $9.99 a month, or a flat fee of $99.99 a year, you'll have full access to all of our content which is constantly growing! All of our music is HIGH quality. Most of it is not quantized or produced by a computer. You'll feel like someone is actually there performing a concert just for you and your family. That's how good we sound! Currently we have about 40+ stations which include almost every genre of music. \n\n*Much of our material was produced in-house by some really incredible pianists.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Enjoy PianoStream the piano app that’s compatible with all player pianos and keyboards! Your Yamaha Enspire, PianoDisc Prodigy and or QRS are all in for a treat!<br /><br />*Please join our PianoStream Facebook page for continual updates regarding everything PianoStream! <br /><br />Welcome to PIANOSTREAM featuring MauColi The Pianoman and many other incredible artists from around the world. PianoStream is like Pandora for your player piano! It works incredibly well on PianoDisc iQ, Prodigy and QRS and on ALL Disklaviers!<br /><br />We have multiple streaming stations for your piano! We cover BEAUTIFUL music that no one else would EVEN think of covering from the 60&#39;s, 70&#39;s 80,s and 90&#39;s. Also Modern hits, Classical, Jazz and every other genre. And our Christmas station is the best! <br /><br />We also have a &quot;Requested Songs&quot; station where users around the world submit their requests and also a &quot;Recently Added&quot; station. <br /><br />PianoStream has two interfaces: PDisc for PianoDisc systems namely PDS128+, PDS228, CD Only, iQ and Prodigy. And Disklvr for all Disklaviers and for all pianos with MIDI in/out.<br /><br />The Disklvr interface is compatible with the Wagon Grand all the way up to Enspire and everything in between! This includes DKC850 and DKC900 and E3. The Disklvr interface will also play on most QRS systems, PianoDisc Prodigy, PDS128+ and the PDS228 because all of them have midi ports. Most PianoDisc players will work with both PianoStream interfaces. The PDisc interface sends an analog signal to the piano and the Disklvr interface sends midi data to the piano. <br /><br />Disklvr interface uses wireless midi. The best wireless midi receiver out there is the Yamaha MD-BT01. Use the B06 bluetooth audio receiver on Amazon to send an analog signal to PianoDisc systems. <br /><br />PianoDisc Prodigy has a built in Analog Bluetooth receiver and Bluetooth MIDI receiver therefore it can work with both PianoStream interfaces. <br /><br />PLEASE join our Facebook PianoStream page where you can garner a better understanding of PianoStream. Long story short however, this app is INCREDIBLE! You will love your piano now more than EVER. Please email Richie at hayesiq@gmail.com with any technical questions or post them on our PianoStream Facebook page. <br /><br />With PianoStream you can stream your own copyrighted music library.

    The best player piano streaming music app EVER

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>At first I did the monthly subscription but I was blown away within the first few minutes and knew I would go with the yearly subscription. This is so much better than having to pay for an “album” that may only have 2 or 3 songs that I like. The PianoStream app is pure 👂🍬for your piano (and you). The app works flawlessly every time. Customer support is excellent. There are hundreds of great songs in every genre and more are added frequently. These are popular songs, not your run of the mill.  The app is upgraded frequently with awesome improvements that seem to never end thanks to Richie Hayes’ tireless efforts. He is to be applauded for the creation of this wonderful app and all that goes with it. Thanks to all those behind the scenes too. MauColi’s piano playing is awesome<br />👂🍬!!! Try PianoStream, you won’t be disappointed!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Discovered this app last Friday and decided to subscribe to the service for a week. Thought I’d try it out over the weekend on my PD Prodigy equipped Schimmel.  Well, it’s Monday and I just cancelled my weekly subscription to sign up for the yearly plan. To put it simply, PIANOSTREAM is clearly the best app to fully enjoy your player piano. For those of us who use the PianoDisc app, I’m sure you’ve experienced the numerous glitches found in the program. No worries with the PIANOSTREAM. It works seamlessly with the Prodigy, is not impacted by the PD app nor does it affect the use of the PD app.  The music is high quality, comparable to the “Artist Series “ from the PD Music Store. Thank you B&amp;T Entertainment Inc!</p>

    Beautifully streams via Yamaha Disklavier
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app brings out the beautiful sound from my Yamaha Disklavier M4. I used to rely on Yamaha’s Pianosoft music, purchasing songs and albums which was time consuming and needlessly expensive. With Pianostream I can stream music from different stations and genres. I can also save and stream my own midi files. It is an excellent way to connect wirelessly to my piano. With my Pianostream BT/midi connection, I use other programs for online piano lessons. Pianostream continues to improve its BT connectivity and functionality while also providing excellent support through the Pianostream FB site. I enjoy my grand piano more than ever.</p>

Or let's suppose that you have a PianoDisc iQ and you have no interest in the MIDI Player, well you can lock the interface so that the player doesn't ever pop up. \n\nLet's say you're a dealer. You have a piano in a restaurant. You don't want any crazy stuff you just want simple background dinner music playing in the background. You can now easily LOCK PIANOSTREAM on the station that you'd like people to hear. They won't have access to anything else. And to top it off, you could gather the content that you'd like them to have, and then have us create a custom station for you.\n\nNow you can just use your iPhone to play your piano you don't need the internet! This is REALLY nice. Say you live out in the middle of nowhere but your phone works just fine. Well you can easily bluetooth MIDI Player content or even PianoDisc content. This is kind of confusing but you could now talk to your PianoDisc system 3 ways: AirPort Express. Yamaha Bluetooth MIDI Receiver.

PianoStream is like Pandora for your player piano! It works incredibly well on PianoDisc iQ, Prodigy and QRS and on ALL Disklaviers!\n\nWe have multiple streaming stations for your piano! We cover BEAUTIFUL music that no one else would EVEN think of covering from the 60's, 70's 80,s and 90's. Also Modern hits, Classical, Jazz and every other genre. And our Christmas station is the best! \n\nWe also have a \"Requested Songs\" station where users around the world submit their requests and also a \"Recently Added\" station. \n\nPianoStream has two interfaces: PDisc for PianoDisc systems namely PDS128+, PDS228, CD Only, iQ and Prodigy. And Disklvr for all Disklaviers and for all pianos with MIDI in/out.\n\nThe Disklvr interface is compatible with the Wagon Grand all the way up to Enspire and everything in between! This includes DKC850 and DKC900 and E3. The Disklvr interface will also play on most QRS systems, PianoDisc Prodigy, PDS128+ and the PDS228 because all of them have midi ports. Most PianoDisc players will work with both PianoStream interfaces. The PDisc interface sends an analog signal to the piano and the Disklvr interface sends midi data to the piano. \n\nDisklvr interface uses wireless midi. The best wireless midi receiver out there is the Yamaha MD-BT01. Use the B06 bluetooth audio receiver on Amazon to send an analog signal to PianoDisc systems. \n\nPianoDisc Prodigy has a built in Analog Bluetooth receiver and Bluetooth MIDI receiver therefore it can work with both PianoStream interfaces. \n\nPLEASE join our Facebook PianoStream page where you can garner a better understanding of PianoStream. Long story short however, this app is INCREDIBLE! You will love your piano now more than EVER.

All of our music is HIGH quality. Most of it is not quantized or produced by a computer. You'll feel like someone is actually there performing a concert just for you and your family. That's how good we sound! Currently we have about 40+ stations which include almost every genre of music. \n\n*Much of our material was produced in-house by some really incredible pianists.

Thought I’d try it out over the weekend on my PD Prodigy equipped Schimmel.  Well, it’s Monday and I just cancelled my weekly subscription to sign up for the yearly plan. To put it simply, PIANOSTREAM is clearly the best app to fully enjoy your player piano. For those of us who use the PianoDisc app, I’m sure you’ve experienced the numerous glitches found in the program. No worries with the PIANOSTREAM. It works seamlessly with the Prodigy, is not impacted by the PD app nor does it affect the use of the PD app.  The music is high quality, comparable to the “Artist Series “ from the PD Music Store.

It supports direct midi connections, but the interface really doesn’t mention anything other than network or bluetooth so you have to fiddle with the settings to get the direct USB midi to work. Also it does not support landscape mode. These are my two biggest gripes and it would have gotten 5 stars if it weren’t for this. Landscape mode is a must if you are using an iPad with a wired connections, as you won’t be able to stand the iPad on the music stand in portrait mode with a usb adapter hanging off the bottom. Please add this, as I also believe that Apple is making landscape iPad compatibility a requirement for future apps anyways.","title":"Alsmost perfect","userName":"japaneezy"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5609263505","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-03-03T06:16:02Z","rating":5,"review":"The library of music to stream to my PianoDisk 228 system is huge and varied.

This app just makes so much more sense than buying from the PianoDisc store where you have to pay over $35 to buy a whole album, even if you really only want one song.  The PIANOSTREAM facebook page is also very helpful, and the app developer will answer your questions and take any suggestions or recommendations you may have.  PIANOSTREAM has a great song library.

\n\nWelcome to PIANOSTREAM featuring MauColi The Pianoman and many other incredible artists from around the world. PianoStream is like Pandora for your player piano! It works incredibly well on PianoDisc iQ, Prodigy and QRS and on ALL Disklaviers!\n\nWe have multiple streaming stations for your piano! We cover BEAUTIFUL music that no one else would EVEN think of covering from the 60's, 70's 80,s and 90's. Also Modern hits, Classical, Jazz and every other genre. And our Christmas station is the best! \n\nWe also have a \"Requested Songs\" station where users around the world submit their requests and also a \"Recently Added\" station. \n\nPianoStream has two interfaces: PDisc for PianoDisc systems namely PDS128+, PDS228, CD Only, iQ and Prodigy. And Disklvr for all Disklaviers and for all pianos with MIDI in/out.\n\nThe Disklvr interface is compatible with the Wagon Grand all the way up to Enspire and everything in between! This includes DKC850 and DKC900 and E3. The Disklvr interface will also play on most QRS systems, PianoDisc Prodigy, PDS128+ and the PDS228 because all of them have midi ports. Most PianoDisc players will work with both PianoStream interfaces. The PDisc interface sends an analog signal to the piano and the Disklvr interface sends midi data to the piano. \n\nDisklvr interface uses wireless midi. The best wireless midi receiver out there is the Yamaha MD-BT01. Use the B06 bluetooth audio receiver on Amazon to send an analog signal to PianoDisc systems. \n\nPianoDisc Prodigy has a built in Analog Bluetooth receiver and Bluetooth MIDI receiver therefore it can work with both PianoStream interfaces. \n\nPLEASE join our Facebook PianoStream page where you can garner a better understanding of PianoStream. Long story short however, this app is INCREDIBLE! You will love your piano now more than EVER. Please email Richie at hayesiq@gmail.com with any technical questions or post them on our PianoStream Facebook page. \n\nWith PianoStream you can stream your own copyrighted music library. As in you can upload your legally acquired PianoDisc mp3's or Yamaha MIDI files and other third party content to your iCloud account. Then you can create playlists or \"Stations\" in PianoStream to stream your music which only you can see and access.\n\nFor $2.99 a week, $9.99 a month, or a flat fee of $99.99 a year, you'll have full access to all of our content which is constantly growing! All of our music is HIGH quality. Most of it is not quantized or produced by a computer. You'll feel like someone is actually there performing a concert just for you and your family. That's how good we sound! Currently we have about 40+ stations which include almost every genre of music. \n\n*Much of our material was produced in-house by some really incredible pianists. A lot of it was purchased. We also stream some public domain content. We are fully licensed with ASCAP so as to legally stream all kinds of beautiful music. We do not wish to violate any copyrights. If a concern is ever raised over a song we stream, we will resolve the concern or remove it immediately. \n\n\n- Subscription period is 1 week, 1 month or 1 year.

What does this mean!? Now you can play any Disklavier starting with Wagon grands all the way up to Enspire! Own a QRS system!? How about Spirio!? Wonderful! Now you'll have even more music! PIANOSTREAM'S MIDI player will play MIDI files from the internet and also ones that you or others create. You email yourself that which you'd like to play and request that PIANOSTREAM open it. You can easily transpose the song which you're playing on the fly. You can even listen to a song on your phone before you listen to it on a piano because of our \"Local Sound\" feature. We have also included Tempo control and a Song Position slide bar. Very Cool! How does this work? Well you will need a Bluetooth MIDI receiver built by Yamaha. It's $50 bucks but it's worth every penny. You'll plug that into the MIDI In/Out ports of your instrument. You must have both IN and OUT or PIANOSTREAM MIDI Player WILL NOT WORK. Here is the item you'll need on amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-Wireless-MD-BT01-5-PIN-Adapter/dp/B01CFOHF6U/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8\u0026qid=1519041547\u0026sr=8-3\u0026keywords=bluetooth+midi\n\nSo now that we have covered the new MIDI player portion of PIANOSTREAM let's quickly talk about the other really cool features which will have you enjoying your piano like never before! \n*Easily shuffle back and forth through songs.\n*Easily set High and Low volume limits.\n*Have us create custom stations for you or your customers which only you can access.\n*Master Volume Control always in MAIN\n*See all the contents of a station\n*Easily sort stations by choosing from the following: Show All Songs. Show Piano Only. Show Piano + Audio Only. Show Audio Only. Show Favorite Stations Only. Show Favorite Songs Only\n*Easily save favorite songs for easy playback.\n*Easily save favorite stations.\n*Send music to your piano directly from you iPhone. No WIFI necessary.\n\nLet's suppose you have a Disklavier. If so, you won't want the regular PIANOSTREAM spinning record interface, you'd want the MIDI Player interface. You can lock that interface in place. Now when you start up the app, MIDI Player is ready to go. Or let's suppose that you have a PianoDisc iQ and you have no interest in the MIDI Player, well you can lock the interface so that the player doesn't ever pop up. \n\nLet's say you're a dealer. You have a piano in a restaurant. You don't want any crazy stuff you just want simple background dinner music playing in the background. You can now easily LOCK PIANOSTREAM on the station that you'd like people to hear. They won't have access to anything else. And to top it off, you could gather the content that you'd like them to have, and then have us create a custom station for you.\n\nNow you can just use your iPhone to play your piano you don't need the internet! This is REALLY nice. Say you live out in the middle of nowhere but your phone works just fine. Well you can easily bluetooth MIDI Player content or even PianoDisc content. This is kind of confusing but you could now talk to your PianoDisc system 3 ways: AirPort Express. Yamaha Bluetooth MIDI Receiver.
