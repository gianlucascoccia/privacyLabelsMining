        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>My daughter is obsessed with these videos and I absolutely do not mind paying a subscription fee for how many videos we get. I love that you added a feature to access on multiple devices that makes things so much better because when we are on the go and she gets cranky she cheers up watching them. But ever since this feature was added and there is the new look it is very hard to navigate and I run into a lot of issues. I really like the old look and How the videos were set up. I think that should be brought back.. now it looks like we’re just on a webpage and things about the subscription are hard to get away from even though we’re subscribed. It definitely has bugs that need to be worked through but as for the videos, my daughter could watch them for hours on end if I let her and they are awesome! Worth the subscription fee, there are no ads in the free videos or any videos and that is definitely what I love about it. Also the help center is very helpful &amp; gets back to you very quickly!</p>

    Constantly locks up and freezes my phone

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app and the app peak a boo all from the same developer, completely lock my phone up almost as soon as I go to open the app. I downloaded it for my 18 month old to play with and opened it and the app locked up on the opening screen and then locked my entire phone up along with it. None of my buttons to include the home button would work. I had to do a hard reset on the phone just to get it unfrozen. It’s not my memory because after looking into that, I found that I still have almost 75 gigs of space left on my storage. So I checked other apps. I then opened every app I had available on my phone that was on my screen and none of them did locked up. I even left them all running in the background to see if I could replicate the issue while I continued opening apps. Then I get to these last apps which are by this developer and boom. It completely locked my phone up again. Then I hard reset my phone again and closed everything out and checked my WiFi connection by running a speed test from my phone. It showed that I was getting 100mbps at the current moment. So I then open this developer’s app and only this app and it froze my phone up for a 3rd time with nothing else open or running in the background.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love this app so much because my child loves interacting with the videos. He will laugh and jump up and down. This also works so well when he has an attitude, it really calms him. Cute, funny and appropriate cartoons make a parent smile. <br />My only problem with this app is that you have to pay or watch an add to see a video. This upsets me because I don’t want to pay to have my child watch some funny or cute video. Most of these videos should be free, because we all have different life styles. I think my child should also have the freedom to explore and learn on the app. <br />This app has brought my family joy, just needs some improvement. <br />Sincerely, Alexa Gatewood</p>

In addition to the above, we collect general non-Personal Information, such as information on your country or city in order to conduct analytics in order to improve our Site and adapt it to our users.\n \n\n3.      Use and Disclosure of Information\n\nA.    We may use the information we collect, including Personal Information, to provide you with, improve and personalize services, features and content, to manage your account, to contact you, to conduct research and review of our site, services and features, and to offer you related goods, services and content.\n\nB.     We may use your information, and allow business partners or affiliates of ours to use it in a manner that is not personally identifiable in order to conduct research about use of this site, user habits and preferences.\n\nC.     We may use information, including Personal Information, to send you news and updates regarding this site and to offer you advertisements and promotions of goods and services on behalf of ourselves, or business partners or affiliates.

In certain circumstances, we may provide Personal Information or non-personal information, or both to third parties that provide us with technical services, support or other services regarding the maintenance and operation of this site and its related services. When we do that, we will require the third party not to use the information for any other purpose and not to transfer it to a third party.\n\nE.     Additionally, we may provide Personal Information or non-personal information, or both to a third party, as required by an order or subpoena issued by a judicial or administrative authority or by a law enforcement agency, or as we may in good faith, consider necessary under law, or upon a request or demand received by us in connection with a legal complaint, claim, suit or procedure.\n\nF.      We may share or transfer information, including Personal Information to our subsidiaries, parent or other related corporations, or to another corporation in the event of a merger, acquisition of this site or of BFTV, or a business reorganization or restructure. In such event, all information may become subject to a different Privacy Policy as used or adopted by the acquiring party.\n \n\n4.      Children's Privacy\n\nA.    BFTV has made every effort to comply with the rules of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 1998 (COPPA) and provide a safe and secure environment for babies and toddlers and their parents to use and enjoy this Site..\n\nB.     Because BFTV is intended for use by babies and toddlers under the supervision of their parents, and is not directed towards children of reading age, we ask and expect that only Parents provide Personal Information, including any Personal Information about their babies and toddlers, such as pictures, videos and first names.\n\nC.     We do not collect Personal Information from Children themselves and do not allow children to open accounts, or participate in competitions or sweepstakes. Only Parents may open accounts or enter competitions or sweepstakes. If you are a Child, you may not submit any Personal Information or try to open an account or participate in a competition or sweepstake.\n\nD.    If we become aware that despite our safeguards a Child has submitted Personal Information, we will contact the Child's parent as soon as possible at the email address provided and ask him or her to verify that he or she consents to the submission. If the parent does not respond within two days, or if the Child has not provided a working and correct email for the Parent we will delete any Personal Information submitted.\n\nE.    Parents may at any time contact us to receive information about our Children's privacy policy, or to enquire about any Personal Information that they believe may have been collected from their Child. This can be done by contacting us at:Website Manager, BFTV, 10390 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 310 Royal Beverly Glen Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90025, USA, or by email to info@BFTV.com, or by telephone at 885-251-BABY.\n\nF.    When you contact us to ask for specific information about your Child’s information, we will first verify that you are the Child’s parent. We may do this in one of the following manners: asking you to send us a signed verification form by post or fax, asking for photographic or documentary proof of identity, through a trained operator who will speak to you in person when you call the above dedicated telephone number, or by asking you to submit a valid credit card number.\n\nG.    Any Personal Information collected from a Child will be used and shared only as set out in Section 3.\n\nH.    You may also access you Child’s Personal Information and amend or delete it by using the function at my account and entering the user name and password.\n\nI.

None of my buttons to include the home button would work. I had to do a hard reset on the phone just to get it unfrozen. It’s not my memory because after looking into that, I found that I still have almost 75 gigs of space left on my storage. So I checked other apps. I then opened every app I had available on my phone that was on my screen and none of them did locked up. I even left them all running in the background to see if I could replicate the issue while I continued opening apps. Then I get to these last apps which are by this developer and boom. It completely locked my phone up again. Then I hard reset my phone again and closed everything out and checked my WiFi connection by running a speed test from my phone. It showed that I was getting 100mbps at the current moment.

I should have read the reviews first. Every few days I have to restore purchases. It doesn’t charge again but it’s in convenient to do every few days. The videos are only about 3 or 4 minutes long. If there is a way to autoplay the videos I haven’t figured it out yet. I initially got this app for a road trip, so imagine my surprise when every few minutes I had to tap another video to play. To download the videos it seems as if you actually have to go In And watch the entire video, THEN it will be in the downloads. I only have about 7 videos because it takes so long to do when you’re already a busy parent. The advertising states that you can use on multiple devices. When trying to add it to Dads phone there was no way to bypass having to re purchase and we are not paying twice for this crap of an ap.

Instead you need to spend more for the “premium” subscription which is $5.99 a month.  \nClearly Babyfirst is not about anything other than making money. If you truly cared about kids you would offer one reasonable subscription price. I refuse to pay almost $6 a month for the limited amount of activities when that is the only thing my child uses it for. \nYou also should make it much clearer as to what you will receive with each subscription. \nBabyfirst started off decent my first child used to watch the channel on cable and we paid an extra fee to get the channel. There were no ads on it either.

There’s also a section with fun educational games and with the price of $3 a month you really can’t beat that ! We paid for the full year and you can download videos so if you have a tablet or iPad , they can watch videos on the go even when there’s no WiFi available. I’d definitely give it a try !
