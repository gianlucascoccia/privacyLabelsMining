        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This planetarium in your pocket makes it easy to discover the wonders of space wherever you go. Day or night, just aim your device skyward to see a live 3D map of the heavens, complete with beautifully illustrated constellations, stars, planets, and satellites. A special night mode helps you read the map in the dark, while integrated weather reports show the best times for stargazing. You can even have notifications alert you to future astronomical events.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I would have never known the International Space Station orbits the Earth about 15 times per day. I now watch it orbit twice just about every night.  On non-cloudy nights anyway.  It’s amazing. It’s like a star shooting across the night sky and Night Sky alerts us a couple minutes in advance then shows us exactly where to look. My 6 yr. old daughter has changed from wanting to be a veterinarian to wanting to be a space station driver.  ;-)<br />Not sure if the main intention of this app is educational or to get kids dreaming of space travel but it does both very well. Only had it for a few days now so it will be fun to see what else it does.  I imagine we have only scratched the surface. Definitely spend the $10 on the year membership. Jumping from planet to planet and seeing the sky and stars from their perspective is worth $100.  We saw a planetarium show this week at the Tulsa Air and Space Museum.  This app is like your own show. There is a ton of activity going on in the night sky. It’s so much more interesting and fun to see when you know what you’re looking at.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love this app but lately it’s not picking up everything. There is a bright object to the top left of the moon right now, in close relation visually, and it’s not registering on the app. I gave it the benefit of the doubt that the bodies showing up a little further out were it but none of them lined up with position in the sky in relation and visual proximity to the moon. The app used to be spot on. Second time in 2 months I’ve been disappointed with as many times using it. Last time it wouldn’t show me where the moon was at all when I was trying to brag about the app to friends.<br /><br />Next night:<br />It was Mars. Why wouldn’t it be superimposed over one another and have something that says what it is? And when you try to zoom in to a local body you get visually flooded with our local cluster of galaxies (honestly, that’s annoying. I know it’s a combination of our galaxy with other galaxies mingled in, but help me learn from local bodies! At least give a staged zoom prompt where you can zoom to the inner planets, then the outer planets, then the galaxy, followed by the super clusters if you wanna take it deep lol. Also, this used to have a super easy to use function where you type in a local body and arrows guide you to its location in the sky. Why would you get rid of that?! 🤷‍♂️</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Thank you for your review.  You are able to completely customize how Night Sky presents the sky from Preferences within the main menu of Night Sky so we would encourage exploring the app some more.  Our app does accurately display the positions of stars and planets so it&#39;s not clear why you have been experiencing issues. If we can be of any further assistance, please reach out to the team at Support@NightSky.com, who will be happy to help.  We hope to earn your 5 star review!</p>

I now watch it orbit twice just about every night.  On non-cloudy nights anyway.  It’s amazing. It’s like a star shooting across the night sky and Night Sky alerts us a couple minutes in advance then shows us exactly where to look. My 6 yr. old daughter has changed from wanting to be a veterinarian to wanting to be a space station driver.  ;-)\nNot sure if the main intention of this app is educational or to get kids dreaming of space travel but it does both very well. Only had it for a few days now so it will be fun to see what else it does.  I imagine we have only scratched the surface. Definitely spend the $10 on the year membership. Jumping from planet to planet and seeing the sky and stars from their perspective is worth $100.  We saw a planetarium show this week at the Tulsa Air and Space Museum.  This app is like your own show. There is a ton of activity going on in the night sky. It’s so much more interesting and fun to see when you know what you’re looking at.","title":"If you don’t have this app you’re missing out.","userName":"Mike Wyckoff"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6403146546","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-07T02:32:23Z","developerResponse":{"id":17754808,"body":"Thank you for your review.

There is a bright object to the top left of the moon right now, in close relation visually, and it’s not registering on the app. I gave it the benefit of the doubt that the bodies showing up a little further out were it but none of them lined up with position in the sky in relation and visual proximity to the moon. The app used to be spot on. Second time in 2 months I’ve been disappointed with as many times using it. Last time it wouldn’t show me where the moon was at all when I was trying to brag about the app to friends.\n\nNext night:\nIt was Mars. Why wouldn’t it be superimposed over one another and have something that says what it is? And when you try to zoom in to a local body you get visually flooded with our local cluster of galaxies (honestly, that’s annoying. I know it’s a combination of our galaxy with other galaxies mingled in, but help me learn from local bodies! At least give a staged zoom prompt where you can zoom to the inner planets, then the outer planets, then the galaxy, followed by the super clusters if you wanna take it deep lol. Also, this used to have a super easy to use function where you type in a local body and arrows guide you to its location in the sky.

I found it by going through Trial and Errors of trying to find the best app to look at the sky. I’ve sat i went though 5-6 apps before I was happy with my choice. It’s offers you so many features without even paying for it, as you would have to do for any other app. It’s crazy. Because it’s a free app that offers you AR experiences to blend with your night sky, real time constellations, stars, galaxies, Nebulas, satellites, and even major NASA things like, Hubble Telescope, International Space Station, Meteor Showers And so much more. It has tours of planets too. They also have media news updates everyday about anything going on in space like, The Mercury and Mars Conjunction and Major things that will be able to be seen with the Naked Eye.\nI’ve dragged this on for too long but, over all it’s the best app to use for everyone who likes Astronomy and for Astronomers.\n\n-Iyana","title":"Honestly, worth it","userName":"Gkgmoskfjfjdjfjfndhdhhdhfj"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4153031444","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-05-15T09:49:31Z","developerResponse":{"id":12549042,"body":"Updated response December 23 2019:  Thank you for your review.

In order to make sure your device is calibrated correctly, please make sure you are not using a third party case on your device. This can sometimes interfere with the compass causing an inaccurate reading. Also please make sure you have allowed Night Sky access to your location, you can confirm this by running the Tutorial from the main menu. Also you can manually align the sky using the compass alignment tool, just tap the triangular shape in the top left hand side of the screen to do this then swipe the sky to tweak alignment.

If you just want an app to show you what is in the sky that is a good app. Night sky is too complicated.\n\nI think I like this app but it is a little confusing to use. First it doesn't seem to reflect the actual sky. For instance, when I point it at Ursa Major it doesn’t show it exactly where it is in the sky. So, I am never sure what I am looking at when I look at the actual sky. It is like it just shows a map of the sky and isn’t really showing me the actual sky. I tried to use the sky blending but I can’t figure out how it works. The tutorial is lacking.  I would like to see more explanation of each feature in the help section. Also in the preferences, there is no explanation of what each option is. For example, what does it mean if I enable the “moon” preference? I saw in one of the reviews the developers said to use the compass align to fix the view of the sky. I tried that but how does it work? What does the + or - degrees mean? More explanation is needed. I want to just point it at the sky and see exactly what I am pointing at be reflected in the view. I have had this app for years but just picked it up again. The older version was much simpler and more accurate.","title":"Nice app but a little confusing to use","userName":"TKC1919"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6228104916","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-22T13:12:45Z","developerResponse":{"id":16828268,"body":"Thank you for your review!

We hope this has helped, however if we can be of anymore assistance, please reach out to the team at Support@NightSky.com.  We'd love to earn your 5 star review!

The app didn’t respond as I moved my iPad—I could spin the display in any direction so North could be South, e.g.—so essentially it was no help at all with locating anything. Given that the user is likely to enter areas with no WiFi, there should be some way of addressing this scenario.\nWhich leads me to my other complaint. The tutorial is so bare boned it’s difficult to figure out how to use some features. I don’t mind exploring on my own; in fact it’s rather fun. But sometimes I’d discover how to do something and later couldn’t remember how I did it, and there’s no guide to help, so I’d have to figure it out all over again. There were a couple of features I couldn’t get at all, like the Siri voice command to find an object.\nSo, overall, while the app offers great feature, it doesn’t provide a very good means of helping you use them. Disappointing.","title":"Froze up in the field; little in the way of instructions","userName":".kj uihbb"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7169040769","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-04-01T02:45:46Z","developerResponse":{"id":22018934,"body":"Thank you for your review, we're sorry you experienced some issues.\nCan you please try restarting your device and try relaunching this app. If you require anymore assistance, please reach out to the team at Support@Nightsky.com who will be happy to help.

No complaints. I haven’t used it in a while and just did the update. There’s a My Views  feature that I’m trying to use for an upcoming trip. The app crashes/shuts down every time I choose a date and time and press save. It doesn’t matter if it’s my location or a far flung one. Tonight or a month from now. Just crashes. It’s annoying. \n\nAlso the Night Sky Views and Stargazing Event tabs don’t work. Says something about internet connection. My internet is working perfectly fine everywhere else (even the rest of the apps features). All in all I like the app. The latest upgrade does have some bugs/glitches. Or maybe it’s me. Could be. Don’t think so though. \n\nJust a note, I’ve used the free version until tonight. I just upgraded to the free trial.

I had gone through trial and error, but this app was overall the best. Okay, now to the things that can improve: 1. When you click on the place that shows what the weather condition is, the temperature, and when the sun and moon will go up or down, the app automatically sets the time to when the sun goes down. I would love if the app automatically set to the current time. 2. When I search for a faint object (Proxima Centauri for example), the app shows me the location, but no pointers or anything tell me where the object is. It is impossible to find some objects 😢. 3. Please show moons of other planets in our solar system, or some planets from different stars. I would love to see solar systems of other stars. Finally, please do not send me the link to your help website, just read the review and try to improve. In no way do I think this is a bad app, quite frankly...I love it!

Improvements came quickly, though more fine tuning is needed. I’m still very impressed by their passion to put out a quality product and customer service!\n\nOriginal review: Received an alert on my watch that the ISS would be flying over and offered to take me to it. I thought, why not... hazy, but might get lucky. So, the display on the watch showed a pretty high path (as opposed to those low on the horizon). So, keep checking my watch face arrow pointing up/down to pinpoint location. I grab my phone and open the app, met with a sales pitch 8 pages long! (Longer than most ISS passes). Find the end, close it and look for the ISS icon to appear where the arrows on the watch are pointing. Nothing. Turn to go back inside, and there it is much further north gliding across the sky NOT where the arrows/flight path were pointing! I didn’t even bother to check the app on the phone as it couldn’t even sync with it’s counterpart on the watch. Super frustrating!","title":"Good to bad... to not so bad.","userName":"gsmith119"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4392293970","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-06-30T16:07:22Z","developerResponse":{"id":12549104,"body":"Updated Response December 23rd 2019:  We're just revisiting some of the reviews since our major update this year as we feel it addresses your concerns.

Night Sky offers several ways for users to access so it is accessible to all. You can use Night Sky for free and have access to an array of features.

Night Sky for Life gives you access to all of our upgrades to Night Sky without the need for a subscription.

My one and only complaint is that the app asks me every time I start it up if I want to upgrade. No. I do not want to f’ing pay for the upgrade. *edit* What kind of response is that from the developer? I am well aware the paid services offered. My issue is that the app offers these paid services too often. I would love to turn the app on without having to decline the paid services. When I’m outside using it, I usually have my telescope with me. I’ll find what I want to look at with the app, then put my phone on my pocket. When I want to move on to a different object, I open phone, and am asked if I want to pay for an upgrade. Every single time. I understand you have to advertise the paid services but it is a bit much.
