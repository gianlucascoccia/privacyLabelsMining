        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>My Podcasts are my media ecosystem.  I subscribed to real vision because that had an excellent podcast and I wanted more content similar to the podcast.  The issue I ran into is that I consume my content on the go and this platform is designed for people to sit down and watch it.  I don’t have time for that and the podcast has become irrelevant.  I saw the app on my phone and realized I was no longer engaged with the platform at all.  It’s unfortunate that I can only cancel my subscription in April 2020 and I can’t end it sooner.  Overall content is good but it isn’t delivered in a manner that works for me to consume.</p>

    Fixed Bugs after Subscription Update

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Update:  Good to go now!  Problems with subscription update were corrected.  <br /><br />Assessment: The content on this platform is fantastic!  No joke, it’s content that is great for those who want to get REAL insight and learn about investments, financial markets, economy and/or ideas on what to do with your retirement money. <br /><br />	A MACRO VIEW OF HOW THE FINANCIAL WORLD IS UNFOLDING SINCE THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISES.<br /><br /> 	IT’S YOUR MONEY AND IT’S ULTIMATELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INVEST AND SAFEGUARD YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.  You could leave it to the “professionals” and hope for the best.  Hope is not a strategy in my opinion.  Make the effort to FIGURE OUT HOW TO POSITION YOUR INVESTMENTS.  <br /><br />	This content is about in-depth conversations that are NOT a sound bite and very unlike TV/Cable shows that are totally clueless on how to inform  people about investing and finance.  IF YOU’RE INTEREST IN LEARNING AND RESEARCHING HOW THINGS WORK IN THE INVESTING WORLD, THEN IT’S OVER THE TOP WORTH THE MONEY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE TIME.</p>

If you do not want your Personal Information shared in this way, please do not connect your social media service account with your Real Vision Services account, and do not participate in social sharing on the Real Vision Services.\n\n(e) to protect the rights of Real Vision and others: There may be instances when Real Vision may disclose your Personal Information, including situations where we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of Real Vision, our Real Vision Affiliates or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our terms of use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of our products and services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process, including laws outside your country of residence; or (v) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence, and\n\n(f) to complete a merger, sale of assets, or bankruptcy: If Real Vision sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger, bankruptcy, or transfer of all or a material part of its business, Real Vision may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.\n\n \n\n5. Security\n\nReal Vision uses a combination of administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard Personal Information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting our customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services.\n\n \n\n6. Choices and Access\n\n6.1 Your Choices Regarding Our Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Information:\n\nWe give you certain choices regarding our use and disclosure of your Personal Information for marketing purposes.\n\nYou may opt-out from receiving electronic communications from us (including surveys or notifications) by changing your account settings through the appropriate link on the website account services page or following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.\n\nPlease note that there are certain service notifications that you may not opt-out of, such as renewal notices and notifications of changes to Real Vision products and services or policies. If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can change the settings either on your mobile device or through the app.\n\n6.2 How to Access, Correct or Update Your Personal Information: You can access, review, correct, update, delete or modify your registration or subscription profile information and modify your marketing preferences by contacting our customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services. Most subscribers can also update their Personal Information online by signing on to their accounts and visiting the appropriate account management sections of our websites.\n\nYou may also contact Real Vision’s customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services. For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\nPlease note that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion).\n\n6.3 Your California Privacy Rights: California Law permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact our customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services, and provide your name and the address to which you would like us to respond.\n\n \n\n7. Other Important Information\n\n7.1 Updates to Privacy Policy: Real Vision may modify this Privacy Policy. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Real Vision Services. Your use of the Real Vision Services or your provision of Personal Information to us following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.\n\n7.2 Location of Data: Your Personal Information may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using our products and services, you consent to the processing and transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules than in your country.\n\n7.3 Data Retention: We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.\n\n7.4 Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service: In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (“Payment Service”). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment in such a case, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.\n\n7.5 Linked Services: The Real Vision Services may also be linked to sites operated by third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, special offers, functionality, games or applications developed and maintained by third parties. Some of these third-party sites may be co-branded with a Real Vision logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. Real Vision is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave the Real Vision Services or click an advertisement, or sign up for a special offer, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service.\n\n \n\n8. Contact Us\n\nIf you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact our customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services. We ask that you not disclose any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, sexual orientation, gender status, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) when contacting us, as we do not require such information from you.\n\n©Copyright 2018 Real Vision Group SEZC.
