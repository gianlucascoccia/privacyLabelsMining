        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Just as the days are getting shorter and darker, we thought it would be fitting to release a long-requested feature for our iOS community: a universal dark mode setting! We know a lot of you like to keep your phone in light mode but use certain apps in dark mode all the time, so this feature satisfies that exact need. In this latest update, you can now set your Flipd theme to either light mode or dark mode, or use your phone&#39;s system settings — whatever your preference, Flipd can match it!<br /><br />There were also a few behind-the-scenes updates we made to this version to improve your experience, so please hit &#39;update&#39; or &#39;install&#39; and check those out!! <br /><br />What else is new... in case you missed it, we recently launched a brand new pomodoro timer! You can now set up a custom interval timer that lets you measure multiple rounds of focus + breaks. The pomodoro timer is just one more way Flipd is here to help you track and improve your productivity over time.<br /><br />And by the way for you Flipd newbies!! Here are a few things you should know to get started: create shortcuts tied to specific time goals, listen to free lofi music &amp; background noise while you work, try multi-task mode if you need to use other apps in the background, and join community groups to feel motivated with others! We promise Flipd will make you more productive, focused, and achieve your goals. <br /><br />As always, we&#39;re so very thankful for the support &amp; kind words we receive from our community everyday. We also appreciate all of our beta testers and study participants that help us test and improve the app! We hope you enjoy this update, and please let us know what you think by tagging @flipdapp.co on Instagram! <br /><br />Special note for those who&#39;ve read this far: if you&#39;d like to have some fun on the Flipd Discord server (Doers Club) you can join it for free by opening Flipd &gt; Settings &gt; Discord (at the bottom).</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The first time I ran this app, I was anxious for the whole time it was activated. It made it Impossible for me to use my phone for near everything. Every downloaded app was hidden, and even some of the  factory apps including my app store and safari as well. What i like about it is that you can&#39;t delete the Flipd app while it&#39;s running literally because it&#39;s not there to be deleted. <br /><br />The only things I have issues with are the fact that the process to keep the order of your apps is not as straightforward as It could be. Without the instructions from an online article I would have kept trying to install the extension without success. It gives the appearance of not having yet downloaded even though it&#39;s ready to go and that&#39;s confusing. Also, it would be nice if I could select exactly which apps i wanted to hide rather than just nearly disabling my phone. <br /><br />Other than that I would give the app 5 stars, it&#39;s really great.</p>

    Too Many Locked Features
</h3>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>When I first started using Flipd, I found it incredibly useful. However, I watched over  time as they slowly hid more of their features under the premium subscription. At first, I was able to tolerate the changes. For example, the change from unlimited breaks with every Flipd session to only one break allowed without a premium subscription wasn’t too bad for me. I decided that it would be best to take less breaks anyway. However, today it was the last straw. I discovered that all sessions longer than 40 minutes have been locked under the premium subscription. While I used to be able to go a few hours to a whole day at a time, now I can’t even spend an hour in a Flipd session. The only way for me to extend the session would be to constantly start a new one every 40 minutes. This is very inefficient, especially since I use Flipd to help me stay focused on homework for long periods of time. I am finding it increasingly less useful than it was before without upgrading to premium. I am in high school and currently unable to get a premium subscription. <br /><br />All I ask is for the sessions longer than 40 minutes to be made available for everyone again, or at least the 1 hour and 4 hour sessions. Flipd has been so helpful for me in the past, and I’d hate to lose so much from such a great tool. If you can make these longer sessions available without premium, it would be immensely appreciated. Thanks so much!</p>

    Probably as good as full lock can get given iOS limitations

      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>(I was looking for an app that could achieve a true lock down of non-essential apps. I only tried the 5 minute lock down on this app once, and haven’t used the app since.) As many others have said, full lock is an excellent idea but not great in execution. Others complained about the apps being out of order - that was fine for me. What I can’t live with is having my notification settings reset every time I get back from lock mode. I assume this is how the app works: they achieve lock mode by uninstalling and reinstalling all of your applications. The profile you install gives their servers access to control your phone remotely - which is why an internet connection is necessary. However, it seems that the scope of what they can control is limited - most likely due to iOS’s own limitations. The additional script you download seems to be a workaround to reorganize your apps as you had before, but it doesn’t restore your notification preferences on the apps that were un/reinstalled. Your apps give you the “allow notifications” pop-up next time you go into each of them. If you are OK with default notification settings, maybe this is a limitation you can live with. I customize the notifications for each app and I am not willing to readjust those every time I use lock down.</p>

To provide more context to other readers, the full lock feature is no longer offered in Flipd as of January 2020, but that feature can be found in our other app, Focus Lock. Please be sure you&#39;re downloading Focus Lock if you&#39;re looking for the feature to hide your apps, as it&#39;s not offered in Flipd. Thanks! - Alanna</p>

as the days are getting shorter and darker, we thought it would be fitting to release a long-requested feature for our iOS community: a universal dark mode setting! We know a lot of you like to keep your phone in light mode but use certain apps in dark mode all the time, so this feature satisfies that exact need. In this latest update, you can now set your Flipd theme to either light mode or dark mode, or use your phone's system settings — whatever your preference, Flipd can match it!\n\nThere were also a few behind-the-scenes updates we made to this version to improve your experience, so please hit 'update' or 'install' and check those out!! \n\nWhat else is new... in case you missed it, we recently launched a brand new pomodoro timer! You can now set up a custom interval timer that lets you measure multiple rounds of focus + breaks. The pomodoro timer is just one more way Flipd is here to help you track and improve your productivity over time.\n\nAnd by the way for you Flipd newbies!! Here are a few things you should know to get started: create shortcuts tied to specific time goals, listen to free lofi music \u0026 background noise while you work, try multi-task mode if you need to use other apps in the background, and join community groups to feel motivated with others! We promise Flipd will make you more productive, focused, and achieve your goals. \n\nAs always, we're so very thankful for the support \u0026 kind words we receive from our community everyday.

It made it Impossible for me to use my phone for near everything. Every downloaded app was hidden, and even some of the  factory apps including my app store and safari as well. What i like about it is that you can't delete the Flipd app while it's running literally because it's not there to be deleted. \n\nThe only things I have issues with are the fact that the process to keep the order of your apps is not as straightforward as It could be. Without the instructions from an online article I would have kept trying to install the extension without success. It gives the appearance of not having yet downloaded even though it's ready to go and that's confusing. Also, it would be nice if I could select exactly which apps i wanted to hide rather than just nearly disabling my phone. \n\nOther than that I would give the app 5 stars, it's really great.","title":"I use it almost every day","userName":"Dietlind N"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5739005339","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-03-31T04:42:56Z","developerResponse":{"id":14367950,"body":"Hey lambayear thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

However, I watched over  time as they slowly hid more of their features under the premium subscription. At first, I was able to tolerate the changes. For example, the change from unlimited breaks with every Flipd session to only one break allowed without a premium subscription wasn’t too bad for me. I decided that it would be best to take less breaks anyway. However, today it was the last straw. I discovered that all sessions longer than 40 minutes have been locked under the premium subscription. While I used to be able to go a few hours to a whole day at a time, now I can’t even spend an hour in a Flipd session. The only way for me to extend the session would be to constantly start a new one every 40 minutes. This is very inefficient, especially since I use Flipd to help me stay focused on homework for long periods of time. I am finding it increasingly less useful than it was before without upgrading to premium. I am in high school and currently unable to get a premium subscription. \n\nAll I ask is for the sessions longer than 40 minutes to be made available for everyone again, or at least the 1 hour and 4 hour sessions. Flipd has been so helpful for me in the past, and I’d hate to lose so much from such a great tool. If you can make these longer sessions available without premium, it would be immensely appreciated.

I only tried the 5 minute lock down on this app once, and haven’t used the app since.) As many others have said, full lock is an excellent idea but not great in execution. Others complained about the apps being out of order - that was fine for me. What I can’t live with is having my notification settings reset every time I get back from lock mode. I assume this is how the app works: they achieve lock mode by uninstalling and reinstalling all of your applications. The profile you install gives their servers access to control your phone remotely - which is why an internet connection is necessary. However, it seems that the scope of what they can control is limited - most likely due to iOS’s own limitations. The additional script you download seems to be a workaround to reorganize your apps as you had before, but it doesn’t restore your notification preferences on the apps that were un/reinstalled. Your apps give you the “allow notifications” pop-up next time you go into each of them. If you are OK with default notification settings, maybe this is a limitation you can live with. I customize the notifications for each app and I am not willing to readjust those every time I use lock down.","title":"Probably as good as full lock can get given iOS limitations","userName":"Ashlee Y"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3488963824","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-12-03T13:30:58Z","developerResponse":{"id":24074151,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to leave this review!

I was able to use text, email and phone but nothing else, well camera and standard apps I basically rarely use.  I was surprised to find there was no way to disable this at least that I know of.  Ok so here is why I gave it only a 3.  I have the majority of my icons in a separate folder because I DONT like my screen cluttered with icons!  So when my phone went OFF full lockdown ALL OF MY ICONS WERE ALL OVER MY SCREEN!!!!!  If you are going to block them PLEASE PIT THEM BACK!   Ok so it’s a free app does that give me the right to complain????  I would never pay $7.99 a month though or is it $5.99?  I forgot but either one is way too much!  Ok so last thing is that you can set an alarm, an alarm that is basically worthless because it is such a faint little “ting” that if you don’t have your phone right next to you it is worthless.....  plus I haven’t seen a repeat feature for the alarm so when you miss that tinny ting you can set it to ting again and again till you turn it off.  Other then those complaints I really liked it and will use it again.  I set the 4 hour mode lockdown and when I need google I wasn’t able to access it but that’s good in one sense I guess...

Then I tested it. Guess what. It didn’t work. I followed every step and had PERFECT internet connection. Turns out I wasn’t supposed to restart my phone, so okay..... but otherwise best screen time app I’ve found. (Okay ignore that part) I have a few suggestions though: \nA medium lock. You have light lock and a full lockdown mode, so it would be nice have a medium lock. It would be, you choose apps to restrict for a certain amount of time, almost like the lockdown mode, or it’s like the lockdown mode, but you choose apps to keep. \nMore apps to keep on lockdown mode. Not just any apps, but it would be nice to be able to keep some self help apps! That’s my main problem. \nTime tracker. I couldn’t think of a name for it, but it’s like you have say a hour to use a app every day before it disappears until the next day. \nSorry for this being so long, but those are some suggestions I think would be cool.

It like you download it self and I couldn’t get my apps back, I was so scared and I spent my studying time figuring out how to disable it without the app. If this out go to settings and remove its access profile. Trust me this got my apps back. Don’t try shutting/powering it off that doesn’t help (I tried that twice.) I will try this app again and if it works I will raise my review to a 5 if it works and the company responds to me. If the company doesn’t respond my review stays a 1. \n\n*edit* I tried this again and the app didn’t show up it disappeared when I did the full lock down the app Flipid disappeared and I couldn’t get out of full lock down so one again I had to go to settings and remove the management. I don’t have time to do this every time I go in lock down. Also I think the price is too much it should be the price of 1 month forever and I think that doing the custom times should be free.

First few times even a half hour full block will drive you crazy but later you start to live like a 90s person who only used their phone for calls and texts -and whichever email you have associated to the default app on your phone. Other email apps won’t work- (which I’ve found is the only really useful things I do with my phone) so I have lost much less time since I installed flipd and I have learned how to disconnect from my phone a bit and just live life on the present (pretty philosophical, huh?) New version is pretty sleek looking and nice, and selection of time in the free version is reasonable. You also have the option for a light block if you are at a stage where your willpower is good and you need to check one of your downloadable apps, which is cool.

I could see this really helping me achieve my goals by helping me get off my phone so much. I didn’t even have issues with my apps getting oh of order like others mentioned. However, the nuisance of having my notification settings reset every single time you go into “full lockdown” is enough for me to delete this app. There’s no easy fix for this. Every time to go into a different app the app prompts you if you’d like to turn notifications on or off as it does when you first install an app. And whatever your settings were for the notifications before full lockdown gets erased. For example: for my email app, I only have the badge notifications turned on. After using full lockdown and selecting “allow notifications” I then got a default notification (with sound) every single time I got an email. Which is like every other minute. Which caused me to look at my phone to see why it vibrated/made noise.

We've made improvements to your stats Calendar so that the current month loads a lot faster, and it's now easier to quickly compare your current month with the previous month. You can also now select a date from the calendar, and view, edit, or delete a session right there! \n\nAnd, in case you missed our last update, make sure to try Multitask Mode! It's a completely free feature we added to the Flipd timer. With Multitask enabled, you can start a Flipd session, then leave Flipd to read study notes, check your Notion app, open Quizlet, and do whatever you need to do while Flipd keeps running in the background! It's super convenient if you're a multitasker like we are. Concerned about getting distracted? No problem! You can disable Multitask Mode in your Flipd Settings so that the feature is hidden from your timer. But if you're interested, look out for the adorable new icon for Multitask Mode!\n\nAlso, have you tried creating your own study room yet?
