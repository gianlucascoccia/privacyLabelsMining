        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>First of all, the developer(s) are amazingly responsive, helpful, patient, kind, and enthusiastic. Communication is a pleasure. I&#39;ve used the predecessor of this unique app in the past (Liptiki) and loved it. I&#39;ve also briefly checked out Wotja last year. Sadly, I was overseas and blew up my MacBook. For the past several months I missed playing with this software! Wotja is a totally different format, so it might take a couple launches for the workflow to sink-in. It&#39;s not a DAW (digital audio workstation). It&#39;s an otherworldly environment that helps inspired creativity . . . especialy within it&#39;s melodic ambient wheelhouse. Of course, users are not trapped on this new planet. We are able to use Wotja as a sketchpad and then continue developing in a DAW, if one so desires. At the very, very least . . . this app breaks through creative blockage and is FUN to use after climbing over a little learning curve. For the price . . . FREE . . . you can&#39;t beat this. I&#39;ve got my eyes on the paid version for the enhanced features. Tommy Zai gives this two thumbs up.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Wotja can be as simple as a visual and auditory experience that mixes written words and generative music. Wotja includes many pre-generated mixes and makes it easy for you to create random mixes with just a a couple touches.<br /><br />Wotja can also be a very deep modular environment where you can edit every aspect of your music and sound parameters. The music engine is very adaptive with rules and settings that you can set for how each part plays. The sound engine is where you get your hands dirty building and editing your modular “synth” creations using sound/tone sources, FX units, controllers and routing junctions.<br /><br />I don’t think I’ll ever get to explore all of Wotja’s features, but I do learn new things every day with the help of Intermorphic. Anytime I hit a wall, it gets knocked down pretty quick with explanations for those little things that aren’t readily apparent to me.<br /><br />If you are brave enough to take the dive into Wotja’s vast generative and modular music environment, understand that you have a vast amount of control and there is probably a setting that you can tweak to make your creation sound just the way you want.</p>

    Superb package for ambient music creation

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Wotja a complete package for the creation of ambient, generative music. Offering complete and comprehensive control of all parameters, it makes possible gorgeous, ambient music. As someone who has been creating this kind of music for a while, Wotja enables me to achieve my vision in ways no other software can. The monthly subscription model is a total steal; if you need support, it’s fast, technically sophisticated, and patient. The latter is important as I think I have asked every dumb question I can about the software. The support people are unfailingly friendly and very helpful. If you have the ambient gene, this package is for you,</p>

The next update will be on Jan 1st and it will be Wotja V21.0. There is no change to base level macOS requirement but TTS support requires macOS 14+.\n\nIMPORTANT FOR \"PRO\" SUBSCRIBERS: Back in May 2020 the \"Pro\" Feature Set (FS) Subscription went \"dual\" - meaning one Subscription worked in both iOS and macOS versions. At the same time we also gave a heads up that from January 1st 2021 onwards we would be increasing all existing \"Pro\" Subscriptions. The \"Pro\" Subscription is now $2.49/month (and has been for a while) and represents great value. Should you be an early \"Pro\" Subscriber on lower price we hope you choose to continue your \"Pro\" Subscription with Wotja V21.\n\nFor those that would prefer instead to convert to a paid-for app you might be interested in checking out \"Wotja Pro 21\" which is to be released January 1st 2021.

Communication is a pleasure. I've used the predecessor of this unique app in the past (Liptiki) and loved it. I've also briefly checked out Wotja last year. Sadly, I was overseas and blew up my MacBook. For the past several months I missed playing with this software! Wotja is a totally different format, so it might take a couple launches for the workflow to sink-in. It's not a DAW (digital audio workstation). It's an otherworldly environment that helps inspired creativity . . . especialy within it's melodic ambient wheelhouse. Of course, users are not trapped on this new planet. We are able to use Wotja as a sketchpad and then continue developing in a DAW, if one so desires. At the very, very least . . . this app breaks through creative blockage and is FUN to use after climbing over a little learning curve. For the price . . . FREE . . . you can't beat this. I've got my eyes on the paid version for the enhanced features.

Wotja includes many pre-generated mixes and makes it easy for you to create random mixes with just a a couple touches.\n\nWotja can also be a very deep modular environment where you can edit every aspect of your music and sound parameters. The music engine is very adaptive with rules and settings that you can set for how each part plays. The sound engine is where you get your hands dirty building and editing your modular “synth” creations using sound/tone sources, FX units, controllers and routing junctions.\n\nI don’t think I’ll ever get to explore all of Wotja’s features, but I do learn new things every day with the help of Intermorphic. Anytime I hit a wall, it gets knocked down pretty quick with explanations for those little things that aren’t readily apparent to me.\n\nIf you are brave enough to take the dive into Wotja’s vast generative and modular music environment, understand that you have a vast amount of control and there is probably a setting that you can tweak to make your creation sound just the way you want.","title":"Generative/Modular/Expansive","userName":"T.j.V."},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4091435725","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-05-02T21:12:08Z","developerResponse":{"id":8517125,"body":"Thank you so much for your kind words - they really do mean a lot to us!

I think in 2020 it’s getting there. \n\nMy advice is to just get the basic subscription for a couple of months and start experimenting. The free version will let you hear the “kind of thing” Wotja” composes... but the limitations will end up confusing you. \n\nOnce you need a manual it’s all there on line in more detail than you expect! You can even move to the desktop if you want...when the overall  iOS music production implementation eventually cracks you! \n\nThe devs are very responsive and very nice. \n\nThere is nothing like this out there... and believe me I’ve looked. Sure, sometimes the GUI feels a bit unwieldy, sometimes I wish there was more built in selections of useful rules and probability sets ( to get going more quickly ), but as I said things are developing ( thanks for the Pattern Editor! )\n\nOther than hurting your mouth trying to say the name you have nothing to lose. Try it out. 😉\n\nPs the dev even reached out to make sure I could pronounce “Wotja” correctly!

The next update will be on Jan 1st and it will be Wotja V21.0. There is no change to base level macOS requirement but TTS support requires macOS 14+.\n\nIMPORTANT FOR \"PRO\" SUBSCRIBERS: Back in May 2020 the \"Pro\" Feature Set (FS) Subscription went \"dual\" - meaning one Subscription worked in both iOS and macOS versions. At the same time we also gave a heads up that from January 1st 2021 onwards we would be increasing all existing \"Pro\" Subscriptions. The \"Pro\" Subscription is now $2.49/month (and has been for a while) and represents great value. Should you be an early \"Pro\" Subscriber on lower price we hope you choose to continue your \"Pro\" Subscription with Wotja V21.\n\nFor those that would prefer instead to convert to a paid-for app you might be interested in checking out \"Wotja Pro 21\" which is to be released January 1st 2021. We *hope* we can make it available to pre-order before then but we are working to a very tight schedule.\n\nSee also this FAQ entry: https://intermorphic.com/help/#faq-wotja-pricing\n\nAs ever, if anything is not working right then please do get in touch via our Help Page ‘Contact Us’ options.\n\nP.S.
