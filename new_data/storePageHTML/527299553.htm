    Best travel app for frequent travelers

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>App In The Air fulfills all of my travel needs and more. Besides the ability to add (and automatically add) any flight and it’s relevant info like ticket numbers and confirmation numbers makes it extremely useful for regular trips and complicated itineraries such as multi ticket and multi city trips - it combines everything into one tool. I also love seeing the travel map and how it shows details like airlines and aircraft most frequently travelled. I have the premium features and they are useful, but the app without these features is extremely useful. <br /><br />Something I would love to see in the future: more detailed airport maps such as the ones you see in airline stock apps. Hot links in the airline/hotel/car rental section that take you to the company’s respective app (or a link to download). <br /><br />Overall this app is great for anyone who flies, especially for avgeeks like me who like to track their trips. I have a folder of paper tickets I like to collect but having everything on this app makes everything that much easier.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>​Hello! Thank you for your 5 stars review! We make every effort to be a useful travel assistant for you. This was our task - to create an application, which will be indispensable from the beginning of the journey to the end. In the future, there will be even more cool features. About maps: at the moment you can see interactive maps of airports in the application if such maps are on the websites of the airports themselves. To add installation links for airline applications is a great idea! I will definitely share it with our team. If you have any questions or other ideas related to the application, you can contact me 24/7 at vlad@appintheair.mobi. Vlad.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Been using this app for several years now, though I don’t travel much. I love the clean UI, just the ability to track flights alone is super nice. Love that it has consistently improved in UI, features, and support consistently. To have everything in one place and not miss updates on flights from different airlines is a huge stress  reliever. <br /><br />I love that there is a lifetime subscription option, to avoid annoying subscriptions which is what I opted for and younger competitors don’t offer.<br /><br />I personally encountered an annoying bug with Sign In with Apple in the app a long while ago. I reached out to the devs and Alex from support personally conversed with me over email quickly after. They said they would fix it and I forgot about it. Admittedly a long while later they did fix it! Funny enough I saw it in the update notes and wondered if it related to my issue and shortly later Alex followed up saying personally they fixed it. Thanks everyone!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been using App in the Air for around 8 years and great to see the developers offering enhancements such as being able to book flight and hotels.  Initially I was not impressed with the hotel booking as it seemed the prices were higher than dedicated travel sites like Priceline.  However in consulting with support, they told me the price listed is the total price including taxes and that almost always beats the other sites - I&#39;d suggest adding a note to that effect.  Another new enhancement is a C02 offset donation feature has been added to the profile tab.  Nice concept in principal but many airlines (esp. International Flights) already offset emissions under a UN agreement or the customer voluntarily pays an offset when booking.  Also, I often use the app to track other people’s flights and so it&#39;s not MY carbon footprint.  I&#39;d rather see a different enhancement such as an airport flight board.</p>

I will forward your suggestion on adding the tax information to the price to our developer team.

week, another update. Welcome to build 8.3.7! Halloween is inching closer, we’ve got pumpkin flavored drinks in our hands and dreaming of warmer destinations. That hasn’t stopped us from working through several bugs and enhancements to make the app better for you. Here are some things you may notice right away:\n\n+ Hotel booking improvements: We are always aiming to make your booking experience better, which is why we’ve made more enhancements to help you filter through your preferences quicker. Looking for a specific hotel star rating or a place near the city center? We’ve got you covered. Check it out and tell us what you think.\n\n+ No mo’ crashes: A few of you reported that the app was crashing on your profile or when adding flights. Oh, how annoying. Our team has been heads down fixing the bugs causing this issue and happy to say these have been fixed. Thank you to our loyal users who shared this feedback and our development team for taking care of this so fast! \n\nWe seem to have Rick Astley’s song stuck in our heads, so we’ll just end with “Never gonna give you up”... literally, because we love our community and always appreciate the feedback. *insert heart emoji*\n\n*Doing the Rick Astely dance* Come on, you know you have the song stuck in your head too now :)","releaseDate":"2021-10-25"},{"versionDisplay":"8.3.6","releaseNotes":"What’s more important than your morning coffee? Updates from your favorite travel app, duh. Just kidding, nothing is more important than coffee. Welcome to build 8.3.6! While this update is more about bug fixes and enhancements here are a few things you might notice right away:\n\n+ Hotel Booking Improvements: Remember that time you booked a hotel and realized you forgot to check if it included free breakfast or not? Well we’d never want you to have that experience so we’re excited to share that now when searching for hotels, you’ll clearly be able to identify if your room includes (or doesn’t include) breakfast options. #nevergohungry\n\n+ New search result badges: Making flight booking seamless is always our ultimate goal, which is why we’ve added new badges to help you identify whether a flight option is the cheapest, fastest, or even has a short layover. We’ve added several new identifiers here to keep you in the know so you can find that perfect flight for your trip. Yes, we knew you’d like this one. Start your flight search and tell us what you think!\n\n+ Updated notifications: We know you love receiving the amazing real-time notifications about your entire travel journey. But we realized that sometimes all you want to know is what’s going on with your flight. That’s why we’ve created a new category called “disruptions.” How do you activate it? Just go to your flight, select the flight alerts widget, tap subscribe and enter manually. Once you’re there, select disruptions and you’re ready. This is perfect for travelers who only want to know if there’s been a change to your flight…. So enjoy!\n\nLike what you see? Rate us five stars today.

This update includes new features designed to help you navigate travels during these pandemic times\n\n+Scanning your ID has never been easier: Missing numbers/alphabets or letters out of order -- that’s the annoyance we always felt while typing our passport numbers in the app. Well, the feeling is officially gone.

How easy is that? We knew you’d love it. Once again #travelsafe\n\n\n+Apple Watch updates: We always want you to stay in the know, especially on the go. That’s why we’ve enhanced notifications for Apple Watch users with the latest iOS15 changes. What does this mean? Now you’ll receive helpful notifications about your flight when you enter an airport zone. Flying out of Seattle? We’ll send you live updates once you enter Seattle-Tacoma international airport.

We’re excited to share that now you can book flights with Southwest Airlines directly in the app. This is months in the making and we’re proud to be one of the first travel assistants to add their flights to our app. Over the next few weeks we’ll be adding more features to this addition, so stay tuned! *high five*\n\n+Easy Trip Planning: Now you can seamlessly plan for future trips by saving them in the app. How?

Yes we know, we *heart* you too. \n\n+Catch the Gobble Gobble: We know you love achievements so to celebrate Thanksgiving we’ve hidden a little turkey for you to find. He may not be able to fly, but doesn’t mean he can’t hide. Good luck finding this butterball somewhere in the app and we’ll even give you a winners clap!\n\nEnjoyed these recent updates as much as we do? Rate and review us today.

The holidays are inching closer, the weather is getting cooler and we’re still dreaming of warmer destinations. That hasn’t stopped us from working through several bugs and enhancements to make the app better for you. Here are some things you may notice right away:\n\n+Calendar update issue: Several users reported an annoying issue where their calendars were getting a non-existent flight location update. No one wants to get a notification that doesn't give any value *yikes*. We’re happy to share this has been fixed!\n\n+Reworked several screens: Our goal is to always make the app as seamless as possible so we’ve reworked several screens for clarity and ease of use. We hope you like these as much as we do!\n\nAs Starship sang in the 80’s: “Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now” so keep the bugs coming and we’ll do everything we can to make the app better! In the meantime, if you like what you see, rate us five stars and we’ll have a (warm) drink in your honor.

In this release we've spent time fixing and refining a few things that were annoying, specifically ones you've emailed us about. Hopefully you find some things in this list that were your pet peeves. Nothing would make us happier than resolving them and making your life just that teeny bit better!   \n\n+ Updated iOS 14 widgets: We heard your feedback and excited to share that we’ve made some design updates to our iOS 14 widgets. Add the new version to your homescreen and tell us what you think!\n\n+ Updated aircraft widget: Thank you to folks who reported the issue with our aircraft widget!

Cheers to making your life easier, one bug fix at a time. \n\n+ Add a middle name while booking: Now you can add your middle name while booking flights or hotels. We read somewhere that 80% of people have middle names so seems like this is an important one *thinking face emoji*\n\nLove the recent updates as much as we do? Rate and review us today.

Besides the ability to add (and automatically add) any flight and it’s relevant info like ticket numbers and confirmation numbers makes it extremely useful for regular trips and complicated itineraries such as multi ticket and multi city trips - it combines everything into one tool. I also love seeing the travel map and how it shows details like airlines and aircraft most frequently travelled. I have the premium features and they are useful, but the app without these features is extremely useful. \n\nSomething I would love to see in the future: more detailed airport maps such as the ones you see in airline stock apps. Hot links in the airline/hotel/car rental section that take you to the company’s respective app (or a link to download). \n\nOverall this app is great for anyone who flies, especially for avgeeks like me who like to track their trips.

Initially I was not impressed with the hotel booking as it seemed the prices were higher than dedicated travel sites like Priceline.  However in consulting with support, they told me the price listed is the total price including taxes and that almost always beats the other sites - I'd suggest adding a note to that effect.  Another new enhancement is a C02 offset donation feature has been added to the profile tab.  Nice concept in principal but many airlines (esp. International Flights) already offset emissions under a UN agreement or the customer voluntarily pays an offset when booking.  Also, I often use the app to track other people’s flights and so it's not MY carbon footprint.  I'd rather see a different enhancement such as an airport flight board.","title":"Happy Long-Time User with Suggestions","userName":"markbyrn"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4238588771","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-05-31T05:21:20Z","developerResponse":{"id":8956764,"body":"Hello, Grant.

That makes auto check-in useless (I had to go into the American app and reselect my seat, which was fortunately still available). For flight info and updates it’s handy: automatically detected my reservations from my email so there was no data entry. It didn’t pick up the correct seat assignment from my American Airlines reservations (e.g. 12F instead of 12B somehow on one flight), but it was easy enough to edit that, and I’d use my boarding pass on the plane anyway. It also let me know about a lounge at STL I didn’t know about before, although it wasn’t in the terminal I was going to. It’s managed to replace Kayak as my source of flight info, although Kayak is free. I hope auto checkin gets more reliable, because it would be handy if I could trust it to not thoroughly screw up my prepaid seat assignment.","title":"Hit and miss","userName":"G-Mo"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3531799853","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-12-15T03:18:08Z","developerResponse":{"id":6403844,"body":"Hello Doc. My name is Alex, I'm from App in the Air team. Let me thank you for your review. Glad to hear the info in the App is useful for you. The idea of our timeline is to separate all the stages of the flight on the current moment of time. So if you preparing for your flight, you will see the status of departure. At the airport, you will see the current airport statuses. And after the landing, you will see your landing statuses, including the gate of arrival. So do you want to sell all the stages of the flight on one page? Maybe there will be a lot of info on one screen in this kind of design? For checking your route during the flight you need the internet. You can't get the data on the map without the online status. But you can see your approximate position on the map. We are loading the last information about the flight when you open it before the flight, this also applies to the flight map. In any case, we are actively developing and improving our app according to revi\r\news. Thank you very much. We will see how to make the timeline screen more convenient, and the map more informative.

This app is great to predict potential delays and also track my overall progress and other stats (types of planes, milestones, etc). The only negative is how it displays the current flight status as tiles where I have to swipe to see the anticipated arrival gate, etc and the location of the plane midnight doesn’t provide a map since I’m not hooked up to the internet. This is where Tripit and FlightRadar24 best this app out respectively. Tripit provides a really quick snapshot of what I have to do and where I need to go. While FlightRadar pretty much provides near real time data on the plane among other things. True, flightradar also needs WiFi, but it provides far more useful information when connected such as weather along the flight path, where other flights are coming from, etc. I typically use this app, flightradar, and Tripit to predict delays.

However, I have the impression that to fully utilize the functionality it needs a _lot_ of sensitive access - for example, I found its import from Tripit wasn’t complete when I added plans to Tripit after my initial connection to the service.  That is all I’m willing to give it now. \n\nAlso, it’s kind of a hacker’s playground. I see the features, but I’m too technical to want to find out what doesn’t work without knowing how things are implemented before I spend time (and get “locked in” to) a new thing. I wish the documentation was better, but I realize that most people will just be sold on it and give it a try without my level of expectations and privacy concerns. To wit:\n\nI’m wary about letting any app simply try to parse through my email continually looking for travel receipts. If it is possible (and it may be, but wasn’t obvious) to set up an address just from which plans could be email-forwarded (as with Tripit) it would be a fine alternative. If I were paying for Tripit’s subscription features, and it was clear I could set up an address as mentioned above (accept and process forwarded mail,  but you aren’t getting credentials to pull from that account), I’d be very inclined to drop Tripit for App In The Air, but my needs at this point don’t justify it. \n\nI like the app, wish you luck, and will look forward to seeing it get better.","title":"Good, but tries to do too much","userName":"K.

Welcome to build 8.3.7! Halloween is inching closer, we’ve got pumpkin flavored drinks in our hands and dreaming of warmer destinations. That hasn’t stopped us from working through several bugs and enhancements to make the app better for you. Here are some things you may notice right away:\n\n+ Hotel booking improvements: We are always aiming to make your booking experience better, which is why we’ve made more enhancements to help you filter through your preferences quicker. Looking for a specific hotel star rating or a place near the city center? We’ve got you covered. Check it out and tell us what you think.\n\n+ No mo’ crashes: A few of you reported that the app was crashing on your profile or when adding flights. Oh, how annoying.

While this update is more about bug fixes and enhancements here are a few things you might notice right away:\n\n+ Hotel Booking Improvements: Remember that time you booked a hotel and realized you forgot to check if it included free breakfast or not? Well we’d never want you to have that experience so we’re excited to share that now when searching for hotels, you’ll clearly be able to identify if your room includes (or doesn’t include) breakfast options. #nevergohungry\n\n+ New search result badges: Making flight booking seamless is always our ultimate goal, which is why we’ve added new badges to help you identify whether a flight option is the cheapest, fastest, or even has a short layover. We’ve added several new identifiers here to keep you in the know so you can find that perfect flight for your trip. Yes, we knew you’d like this one. Start your flight search and tell us what you think!\n\n+ Updated notifications: We know you love receiving the amazing real-time notifications about your entire travel journey. But we realized that sometimes all you want to know is what’s going on with your flight. That’s why we’ve created a new category called “disruptions.” How do you activate it? Just go to your flight, select the flight alerts widget, tap subscribe and enter manually. Once you’re there, select disruptions and you’re ready. This is perfect for travelers who only want to know if there’s been a change to your flight…. So enjoy!\n\nLike what you see? Rate us five stars today.

That hasn’t stopped us from working through several bugs and enhancements to make the app better for you. Here are some things you may notice right away:\n\n+Calendar update issue: Several users reported an annoying issue where their calendars were getting a non-existent flight location update. No one wants to get a notification that doesn't give any value *yikes*. We’re happy to share this has been fixed!\n\n+Reworked several screens: Our goal is to always make the app as seamless as possible so we’ve reworked several screens for clarity and ease of use.

Cheers to making your life easier, one bug fix at a time. \n\n+ Add a middle name while booking: Now you can add your middle name while booking flights or hotels.
