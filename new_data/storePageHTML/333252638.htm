ForeFlight is the essential, integrated flight app that makes planning, flying, and logging flights a joy.\n\nForeFlight delivers advanced flight planning capabilities, terminal procedure charts, enroute navigation charts, moving map, synthetic vision, hazard awareness, optional Jeppesen charts, a comprehensive library of market-leading weather information and visualization features, a large library of advanced aircraft performance profiles, customizable checklists, integration with a wide range of certified avionics and portable ADS-B and GPS receivers for inflight weather and data, a built-in documents catalog and cloud document capability for management of aircraft and flight operations publications, an easy-to-use pilot logbook for keeping track of flight experience, and so much more. ForeFlight is backed by our Pilot Support Team who delivers amazingly fast, accurate, and friendly customer service.\n\nPlease note: Location is used to enable a moving map and to record track logs, the camera is used to attach photos to logbook, push notifications are used for important bulletins and flight alerts, and contacts are used to add people to flights.\n\nForeFlight requires a subscription. Visit our website for more information on the available plan levels.\n\n\nFLIGHT PLANNING, BRIEFING, &amp; FILING\nPlan flights with Touch Planning on the Map or full-featured form-based Flights view. Tap out a route in seconds and quickly see if flights will be affected by weather or TFRs. Helpful Route, Altitude, and Procedure Advisors make planning easy and accurate. Generate a graphical preflight briefing and file your flight plan directly from the app. Print a professional-grade Navlog for inflight reference.\n\nWEATHER\nInteractive weather layers include animated radar, global satellite and winds aloft, global icing, turbulence, and surface analysis, graphical AIR/SIGMETs, flight category, visibility, and more. View decoded METARs, TAFs, and MOS forecasts. Thoughtfully organized Imagery view puts a full range of forecast tools at your fingertips.\n\nPLATES, CHARTS, &amp; MAPS\nBoth VFR and IFR operations are covered with all of the essentials required for planning and navigation: data-driven Aeronautical Maps, VFR Sectionals, High/Low Enroute charts, SIDs, STARs, approach and taxi charts, and terrain, satellite, and street map views.\n\nGEO-REFERENCED APPROACHES &amp; TAXI CHARTS\nPlates and taxi charts enable the real time display of your GPS location on the chart. They can also be overlaid on the Maps view along with weather and hazards for the ultimate situational awareness.\n\nGLOBAL HAZARD AWARENESS TECHNOLOGY\nPlan and fly with more confidence in all conditions and terrain.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>FF is easily the best app for aviation. I have all others, and they are not bad, some even good (eg GP), but I will not leave home without FF. Connecting to various Garmin devices now makes it a great in flight manager as well. I am glad that emphasis is placed on pre-flight management in this update. While flying multiple aircraft in various conditions, different performances, loads, settings, it is all adjusted on the fly through a pilot centered, intuitive interface. This makes keeping track of all data pertinent to a flight, as well as briefing, filing and tracking the flight as easy as can be. As an app goes, it is not cheap like a 2.99 game, but as an essential, reliable tool it is the cheapest utility around in all of aviation. In a world where we measure things in AMU’s, this app and it’s subscription fees are nothing to cry about, and in my opinion the subscription fee is the least I can contribute to keep this ForeFlight team eager to improve and grow. <br /><br />My only concern is not related to FF, but more related to the iPad and its very short life cycle before obsolescence. I am already concerned about what will happen when iPads cease to exist. For now, i am including a new iPad every other year to the price of doing business.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>We fly 12 to 18 hours per week with ForeFlight and Stratus 2. ForeFlight has come along way since it’s introduction with synthetic vision, excellent integration with Stratus and so much more.  I did get concerned with the previous version as we started having multiple crashes on two different newer iPads daily. We do load multiple waypoint and it seemed like that might have been a factor?  I always make sure my iPad has plenty of open SSD space and the newer iPads have 2GB or more RAM, so I wonder if the software rolled out too fast?  We’re also very careful about not updating the OS until the all clear is given. I just hope ForeFlight’s team slows down a little on all the bells and whistles. It’s much more crucial for the product to work flawlessly versus having 3D views of airports / etc. All in all ForeFlight is the BEST aviation App on the market and their team is obviously awesome at coding. My concerns and comments here about previous crashes are only because we’re addicted to ForeFlight and never want to see it burdened with issues. The new version seems to be more stable with only the rare crash. It does open back up in seconds right were you left off. Keep up the good work. Thanks ForeFlight!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Early in my flying career, shortly after my first solo but before my ppl check ride I was saved by Foreflight. Flying solo, I was out practicing maneuvers and not paying any attention to the weather that was coming in behind me, and covering the airport I was to return to. When it was time to come back I pointed the nose toward my home base and before I really knew what I had done, I flew vfr into imc. No where near instrument  rated I was truly lost in a sea of white. Thankfully I had Foreflight on my iPad with synthetic vision and the stratus 2 feeding attitude information. I transitioned to flying the plane like a video game watching that screen. I was able to keep the plane under control and maneuver though and out of the imc to and alternate airport and land safely. It was an absolutely terrifying event for me. I truly believe the outcome would not have been even close  to this had Foreflight not been in the cockpit with me. For this I am truly thankful and fly with Foreflight on every flight. Through the years Foreflight has only increased its capabilities and has never let me down. I recommend it to everyone who flies. Thanks for a great product and saving my life.</p>

Tap the Layer Selector button in the lower-left of each one to enable Obstacles.\n\t•\tForeFlight displays three types of obstacles: buildings (shaped like rectangles), towers (shaped like cylinders), and windmills. All other obstacle types use the tower model by default.\n\t•\tEnabling Night Mode in 3D Airports adds steady or flashing lights to obstacles that have them. Obstacle lights are red by default, but may also be white.\n\t•\t3D Preview helps you identify potentially hazardous obstacles within 1 nautical mile of your route by highlighting them with yellow or red stripes based on your current Hazard Altitude settings (1000’ vertically for yellow and 100’ vertically for red, by default).\n\t•\t3D View with Obstacles and more is included in ForeFlight Performance subscription plans.\u2028\n\nTrack Log Editing\n\t•\tEdit your recorded Track Logs to more accurately reflect the beginning and end of your flights and automatically update Logbook entries.\n\t•\tTap the Edit button in the bottom-right of the Track Log Graph to enter Edit mode. If the graph is hidden, tap the button at the far-right end of the timeline to reveal it.\n\t•\tIn Edit mode you can drag blue bars on the left and right sides of the graph to move the track log’s start and end points. These changes are also reflected on the overhead map above.\n\t•\tWhile in Edit mode you can still pinch to zoom within the Track Log Graph and drag left or right to focus on different portions of the track log. Tap-hold on the graph to reveal a moveable cursor with “Start Here” and “End Here” buttons at the top; tap either of these to set the respective end of the track log at that point.\n\t•\tTap Done to confirm the new end points and update the Track Log Graph, overhead map, and track log metrics available in the Info menu in the top-right.\n\t•\tTrack Log editing is non-destructive, so you can revert your changes or make additional edits at any time simply by tapping the Edit button again.\n\t•\tIf a Track Log is associated with a Logbook draft entry, trimming the track log will automatically update the auto-filled fields in the Logbook entry. Sending a trimmed track log to Logbook will similarly use the new end points for auto-filled fields.\u2028\n\nOptimized Downloads in Pack\n\t•\tPacking before your flight now requires a smaller download for weather by limiting the extent of the Icing, Turbulence, and Cloud Coverage layers downloaded to only areas that overlap with your route.\n\t•\tBoth the U.S.-only and Global versions of each layer are packed for flights within the U.S., giving you more forecast information for inflight reference while drastically cutting down the required download size.\u2028\n\nNotification Preferences\n\t•\tOpt-in to receive notifications about new feature releases, special offers on subscriptions, events, training, and more by enabling Marketing Push Notifications in More \u003e Account \u003e Notifications.\u2028\n\nJeppesen Chart Index Numbers\n\t•\tView the chart index number along with a chart’s name for linked or purchased Jeppesen coverages to quickly find the right procedure.\n\t•\tChart index numbers are shown in Airport Procedures, the Maps Sidebar, and the Plates view.\n\t•\tEnable this setting at the bottom of More \u003e Jeppesen.\u2028\n\nBackground Downloads Setting\n\t•\tOptionally disable background downloads to prevent them from being interrupted and restarting due to a slow or spotty internet connection.\n\t•\tThe switch to disable Background Downloads is available in More \u003e Settings \u003e Downloads, just below the Automatic Downloads setting switch.","releaseDate":"2021-08-03"},{"versionDisplay":"13.5","releaseNotes":"Hold Advisor\n\t•\tEasily insert a holding pattern anywhere in your route with flexible parameters and automatic pattern entry selection.\n\t•\tAccess Hold Advisor from within Procedure Advisor to insert a hold just before your destination airport, or tap on any waypoint in your route or elsewhere on the map to add a hold at that location.\n\t•\tHold Advisor provides parameters for inbound or outbound legs, the pattern’s length (defined by either time or distance), left or right turns, and optional altitude, speed, and EFC settings.\n\t•\tAfter adding the holding pattern to your route you can tap its bubble in the FPL Editor to make additional changes to it. \n\t•\tForeFlight does not yet support sending holding patterns to connected avionics via Flight Plan Transfer.\n\t•\tHold Advisor is included in Pro Plus subscriptions and above.\u2028\n\nAugmented Procedures™\n\t•\tQuickly find, select, and display the appropriate minimums for an approach to supplement the approach plate and reduce the risk of errors.\n\t•\tAfter selecting an approach and transition in Procedure Advisor the Minimum section appears below, with fields for Aircraft Approach Category and Equipment Status, where you can specify if any of the airport’s approach systems like ALS or RAIL are inoperative.\n\t•\tUsing this information and high-quality Jeppesen procedure data, ForeFlight will display the relevant minimums for each approach type that may be used for the approach, along with any applicable restriction notes for each.

I have all others, and they are not bad, some even good (eg GP), but I will not leave home without FF. Connecting to various Garmin devices now makes it a great in flight manager as well. I am glad that emphasis is placed on pre-flight management in this update. While flying multiple aircraft in various conditions, different performances, loads, settings, it is all adjusted on the fly through a pilot centered, intuitive interface. This makes keeping track of all data pertinent to a flight, as well as briefing, filing and tracking the flight as easy as can be. As an app goes, it is not cheap like a 2.99 game, but as an essential, reliable tool it is the cheapest utility around in all of aviation. In a world where we measure things in AMU’s, this app and it’s subscription fees are nothing to cry about, and in my opinion the subscription fee is the least I can contribute to keep this ForeFlight team eager to improve and grow. \n\nMy only concern is not related to FF, but more related to the iPad and its very short life cycle before obsolescence. I am already concerned about what will happen when iPads cease to exist. For now, i am including a new iPad every other year to the price of doing business.","title":"Foreflight: Essential and best value in all of aviation!","userName":"Visth"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3782539224","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-02-18T00:14:52Z","developerResponse":{"id":7366586,"body":"Hello IFR-Pilot.

ForeFlight has come along way since it’s introduction with synthetic vision, excellent integration with Stratus and so much more.  I did get concerned with the previous version as we started having multiple crashes on two different newer iPads daily. We do load multiple waypoint and it seemed like that might have been a factor?  I always make sure my iPad has plenty of open SSD space and the newer iPads have 2GB or more RAM, so I wonder if the software rolled out too fast?  We’re also very careful about not updating the OS until the all clear is given. I just hope ForeFlight’s team slows down a little on all the bells and whistles. It’s much more crucial for the product to work flawlessly versus having 3D views of airports / etc. All in all ForeFlight is the BEST aviation App on the market and their team is obviously awesome at coding. My concerns and comments here about previous crashes are only because we’re addicted to ForeFlight and never want to see it burdened with issues. The new version seems to be more stable with only the rare crash. It does open back up in seconds right were you left off. Keep up the good work.

Flying solo, I was out practicing maneuvers and not paying any attention to the weather that was coming in behind me, and covering the airport I was to return to. When it was time to come back I pointed the nose toward my home base and before I really knew what I had done, I flew vfr into imc. No where near instrument  rated I was truly lost in a sea of white. Thankfully I had Foreflight on my iPad with synthetic vision and the stratus 2 feeding attitude information. I transitioned to flying the plane like a video game watching that screen. I was able to keep the plane under control and maneuver though and out of the imc to and alternate airport and land safely. It was an absolutely terrifying event for me. I truly believe the outcome would not have been even close  to this had Foreflight not been in the cockpit with me. For this I am truly thankful and fly with Foreflight on every flight. Through the years Foreflight has only increased its capabilities and has never let me down. I recommend it to everyone who flies.

Transferring all the time takes some work and I had numerous questions, not only about how to use the system, but how to log things jet sim time, etc. I asked questions and got immediate answers from experienced pilots, at least one of whom served as Chief Pilot for a commercial operation, so he knew the regs cold and pointed me to the proper FAA references.

They took something so streamlined, quick, and easy as flight planning and made it cumbersome and ungainly.  It's no longer simple to make a few little changes and see how it affects the flight.  You have to load and create performance profiles.  It's like they never even considered you might fly a different speed or TAS at different altitudes.  Not to mention not everyone wants to waste time with creating a whole new profile when you just want to see how changing one number changes the flight.  AND not everyone only flies one airplane!  These last two updates ruined the best thing about foreflight.  Now they've also ruined your map screen.  All the colors have shifted and seem to be permanently stuck on night mode.  No setting will change it back.  Now you can barely read TAFs and metars in the daylight.  On top of everything else the app crashes at least once a flight now, and if it doesn't crash you have to restart it any time it loses communication with your ADS-B unit because it won't reconnect or show any data or even the device unless you restart the app. Talk about going backwards.","title":"Foreflight: ruining an app one update at a time","userName":"Wastintime"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3642537099","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-01-12T19:27:54Z","rating":5,"review":"As a career software developer/designer, I’ve seen many times where software makes life easier, or more efficient.

However, there are two glaring issues I have with the application, especially when compared to the competitors (primarily Garmin Pilot). To start off, the screen frame-rate is capped at either 24 or 30 FPS. The app feels laggy due to this. This is especially upsetting if you have the latest Apple devices (such as the iPhone XS and especially the iPad Pro) that can do 60 FPS and 60+ FPS respectively. Secondly, the map resolution could be sharper, and isn’t optimized for particular devices. The sectional (or zoomed out En-route IFR chart) view is pixelated on my iPhone XS and does not sharpen up until it becomes a TAC. Even then, the map isn’t as sharp as it is on Garmin Pilot. Updating these two features would be excellent for me, and would change my 3-star review to a 5-star review.
