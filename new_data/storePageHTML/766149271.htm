        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So far it seems like a worthwhile investment. I’ve only just started to use it regularly after having it for a month and have just been figuring out its uses. The games are somewhat challenging. I enjoy the positive talks and find them inspiring while also showing me I could make my own. After two days I have learned how to sign the alphabet and that is something I have been talking about doing for 6 months. I will be diving deeper into this app while continuing to practice the features I have found already. I do find it expensive, but if you think about how ridiculously priced private college is this is a cheap way to learn skills that can pad your resume and make you stand out amongst other candidates.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app is fun. The cool little articles are interesting. The problem is very few of them are based on fact. They just go for sensationalism. It’s like going to the national inquirer for news. Most of their math problems have errors. The facts of their stories are certainly not checked. If there’s an internet meme they’ll publish it as fact. I saw one last week that talks about how wonderful woman is the oldest superhero comic besides Superman and Batman. Um, there are dozens superheroes older than that we still have around. Try captain America, the green lantern, all the avengers, aqua man, green arrow, all the fantastic 4 (though they weren’t a team yet, the list goes on too long for here. I see scientific “discoveries” that are decades old and disproven pretty much that long ago. They need to hire an actual editor for their stories before they go publishing random stuff. At least if they are claiming it’s non-fiction. I’m sorry if you are the “editor” of these things because they are full of misspellings, repeated paragraphs, missing parts of text, and general wrong information. The math is the worst. I’d say do t let your kids use this for learning math. Please. We need an informed generation to help out this ailing planet.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I wanted to try it to see if I liked it so I signed up for the “free 7 day trial” and was charged $70 immediately. What the hell kind of free trial is THAT?! Applied for a refund through Apple so I’ll see how THIS goes. <br />Why are there so many reviews like this? It’s a cool app and I’ve used it up to the 8credits every day for a long time. Thought I’d check out what the full subscription offered me. Now I’m pretty upset. I don’t have that $70 I can spare until next week when the app would renew. Terribly misleading to say the least.<br /><br />*update* I WAS charged and I contacted Apple. They immediately (it showed as a refund the next business day) refunded me the full amount. Whatever issue Curious has with Apple on this matter really should be rectified because it’s not just me that it happened to and now this issue overshadows any review for the actual app content and that’s a shame. <br />So besides THAT crappy glitch I enjoyed Curious. Sure, some people could find all the individual offerings of this app in other places perhaps but, will they? It IS a cool app with interesting diverse content based on your interests. Like a compiled news app, it’s nice to have what I didn’t know I was looking for yet presented to me in this format.</p>

User Consent.  By submitting Personal Data through our Service, you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n\n2. A Note About Children.  We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from visitors who are under the age of 13.\n\n3. A Note to Users Outside of the United States.  Your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country; by submitting Personal Data through our Service, you expressly consent to the foregoing.\n\n4. Types of Data We Collect.  \"Personal Data\" means data that allows someone to identify or contact you.  We collect information from you as described below.\n\n(a) Information You Provide to Us.\n\nIf you apply to become a teacher (\"Teacher\") we will collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number and any information you put into the subject section.\nIf you apply to become a student (\"Student\") we will collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, and e-mail address.\nIf you ever purchase Service on our Site, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, which may include your name, credit card information, and billing information.\nWe retain information on your behalf, such as files that you store (e.g., Lessons) and messages that you send (including the content of the message and the recipient data) using your account with us (\"Account\").\nIf you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.\nWhen you participate in one of our surveys or marketing promotions, we may collect additional profile information or other stuff.\nWhen you post messages on the message boards of our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it.\nWe may also collect Personal Data or other data at other places on our Site, in conjunction with new or additional features that are intended to assist Students in learning and Teachers in recruiting or teaching Students or to provide other services to you.\n\n(b) Information Collected via Technology.\n\nOur servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.\nWe also use cookies and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and which you viewed.  \"Cookies\" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a web site.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).  Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.\n(c) Social Networking Sites.  If you (i) log on to the Service with your login credentials from a social networking site (such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, or LinkedIn) (\"Social Networking Site\") or (ii) associate your Account with your account at a Social Networking Site, we may receive information about you from such Social Networking Site, in accordance with such Social Networking Site's terms of use and privacy policy (\"SNS Terms\").  We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via the Service.  If you elect to share your information with these Social Networking Site, we will share information with them in accordance with your election.  For example, but without limitation, you may elect to share your Lesson on Facebook.  The SNS Terms will apply to the information we disclose to them.\n\n(d) Google Analytics.  We currently use Google Analytics.  Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors.  Google Analytics uses its own cookie to track visitor interactions.  Website owners can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with their website so they can improve their website and how people find it.  We may also use Google Analytics to remarket our Site to you by serving ads on on our behalf on third party websites.  Please see the following links for more information about Google Analytics: www.google.com/analytics/, www.google.com/privacy.html, and www.google.com/analytics/tos.html.\n\n(e)\tAdvertisements.  We may also use third parties, such as Google, to serve ads on our behalf on third party websites. Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Site (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number). They do this by using Cookies, Pixel Tags or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertisements related to our Site by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Cookies or Pixel Tags in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: http://www.aboutads.info/choices.\n\n\n5. Use of Your Personal Data. We use your Personal Data as described below and elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.\n\n(a) General Use.  We only use the Personal Data you submit to us to respond to requests that you make, to aid us in serving you better, and in the following ways: (1) to facilitate the creation of and secure your Account on our network; (2) to identify you as a user in our system and remember your preferences and the progress you have made using our system; (3)  to improve the quality of experience when you interact with our Service; (4) to send you a welcome e-mail to verify ownership of the e-mail address provided when your Account was created, and to help you get started using Curious; (5) to send you administrative e-mail notifications, such as security or support and maintenance advisories; (6) to respond to your inquiries and requests; (7) to make telephone calls to you, from time to time, as a part of secondary fraud protection or to solicit your feedback; and (8) to send newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials related to our Service and for other marketing purposes of Curious.\n\n(b) Creation of Anonymous Data.  We may create anonymous data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you.  We use this anonymous data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Service and improve Site navigation.  Curious reserves the right to use anonymous data for any purpose and disclose anonymous data to third parties in its sole discretion.\n\n\n6. Disclosure of Your Personal Data.  We disclose your Personal Data as described below and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.\n\n(a) Profile Information. The following profile information about Teachers is public: the Teacher's first and last name and any biographical information that the Teacher chooses to show in his/her public profile through the privacy settings on the Site.  The following profile information about Students is public: the Student's first and last name or the handle that the Student chooses to show in his/her public profile and the Lessons that the Student has \"enrolled\" in and the Student's progress in such Lessons (e.g., how far, how many exercises, and how many completed assignments).\n\n(b) Third Party Service Providers.  We may share your Personal Data with third party service providers to: provide you with the Service that we offer you through our Site; to conduct quality assurance testing; to facilitate creation of accounts; to provide technical support; to provide billing/payment services, and/or to provide other services to Curious.  These third party service providers are required not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by Curious.\n\n(c) Affiliates and Acquisitions  We may share some or all of your Personal Data with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (\"Affiliates\"), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.  If another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, including in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy\n\n(d) Other Disclosures.  Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below), Curious may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary (a) in connection with any legal investigation; (b) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Curious; (c) to protect or defend the rights or property of Curious or users of the Service; and/or (d) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or Terms of Use.\n\n\n7. Third Party Websites.  When you click on a link to any other website or location, you will leave our Site and go to another site and another entity may collect information from you.  We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content.  Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on links to such outside websites.  For the avoidance of doubt, YouTube is a third party website.  To the extent any content provided through YouTube is used in any lessons on the Service, YouTube's privacy policy governs YouTube's collection, use and disclosure of your information in connection with such content in the lesson.\n\n\n8. Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Data\n\n(a) Choices.  We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data.  We will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our Service.  When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to \"opt-out\" by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below). Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you service related communication, including notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.\n\n(b) Changes to Personal Data.  You may change any of your Personal Data in your Account by editing your profile within your Account.  You may request deletion of your Personal Data by us, but please note that we may be required to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).  When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives.  We may retain your information for fraud prevention or similar purposes.\n\n9. Security of Your Personal Data.  Curious is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data.  We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, modification, use, disclosure, or deletion.  We also require you to enter a password to access your Account information. Please do not disclose your Account password to unauthorized people.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, you acknowledge that while Curious uses reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Data, Curious cannot guarantee or warrant the security of your Personal Information or that the information on the Service may not be accessed, modified, used, disclosed, or deleted by unauthorized persons.\n\n10.

I saw one last week that talks about how wonderful woman is the oldest superhero comic besides Superman and Batman. Um, there are dozens superheroes older than that we still have around. Try captain America, the green lantern, all the avengers, aqua man, green arrow, all the fantastic 4 (though they weren’t a team yet, the list goes on too long for here. I see scientific “discoveries” that are decades old and disproven pretty much that long ago. They need to hire an actual editor for their stories before they go publishing random stuff. At least if they are claiming it’s non-fiction. I’m sorry if you are the “editor” of these things because they are full of misspellings, repeated paragraphs, missing parts of text, and general wrong information. The math is the worst.
