    Falls Short for $300 a year
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>There are several quirks and shortcomings that make E6 connect not worth $300 a year. <br /><br />1.) You can not have a custom set of clubs. You are stuck with Driver, 3 &amp; 5 wood, 4 hybrid, 4-9 iron, PW, GW, SW, putter. My clubs are Driver, 5 wood, 3-5 hybrid, 6-9 iron, PW, GW, 56 &amp; 60 degree, putter. This makes using the driving range to get data on your bag of clubs impossible. So I don’t use the driving range. <br /><br />2.) Sand shots are a joke. You have to hit them like a regular chip shot and then they aren’t predictable. The same swing might go twice as far as the last time. It’s frustrating.<br /><br />3.) Putting isn’t even worth it. It’s extremely difficult to guess what 50, 30, 20 feet is in a virtual setting. I’d prefer having the option of having a chipping target like some programs offer, instead of putting.<br /><br />4.) Changing your aiming direct is incredibly problematic. Point the arrow in the direction you want isn’t that bad, but trying to determine a layup yardage past 100 yards is unbearably finicky. The target post move of the screen after 100 yards and to try and control it you have to roll your finger tip to keep the target post from flying off the screen. It’s ridiculous. <br /><br />5.) I’ve played 4 rounds and had two of them completely crash on the back nine. The app just closes. The game is gone and you can’t resume. <br /><br />Hopefully there will an app update soon to make this more enjoyable.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Got this software with my Mevo Plus, which I use with an iPad Pro.<br /><br />In my mind, I just assumed that once I had the app and the device, I would open the app, turn on the Mevo, and play golf.<br /><br />Nope. That’s not how it works. What happens is an unclickable warning flashes in the upper left that says “Device not connected.”<br /><br />Again, not clickable, so very unhelpful. So, you then click through EVERY LINK IN THE APP looking for anything helpful like “connect to device.”<br /><br />Nope! Nada! You can’t make this stuff up. Connecting to a device it’s supposedly made to work with is an action that is COMPLETELY MISSING FROM THE APP.<br /><br />So you close the app, turn off the device. Turn on the device, open the app. Move the device closer, spin the device in circles, turn it upside down... nothing.<br /><br />I finally resorted to just using the FS app for practice, after which I checked the E6 software and Voila! It was magically connected. So, I tried it out.<br /><br />Distance to target in metric, no problem, think I, SURELY they can’t screw up how to change that!<br /><br />Well, yes they sure can! When you go to Settings&gt; Measurement there is a super helpful drop down titled “Unused” that DOESN’T DROP DOWN.<br /><br />So, metric only, because that field is “unused,” whatever in the world that means.<br /><br />So if you were hoping to get this app, and turn on you Mevo Plus and play golf in, you know, yards, then GOOD LUCK!</p>

Unbind unbinds the license outright; Rebind only unbinds the current license if you log in again and choose a new license to bind to.\n-Profiles: Added a Handicap option in the Edit Profile Menu for players and even guests to set a manual handicap (in lieu of a future World Handicap System release).\n-Scorecard: Added Rating and Slope data.\n-Integrations: Added a new tracking system, Garmin.\n\nCHANGES\n-Settings: Split the Measurement setting into two independent options for more modular customization: Speed (MPH, KPH, or M/s) and Distance (Yards/Feet/Inches or Yards only, or Meters/Centimeters or Meters only).\n-Updated the Club Select button for improved visibility.\n-Post Shot Menu: Modified the green OK/Continue button to show the text and timer (if applicable) at the same time for more clear usability.\n-AutoCaddy: Adjusted the AutoCaddy system to use better club distances and also consider the user’s Tee.\n-Game Setup Menu: Improved how Teams are auto-assigned so that the default assignments are more balanced.\n-Audio: Music and other sounds now fade when entering or exiting a round.\n-Putting: The Putting Line should now show while on the Fringe if a putter is selected.\n-Resume Game: Sudden Death/tiebreaker games are now saved and can be resumed.\n-Closest to the Pin \u0026 Long Drive: Reverted the Top View to the standard (smaller) size (which was previously “jumbo” sized for a time).\n-Events: Implemented a tracking system filter to allow only showing Events that the currently set tracking system is eligible for (including Events with no restrictions).\n-Integrations - FlightScope: Set Ball on Screen as the default view for all FS devices.\n-Integrations: Disabled the Terrain Penalty for tracking systems that do not support it.\n\nBUG FIXES\n-Important fix: Fixed issues with scores failing to post online and failing to detect E6 reconnecting to the internet.\n-Important fix: Events: Fixed the Terrain Penalty UI not showing in Events.\n-Fixed the “Update Required” screen appearing on the latest version of the app.\n-Profiles - Remember Player: Added safeguards to fix a long-standing and elusive bug with corrupted saved players, which manifested as empty player slots, missing profile images, failure to properly load data, and a few other odd behaviors. If the offending profile(s) cannot be restored from locally stored data, the invalid profile is removed.\n-Settings: Fixed the License Type no longer showing the friendly name in the Info \u0026 Help section.\n-Sudden Death: Fixed scores using only hole 1’s scores instead of the final score before the tiebreaker. Fixed Sudden Death being offered if a player was dropped, and the assigned 12 strokes caused a (false) tie.\n-In-Round Practice: Fixed the selected club changing after each practice shot due to the AutoCaddy triggering. Fixed the elevation to pin indicator failing to update when moving the ball.\n-Resume Game: Fixed Best Ball scores turning up blank after resuming a saved round.\n-Scramble: Fixed the Top View showing behind the Final Results scorecard.

Fixed the score being able to exceed the intended cap of 12 strokes after hitting past the shot limit of 12. Fixed getting stuck in the Leaderboard at the end of a KP/LD game when a player leaves early. Fixed getting stuck after locking and locking screen.\n\n*Due to Apple's 4,000 character limit, some lesser bug fixes and changes could not be included here.","releaseDate":"2021-07-19"},{"versionDisplay":"1.7.5","releaseNotes":"Important hotfix: Resolved an issue where many or most shots were not sending to the server, therefore failing to appear on Portal.

You can not have a custom set of clubs. You are stuck with Driver, 3 \u0026 5 wood, 4 hybrid, 4-9 iron, PW, GW, SW, putter. My clubs are Driver, 5 wood, 3-5 hybrid, 6-9 iron, PW, GW, 56 \u0026 60 degree, putter. This makes using the driving range to get data on your bag of clubs impossible. So I don’t use the driving range. \n\n2.) Sand shots are a joke. You have to hit them like a regular chip shot and then they aren’t predictable. The same swing might go twice as far as the last time. It’s frustrating.\n\n3.) Putting isn’t even worth it. It’s extremely difficult to guess what 50, 30, 20 feet is in a virtual setting. I’d prefer having the option of having a chipping target like some programs offer, instead of putting.\n\n4.) Changing your aiming direct is incredibly problematic. Point the arrow in the direction you want isn’t that bad, but trying to determine a layup yardage past 100 yards is unbearably finicky. The target post move of the screen after 100 yards and to try and control it you have to roll your finger tip to keep the target post from flying off the screen. It’s ridiculous. \n\n5.) I’ve played 4 rounds and had two of them completely crash on the back nine. The app just closes. The game is gone and you can’t resume. \n\nHopefully there will an app update soon to make this more enjoyable.","title":"Falls Short for $300 a year","userName":"Stavjoki"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7133428472","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-03-23T00:29:03Z","rating":2,"review":"Got this software with my Mevo Plus, which I use with an iPad Pro.\n\nIn my mind, I just assumed that once I had the app and the device, I would open the app, turn on the Mevo, and play golf.\n\nNope. That’s not how it works. What happens is an unclickable warning flashes in the upper left that says “Device not connected.”\n\nAgain, not clickable, so very unhelpful. So, you then click through EVERY LINK IN THE APP looking for anything helpful like “connect to device.”\n\nNope! Nada! You can’t make this stuff up. Connecting to a device it’s supposedly made to work with is an action that is COMPLETELY MISSING FROM THE APP.\n\nSo you close the app, turn off the device. Turn on the device, open the app. Move the device closer, spin the device in circles, turn it upside down... nothing.\n\nI finally resorted to just using the FS app for practice, after which I checked the E6 software and Voila! It was magically connected. So, I tried it out.\n\nDistance to target in metric, no problem, think I, SURELY they can’t screw up how to change that!\n\nWell, yes they sure can! When you go to Settings\u003e Measurement there is a super helpful drop down titled “Unused” that DOESN’T DROP DOWN.\n\nSo, metric only, because that field is “unused,” whatever in the world that means.\n\nSo if you were hoping to get this app, and turn on you Mevo Plus and play golf in, you know, yards, then GOOD LUCK!","title":"They ought to rename it E6 Disconnect","userName":"D Sherwin"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5229707849","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-12-03T20:06:15Z","rating":5,"review":"I love how easy it was to set up and understand how to use.  After about 15 minutes on the driving range I felt comfortable enough to try out the courses and in just a couple of holes in I was familiar with how each club was going to play and the distance I could get.  With the iPad it is more realistic and lets me play golf year-round(and inside which is great with this weather).  It is also awesome to be able to play at night with my wife after our son has gone to bed, something I will probably continue to do even when it gets warm out.

I mean terrible. I think dial-up internet was faster than this app.\n2. The “keep me logged in” function doesn’t actually keep you logged in. This leads to even more time having to login constantly. Of course Touch or FaceID aren’t options to speed that up on iOS devices.\n3. For Mevo+ users, login to E6 first, then pair your Mevo, then go back to E6.

The admin can choose to require a full login when accessing these settings, or set a PIN.\n-Added a new tracking system, the TruGolf Mini.\n\nChanges\n*See below\n\n\nBug Fixes\n-Fixed an issue where E6 Connect would disconnect from the internet at random times during use.\n-Fixed multiple bugs that caused crashes, hangs, or prevented progress.\n-Fixed several UI and menu behavior bugs.\n-Online Play: Fixed multiple bugs with game round logic, connectivity, and menus.\n\n*Full disclosure: This is far from an exhaustive list of the changes, bug fixes, and (minor) additions that this update includes due to an inability to compile all changes in time for the App Store submission.","releaseDate":"2019-10-16"},{"versionDisplay":"1.1.1","releaseNotes":"Additions\n-New major feature: Events!\n-New major feature: Shot Replays, accessed from the bottom of the Post Shot/Analyzer menu.\n-New Mode of Play: Match Play - Singles. In this popular golf format, a player or team is awarded a point for each hole in which they have bested their opponents.\n-New Mode of Play: Performance Team Stroke. This E6 Connect-only format has an important difference from traditional Stroke Play: the team score is the average stroke score of each team member per hole.\n-New feature: the Quick Access Menu. Found in the lower-left corner during play, this player-personalized menu allows you to easily toggle your point of view, mulligan the last shot, run a hole preview, hide the interface, and even change the Atmosphere setting, as well as toggle the putting line and terrain grid (while putting). Customize these under Profile Settings in the HUD tab.\n-Added ball collision sounds.\n-Added the ability to customize your device’s name under Info \u0026 Help \u003e About.\n-Added notifications to indicate when a connection to the internet is lost.\n\nChanges\n-Major change: All iOS Mobile Licenses have been converted to individual licenses to behave like -Desktop Licenses do now, where only one device can bind to one license. This should help with some issues and confusion from the old system.\n-Only authorized iOS courses are now listed in the Course Menu.\n-Changed Mulligan when selected from the *Pause Menu*. Instead of only undoing the current player’s last shot, it now undoes the last shot made on that hole, even if made by another player.\n-Changed Rehit to now end a player’s turn instead of letting them hit again immediately.\n-Major changes to Offline Mode: extended sessions from 5 to 16 hours, and entering Offline Mode now informs you of when it will expire.\n-Revamped the Game Setup Menu significantly.\n-Revamped the Club Select Menu found in-round.\n-Made many improvements to Unlimited Offline.\n-Smash Factor is now reported with two decimal places instead of one.\n-Adjusted some physics, namely to the ball skidding on the green.\n-Improved the Terrain Penalty system, which has now expanded to include earth, gravel, pavement, and wood terrain types. Small adjustments to the penalties in other terrain types were made.\n-Practice: Some Environment settings can now be changed while practicing.\n-Practice: Made multiple improvements to the Scoring Zone.\n-Online Play: Tweaked the lobby chat system to allow selecting who is sending the message.\n-Tracking Systems: Disabled wind and elevation settings for devices that don’t support or use them.\n-Many other (smaller) changes.\n\nBug Fixes\n-Licensing: Fixed some issues that could lead to a license unbinding.\n-Fixed the wind potentially having too much heading variance on a course.\n-Fixed iOS texture blending.\n-Best Ball \u0026 Scramble: Fixed holes in one breaking the game, and fixed player colors.\n-Scramble: Fixed being able to end a team members turn by pausing the game, and a few minor issues.\n-Practice: Fixed Scoring Zone targets bleeding into other greens.\n-Fixed some crashes that could occur when downloading courses or changing the music volume setting.\n-Fixed a variety of other issues, such as erroneous camera or aiming behaviors, settings menu bugs, and many other bugs.","releaseDate":"2019-08-08"},{"versionDisplay":"1.0.6","releaseNotes":"Additions\n-Practice - Driving Range: Added the Scoring Zone feature. It can be activated with the target button in the bottom-right corner, and the target can be moved with the button next to it. The HUD displays the shot accuracy and the % of shots that land (not stop) in each color. Moving the target resets all stats.\n-Stroke Play \u0026 Scramble: Implemented new tiebreaker options: Countback and Sudden Death (which uses the course’s 18th hole).\n-Stroke Play: Added Teams as an option in the Game Setup Menu before starting the round.

Thank you to those who gave us feedback!\n-Slightly widened the diameter of the cup (hole) to the official size. This should effectively make putting a bit easier and be more user-friendly.\n-Only the active player’s ball shows on the green now. Ball markers on the green will come in a future update.\n-Guests can no longer select a profile image, but instead are colored by their position in the roster (red, blue, yellow, etc.).\n-Practice: Removed the unneeded “Restart Round” button from the Exit Round Menu.\n-Scramble: Each team member’s individual score is now displayed in the Choose Best Shot Menu.\n-Tracking Systems - General: Added a battery indicator to the Main Menus for most devices that have a battery.\n-FlightScope: Revamped the Configuration Menu. The menu now lists all model categories; detected devices are found under the respective category (using its serial number). The Xi requires manual detection and connection; the X2 and X3 should be automatically detected.\n\nBug Fixes\n-Fixed the Update Available menu preventing E6 Connect from refreshing the number of available Offline Mode sessions.\n-Fixed a severe bug where viewing the Analyzer (Post Shot) from the pause menu after hitting the ball out of bounds or into water would bring up the Out of Bounds Menu or Water Hazard Menu again.\n-Fixed showing balls of players who have not teed off yet.\n-Fixed being able to turn the camera 360 degrees in Darts, Blackout, and the Driving Range.\n-Fixed the Aim Marker on the Top View reporting the wrong distance after a shot.\n-Fixed the Aim Marker resetting to its default location after pausing and unpausing.\n-Fixed elevation and distance indicators to convert to meters at 100 centimeters when set to Metric.\n-Fixed the Download All button becoming disabled after canceling download all courses.\n-Fixed the main menu music ending after entering the main menu from certain other menus.\n-Fixed being able to click the Home button when in the Terms of Service Menu while creating a new profile, yielding overlapped menus.\n-Blackout: Fixed the game sometimes getting stuck after a player’s turn ran out of time.\n-Scramble: Fixed the team score not being applied to each team member after the best ball was selected.\n-Scramble: Fixed a bug where a hole in one made by a player in a team could cause the game to get stuck and not move to the next turn.\n-Scramble: Fixed a bug where dropping the ball after a water hazard could cause the Choose Best Shot Menu to be skipped.\n-Scramble: Fixed using Pickup so that it removes the entire team from that hole and assigns 12 strokes (maximum) to the team’s score.\n-Ernest Sports: Fixed the device not being recognized when its name was set in lowercase. Case is now ignored.\n-Ernest Sports: Fixed a crash that would always occur after locking then unlocking the iOS device.\n-FlightScope: Fixed Smash Factor missing in the Post Shot Menu.\n-FlightScope: Fixed the Recalibrate button showing up during a flyby.\n\n*Due to the 4000 character limit, not all changes were able to be listed here.","releaseDate":"2019-03-25"},{"versionDisplay":"1.0.4","releaseNotes":"*Due to a 4000 character limit, not all changes are able to be listed here.\n\nAdditions\n-Added the ability to drag the Aim Marker.\n-Added Czech (Čeština) as a new language option.\n-Added in new Japanese translations.\n-Blackout: Added sounds for the seagull.\n\nChanges\n-Improved ball physics, namely regarding ball rolling when colliding with an object.\n-Adjusted the Putting Line option Align Break to only trigger within 50 yards of the pin.\n-Putting Modes (such as Gimme, Autoscore, etc.) now occur after the Post Shot Menu is closed, allowing the ability to use Mulligan or Rehit if needed.\n-Options in the Settings Menu that don’t apply to the game mode being set up currently are now disabled, which should help streamline the round customization process. For example, you won’t be able to change the Pin Position or Putting Mode for any Games as they aren’t needed for those modes. All settings are still available when accessed from the Main Menu. \n-Modified the Edit Display Name Menu to provide instructions for which characters are valid and an error message that appears if the user attempts to save the Display Name with invalid characters.\n-Changed the Booth Dimensions menu to display in separate feet and inches steppers.\n-The Booth Dimensions options Screen Width/Height can no longer exceed Booth Width/Height.\n-Significantly dampened the effect of soft collisions causing the ball to deflect or change direction.\n-Chip \u0026 Putt: Regular HUD elements are now toggled off while placing the ball or flag.\n-Closest to the Pin/Long Drive: Attempts now count down like they do in Blackout and Darts instead of counting up.\n-Darts: The score now updates live upon ball impact, as it does in Blackout.\n-Practice: The Deviation and Dispersion player stats now toggle between Rollout and Impact data tables every five seconds.\n\nBug Fixes\n-Fixed the terrain type of many tee boxes to report as Tee instead of Fairway.\n-Repositioned the Wind Indicator to not overlap other HUD information in Chip \u0026 Putt.\n-Fixed Demo Flybys returning to the Main Menu instead of the Settings Menu after being run manually.\n-Fixed Demo Flybys being able to trigger while a course download is in progress.\n-Fixed Demo Flybys attempting to load a course that is not authorized and subsequently failing.\n-Fixed other minor issues where launching Demo Flybys while in certain menus could cause buggy menu or button states.\n-Fixed the Download All button in the Courses Menu to no longer be active when a download is in progress.\n-Fixed an issue where the file downloader could get caught in an infinite loop, preventing download completion.\n-Fixed the course file size showing the wrong total size when resuming a paused download.\n-Fixed the License Expiration Calendar widget (next to the Home button) reporting as a negative value.\n-Fixed the side spin arrow to show the correct spin direction on the ball graphic in the Post Shot Menu.\n-Fixed the Club Face in the Post Shot Menu to report the correct open and closed positions for left-handed golfers.\n-Fixed the Putting Line and Terrain Grid turning on before and during the Post Shot Menu.\n-Fixed the Putting Line being able to draw from the Tee Box or other Greens in rare cases.\n-Fixed an issue where skipping a player could cause the distance to the Aim Marker to show incorrect values.\n-Blackout/Darts: Fixed being able to click the terrain and pause button when the “Are You Ready?” dialog is up.\n-Blackout/Darts: Fixed the “Are You Ready?” dialog appearing over Demo Flybys if launched after a Blackout or Darts round.\n-Blackout/Darts: Fixed a minor bug where the aim line and reset button could potentially be visible during a shot.\n-Chip \u0026 Putt: Fixed the shot counter from being increased by an additional point if a Putting Mode was triggered (such as Gimme or Autoscore).\n-Darts: Resolved rounds sometimes not ending after the timer runs out.\n-Darts: Fixed being able to take more shots than the number of given attempts permitted.","releaseDate":"2019-01-21"},{"versionDisplay":"1.0.3","releaseNotes":"ADDITIONS\n-Added a button to download all courses in the Course List.
