        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been a zwift user for years and particularly the racing part. Great to prepare for actual racing on the road. The app is of course fantastic but there’s still annoying glitches that aren’t getting fixed such as for example knowing if there’s a climb coming or not (i think it’s called elevation map which isn’t well designed in zwift racing). the time gaps seem to be all over the place. If you’re sitting In the middle of the pack, there’s no way to know how far the breakaway is, you have to get in front of the pack to be able to see the info. Instant power also isn’t very useful, we should be able to edit it (3sec power, 5min etc). At the moment, in pretty much every race, there’s at least one person that is « cheating » or most likely has a miss calibrated powermeter and ruins the race. The algorythm to detect these people and remove them from the race isn’t up to par. One thing i would like to see is the introduction of wind in the racing it plays a big part in normal racing. Why not in zwift?</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I had been using Rouvy or TrainerRoad with my Smart Trainer, but thought I’d give Zwift a try since our daughter and son in law are now using it. I’m not a big fan of the Virtual World, but was willing to give it a go.<br /> I should first point out that the firmware was up to date on my Hammer H3 and I ALWAYS run a calibration before riding any routes as part of my warmup routine. <br />Right off I noticed absolutely NO synchronization between negative and positive grade changes. It was actually HARDER to pedal DOWNHILL than up hill. I have NEVER had such a blatant  issue with either Rouvy or TrainerRoad. <br />50% of the time Zwift simply stopped in the middle of a ride leaving me scrambling to keep my workout going. Seems it lost contact with the trainer and my HR monitor, something that has never happened with the other Apps. Another peeve is Zwift only shows the grade changes in graph form as you progress, not of what’s ahead whereas Rouvy and TrainerRoad display the grade/resistance profile of the entire route so you can more accurately pace yourself. Unlike Rouvy, where you can ride REAL roads from all over the world, I found the choice of routes limited and repetitive. I also found simply TOO much going on visually with Zwift for my taste. <br />If you are looking for a App that functions properly and gives you the impression you’re riding outside on a road forget Zwift, go with Rouvy instead!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>As far as when Zwift works, I would always give it a 5 star rating. However, getting zwift to work is always such a struggle. I have refrained from complaining for a long time, but I can’t hold back anymore as it is hard for me to be able to use the app every single time I try. The calibration freezes on the spin down, and sometimes I have to restart the app up to 10 times before it will complete to 0 MPH to complete (it usually freezes and stops at either 2 or 4 MPH, and will not complete) . Also, after the new update when I FINALLY did complete the spin down, I got on the map (Watopia) and started pedaling. When I started pedaling, all the sudden I was going 35 MPH, and it said my power output was 490 WATTS. I was barely spinning at a warmup pace, and no matter how many times I restarted/recalibrated it wouldn’t fix the power output error. Zwift has been such an amazing training tool, but it still feels like it’s in a test phase as far as development. Maybe instead of keeping on trying to give us new maps (we all want 24/7 watopia) try fixing all of the bugs the app has. <br />Regardless of the issues I still LOVE the app and the program! I just want to be able to hop on and spin with ease!</p>

We create virtual experiences, structured workouts, and group events so that you can reach your training goals and interact with other people who use Zwift. This means that Zwift is a social platform, and that your profile information and information about your rides, runs, races, and other workouts is shared with other users and, with your permission, shared with companies that allow users to connect with each other on other platforms.\u2028\n\nThe privacy of our users is important to us and we have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect, use, and share information we obtain through your use of the websites, applications, virtual cycling and other workout games, including, the Zwift App, the Zwift Companion App and Zwift Power, and other services (“Services”) that are operated or controlled by Zwift, Inc. (collectively, “we,” “us” or “our”).\n\nChildren can also use our Services. If you, as a parent or guardian, would like to set up a Zwift account for your child, please first review our direct notice to parents. Our separate Zwift Children’s Privacy Policy explains the limited ways in which we will use and share your child’s data, as well as the rights you have with respect to that data.\n\nWe may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.\n \n1. Collection of Information\n* Information You Provide to Us\n\nTo work out with Zwift, you’ll need to create an account. To create an account, we ask you to provide your first and last name, your email address, your country, and information about you such as your date of birth, gender, height, and weight, so that we can accurately calculate information about your workout. We also collect any information you provide to customize your profile, such as what type of sport you perform (i.e. running, cycling or triathlon), what event you are training towards (i.e. sprint/ Olympic, half distance, full distance or no such event planned), and a profile picture or avatar, (collectively “Account Registration Information”). Your profile information, including your name, country, gender, age, height, and weight, is public, so you should use caution in deciding what name to use.\u2028\n\nIf you subscribe to the Services or make a purchase, we collect your payment method and your home address (“Payment Information”). We collect any other information you provide to us, such as information you provide when you sign up for an event, fill out a form, participate in a survey or contest, apply for a job, communicate with us via third-party social media sites, or request customer support.\n\nFinally, we also collect any communications you have with us or with other members of the community using the Services including via our forums (“Chat Data”).\u2028\n\n* Information About Your Workouts\nWhen you work out with Zwift, we collect information about that workout, such as your route, your cadence, your power, how long you rode or ran, your total output and total calories burned, elevation gain, and, if you are using a heart rate monitor, your heart rate.

We create virtual experiences, structured workouts, and group events so that you can reach your training goals and interact with other people who use Zwift. This means that Zwift is a social platform, and that your profile information and information about your rides, runs, races, and other workouts is shared with other users and, with your permission, shared with companies that allow users to connect with each other on other platforms.\u2028\n\nThe privacy of our users is important to us and we have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect, use, and share information we obtain through your use of the websites, applications, virtual cycling and other workout games, including, the Zwift App, the Zwift Companion App and Zwift Power, and other services (“Services”) that are operated or controlled by Zwift, Inc. (collectively, “we,” “us” or “our”).\n\nChildren can also use our Services. If you, as a parent or guardian, would like to set up a Zwift account for your child, please first review our direct notice to parents. Our separate Zwift Children’s Privacy Policy explains the limited ways in which we will use and share your child’s data, as well as the rights you have with respect to that data.\n\nWe may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.\n \n1. Collection of Information\n* Information You Provide to Us\n\nTo work out with Zwift, you’ll need to create an account. To create an account, we ask you to provide your first and last name, your email address, your country, and information about you such as your date of birth, gender, height, and weight, so that we can accurately calculate information about your workout. We also collect any information you provide to customize your profile, such as what type of sport you perform (i.e. running, cycling or triathlon), what event you are training towards (i.e. sprint/ Olympic, half distance, full distance or no such event planned), and a profile picture or avatar, (collectively “Account Registration Information”). Your profile information, including your name, country, gender, age, height, and weight, is public, so you should use caution in deciding what name to use.\u2028\n\nIf you subscribe to the Services or make a purchase, we collect your payment method and your home address (“Payment Information”). We collect any other information you provide to us, such as information you provide when you sign up for an event, fill out a form, participate in a survey or contest, apply for a job, communicate with us via third-party social media sites, or request customer support.\n\nFinally, we also collect any communications you have with us or with other members of the community using the Services including via our forums (“Chat Data”).\u2028\n\n* Information About Your Workouts\nWhen you work out with Zwift, we collect information about that workout, such as your route, your cadence, your power, how long you rode or ran, your total output and total calories burned, elevation gain, and, if you are using a heart rate monitor, your heart rate. We also collect information about any screenshots you take, challenges and missions completed and your experience level (e.g., Academy status), and fitness test results.\u2028\n\nIf you use Zwift Power, we also collect race results and performance information, such as race and segment times, personal bests, rankings, riding, and in-game data, including information on past performance from Zwift, Strava, and other relevant sports performance services. Zwift Power compiles and publishes your results from Zwift events on Zwiftpower.com. This information will be available to anyone on the internet, including members and non-members of our Services, and may appear in search engine results.\n\nIn the Services, you can chat with other users, give them a “Ride On” (like a “thumbs up”), find and follow other users., and organize virtual meet-ups.\u2028 Whatever you do, we collect and store information about that activity (collectively, “Workout Information”).\u2028\n\n* Automatically Collected Information\nWhen you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about you, including:\u2028\n\n* Log Information:  We collect log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, app version, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.\u2028\n\n* Device Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.\u2028\n\n* Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: Zwift and its partners may use cookies, clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), and other tracking technologies to collect information about you and your interaction with our Services (“Cookie Data”).

Great to prepare for actual racing on the road. The app is of course fantastic but there’s still annoying glitches that aren’t getting fixed such as for example knowing if there’s a climb coming or not (i think it’s called elevation map which isn’t well designed in zwift racing). the time gaps seem to be all over the place. If you’re sitting In the middle of the pack, there’s no way to know how far the breakaway is, you have to get in front of the pack to be able to see the info. Instant power also isn’t very useful, we should be able to edit it (3sec power, 5min etc). At the moment, in pretty much every race, there’s at least one person that is « cheating » or most likely has a miss calibrated powermeter and ruins the race. The algorythm to detect these people and remove them from the race isn’t up to par. One thing i would like to see is the introduction of wind in the racing it plays a big part in normal racing.

I’m not a big fan of the Virtual World, but was willing to give it a go.\n I should first point out that the firmware was up to date on my Hammer H3 and I ALWAYS run a calibration before riding any routes as part of my warmup routine. \nRight off I noticed absolutely NO synchronization between negative and positive grade changes. It was actually HARDER to pedal DOWNHILL than up hill. I have NEVER had such a blatant  issue with either Rouvy or TrainerRoad. \n50% of the time Zwift simply stopped in the middle of a ride leaving me scrambling to keep my workout going. Seems it lost contact with the trainer and my HR monitor, something that has never happened with the other Apps. Another peeve is Zwift only shows the grade changes in graph form as you progress, not of what’s ahead whereas Rouvy and TrainerRoad display the grade/resistance profile of the entire route so you can more accurately pace yourself. Unlike Rouvy, where you can ride REAL roads from all over the world, I found the choice of routes limited and repetitive. I also found simply TOO much going on visually with Zwift for my taste. \nIf you are looking for a App that functions properly and gives you the impression you’re riding outside on a road forget Zwift, go with Rouvy instead!","title":"Dropped out nearly every time I used it!","userName":"N1Sp"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3665639216","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-01-18T17:13:59Z","rating":3,"review":"As far as when Zwift works, I would always give it a 5 star rating. However, getting zwift to work is always such a struggle. I have refrained from complaining for a long time, but I can’t hold back anymore as it is hard for me to be able to use the app every single time I try. The calibration freezes on the spin down, and sometimes I have to restart the app up to 10 times before it will complete to 0 MPH to complete (it usually freezes and stops at either 2 or 4 MPH, and will not complete) . Also, after the new update when I FINALLY did complete the spin down, I got on the map (Watopia) and started pedaling. When I started pedaling, all the sudden I was going 35 MPH, and it said my power output was 490 WATTS. I was barely spinning at a warmup pace, and no matter how many times I restarted/recalibrated it wouldn’t fix the power output error. Zwift has been such an amazing training tool, but it still feels like it’s in a test phase as far as development. Maybe instead of keeping on trying to give us new maps (we all want 24/7 watopia) try fixing all of the bugs the app has. \nRegardless of the issues I still LOVE the app and the program!

Finally a workout video game; what a concept. But then after my trial period ended and I became a paid subscriber, I found that some of the features and functions began to wean. It first started when I was riding a race and got a message that I was riding at “superhuman” and “professional” speeds before wiping my results from the leaderboards. I was super annoyed with the first couple, but became enraged with the third and fourth after I recalibrated my equipment. Then came the running problems. First of all, Zwift should not advertise itself as a “running” app, because it has very little that runners can do compared to the cycling events. Aside from that, it quit syncing up with my Garmin Forerunner 945 all of a sudden.  Even after several “uninstalls” and reinstalls of both Zwift and resetting my Garmin, it does not sync up still. So the app is completely useless when that happens. \n\nI am so disappointed, because I thought I found an app that would keep me working out basically for the rest of my days. However, I have canceled my membership and hope that another developer will come up with something that far exceeds that of Zwift. \n\nGoodbye, Zwift!","title":"NOT a true running app. Great cycling app!","userName":"Sorry, Zwift."},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7414145380","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-06-01T14:44:27Z","rating":5,"review":"I started on Zwift about two years ago as a cyclist. I bought a trainer specially having never tried the app which was a risky investment but was a great choice. I liove cycling on Zwift. I don’t feel safe on the road and I go further knowing only have top hop off the bike and I’m home. \n\nI had to give up cycling for the minute due to herniated disks (hoping to be back on the bike soon) so I bought a treadmill and started running with Zwift. I love it! I’ve never really enjoyed running before but the Zwift environment makes it enjoyable- i ran 65 miles this month! Training plans are good. \n\nI have no issues with app stability (using IPad). When you start it is hard to understand how it all fits together / there is the Zwift app (where you do the activity) but also the companion app where you organize everything - took me a while to make sense of that- but once you get going it’s excellent.","title":"Love this app - it’s fun and easy to use","userName":"bec12343213"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7483965938","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-06-20T00:12:28Z","rating":2,"review":"I love Zwift. But the Zwift app on iOS, not so much. I’m sure it’s wonderful on an iPad, but on and iPhone it’s too small a screen to be useful. I  use it to check my route/badge status when planning my next ride, because the only way to see completed routes, as of June 2021, is in Zwift itself. (Not in Zwift Companion as one would hope).  The danger of using this app in that manner is that, if you accidentally stay logged into Zwift here, then go ride in Zwift on your PC, MacBook, Apple TV or whatever, is that your Drops and Route Badges may not post to your account. This has happened to me on more than one occasion. Zwift Support says it’s my fault for not logging out of one device before starting a session on another device, and they are right. Except that there is no way to actually log out on iOS Zwift; you must kill the app by swiping up, specifically. For this, and because Zwift on a mobile device isn’t a great experience anyway, I am giving the app one star because it allows you to corrupt your data, when Zwift is very aware that there is an issue.","title":"Caution: there is no logout on this app and it will mess up your drips and badges","userName":"TimSWMo"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7414847286","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-06-01T18:32:15Z","rating":5,"review":"I have read a lot of the reviews and I honestly have not had any of the connection problems.

I use a Wahoo Kickr core trainer and a Wahoo armband HR monitor and I have never had connection issues. I love this app so much so that I get accused of having agoraphobia!\n\nMy son, the gamer, feels the graphics are rudimentary compared to his video games so perhaps that is an issue that can be addressed. Also, there are times that my avatar will literally ride right thru someone which is unsettling and obviously not realistic.\n\nOverall, this app has changed the way I ride.

I sent a message to customer service and never got a reply. I wanted to like this app and bought wahoo sensors for my spin bike so I can watch but even though my wahoo app instantly recognizes the sensors, the wahoo and companion app almost never does and when it does easily disconnects. I was only able to get it to work 2-3 times in the entire week of the free trial. I spent 40-50 min trying to connect it every time I tried to ride, which is longer than a workout would have been. Very disappointed both in the app and the service. It’s extremely clumsy using this and now I’ve paid $15 for an app that doesn’t work- trying to “wake up” the sensors doesn’t work and there should be a way to control the main app while sitting on your bike by using the companion app. Seems like this works well for people with smart trainers but people relying on separate speed and cadence sensors will probably not be able to use it consistently enough.","title":"Got charged for free trial a day early","userName":"K_Stritz"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7607329587","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-07-23T02:39:47Z","rating":1,"review":"Version 4.6 has a number of known bugs that are list in the support section on Zwifts website (you have to search a little “Game Update Known Issues - July 19”). They look pretty severe (activities not saving, log in not possible etc.) and each section has a headline “Workaround” where the following paragraph reads “While there’s currently no workaround….” - it’s almost comical because it’s the same for all bugs. Why even having a “Workaround” section? \n\nThe one that is effecting me is that it won’t allow pairing a smart trainer and a separate power meter at the same time anymore. Might be an edge case for many but my situation is that I’m running smart rollers whose power meter is wildly inaccurate and therefore the bug renders my setup basically useless.\n\nTook me a while to figure this out (running on my phone) and then I grabbed my iPad which has auto update turned off.
