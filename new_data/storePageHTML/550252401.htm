        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The PAC-12 app is great it’s allowed me to follow some of the sports that don’t often make the cut on TV like women’s volleyball that may be being streamed but not on the broadcast. <br />The only problem is my cable provider recently got rid of pac-12 so now as the fall season comes around I’m scrambling probably going to get Sling but  though they are a pac-12 provider they don’t have access to live TV? I don’t know why but why isn’t there a pay to view access like HBO Now for people who don’t have access to the cable providers listed. It would be so much better. <br />Love the app but access is limited based on where you live and cable providers available. There should be a pay option</p>

I’ve also looked online and I’ve taken the steps instructed and still it saying it has a streaming error, I’ve even updated the app. Why is it so difficult with the PAC 12 app when you are supposed to be a leading brand and also located pretty much in Silicon Valley and yet me and my friends continue to get this problem? Please help ASAP or else I’ll make a complaint.<br /><br />Device: iPad<br />App version: 2.33<br />Operating System: 12.1.1</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The application freezes constantly. I have my cable information already saved in my phone and in the app and it says it fails to confirm my information and suggests restarting the app. I press the song in button and nothing happens. I press the key in the top right and nothing happens. I go to settings and select the button that says “tv provider” and nothing happens. This app is severely broken. We pay ridiculously high cable prices to these thief’s and they can’t even use that money to making a working app. They should be ashamed of themselves. Everyone using this app deserves a refund for their cable subscription. They are not providing the service they promised and the service we pay for.</p>

What About Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?\nWhen you interact with the Sites and Applications, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. We\nor our third party service providers use cookies, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and similar\ntechnologies to track user activity and collect website and application data. We may combine this data with the\npersonal information we have collected from you. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-nottrack” requests. . You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling\ncookies), but such disabling will impair use of the Sites and Applications.\nCookies. Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. We\nand our third party service providers may use “cookies” on our Sites and Applications to, among other things,\nbetter serve you with tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Sites and\nApplications. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent cookies. In addition, we also allow \nvendors to use cookies on our Sites and Applications.\n- Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your\ncomputer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our\nsystems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged in to the Sites and Applications.\nThis allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have\nlogged in, as you move through our Sites and Applications.\n- Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser\nor turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information\nabout user activity, which may be combined with other user information.\n- Third Party Cookies. We may also engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally and\npersonally identifiable website data and to serve advertisements. To do so, we may permit third parties to\napply cookies to users of our Sites and Applications, where permitted by law, and, subject to your right to\nopt-out through the Network Advertising Initiative and About Ads (as discussed below). We use the data\ncollected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Sites and Applications\nand to analyze site usage. Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with\nother information that they have collected. These third parties are required to use your information in\naccordance with this Policy.\nDisabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your\nbrowser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to\nprevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a\nnew cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Sites and Applications who disable their web\nbrowsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Sites and Applications; however, many site\nfeatures, such as the shopping cart, will not function if you disable cookies. For more information on our\ncookies and opt-out features, please see our Cookies Statement.\nLocal Storage Objects. We and our third party service providers may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash\nLSOs”) in order to store your Site preferences, to personalize your visit or to display content based upon what\nyou view on our Site. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data\nstored. In addition, you cannot control, delete or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your browser.\nFor more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash cookies, go to the\nAdobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions. To see\nthe Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the\ninstructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.\nWeb Beacons, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies. We may use web beacons, such as clear GIFs, web\nbugs or pixel tags, which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier similar in function to cookies. In contrast to\ncookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages.\nWe may use clear GIFs in connection with our Sites and Applications to, among other things, track the\nactivities of website visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about website usage. We and\nour third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, identify when our e-mails are viewed\nand track whether our e-mails are forwarded. For more information on the types of such tracking\ntechnologies we use, please see our Cookies Statement.\nSite Analytics. We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of\nour Sites and Applications. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Sites and Applications. We\nuse these tools to help us improve our Sites and Applications, performance and user experiences. These\nentities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. We do not share your\npersonal information with these third parties. For the privacy policies and mechanisms for opting out of\nGoogle Analytics, please see https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.\nThird-Party Ad Networks. We may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on\nour Sites and Applications. Please see the section entitled “Advertisements” for additional information about\nour practices and your choices with regard to receiving such advertisements.\nAdvertisements\nWe display advertisements on our Sites and Applications. Some of the advertisements are based on the\ncollection of personal information and others are based on the collection of aggregate information. Please see\nthe bottom of this section for opt-out information.\nWe use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Sites and Applications.\nNetwork advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Sites and\nApplications and other websites and applications you have visited. This enables us and these third parties to\ntarget advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad\nnetwork providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript,\nweb beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their\nads and to personalize advertising content to you.\nThese third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy,\nnot this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Sites and\nApplications and our Services, both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information.\nYou may opt-out of many third-party ad networks. The website\nhttp://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp provides information regarding this practice by\nNetwork Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information\nused by these companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by NAI\nmembers. You also may contact About Ads at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ for information about opting\nout of targeted advertising and your choices regarding having information used by About Ads member\ncompanies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by About Ads members. Opting out\nof one or more NAI members or About Ad members (many of which will be the same) only means that those\nmembers no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive\nany targeted content or ads on our Sites and Applications or other websites and applications. You may\ncontinue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if\nyour browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt- out page, or you subsequently erase\nyour cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or About Ad opt-out may no longer,\nbe effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and About Ad’s websites and applications accessible\nby the above links.\n6.

From time to time, we review our\nsecurity procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that,\ndespite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.\n8.

We are not responsible for\nthe information practices of these Pac-12 member institutions websites. In addition, certain of the content\nstreaming services offered through our Sites and Applications require you to register with your third-party cable or\nsatellite provider. Any information you provide to register for such services is subject to the privacy policies of \nsuch third-party providers; we are not responsible for their information practices.\n10.
