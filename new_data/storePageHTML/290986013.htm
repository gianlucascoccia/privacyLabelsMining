Whether it's the latest gadget you've preordered online, or a new graphic novel you can't wait to dive into, Deliveries will keep tabs on it so you don't miss the doorbell.\n\nThe main list shows a summary of all your shipments and counts down the days. Select a delivery for more information, and see where it is on a map. If you like you can view the shipping company’s web page, or easily share your shipment over email, iMessage, or AirDrop. Deliveries can even add estimated delivery dates to your calendar, and a Notification Center widget lets you quickly check your packages without opening the app. All your old deliveries are archived so you can look them up again if you need to. An Apple Watch app is also included so you can see the latest updates with just a glance.\n\nDeliveries supports dozens of services, including UPS, FedEx, US Postal Service, DHL, TNT, Canada Post, and many more. You can also track orders from services like Amazon and Apple, even before they ship. (Some services are limited to specific countries—visit junecloud.com/services for details.) If you have packages from other services, just select “Other” and enter a delivery date and web site—so you can check on them when you need to and still keep everything in one place.\n\nDeliveries is also available for Mac. You can sync your deliveries between devices with iCloud or our own Junecloud sync. If you create a Junecloud account, you can add new shipments from any web browser.\n\nHave any questions?

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Deliveries helps you keep track of all your packages, so you always know when they’re going to arrive. Whether it&#39;s the latest gadget you&#39;ve preordered online, or a new graphic novel you can&#39;t wait to dive into, Deliveries will keep tabs on it so you don&#39;t miss the doorbell.<br /><br />The main list shows a summary of all your shipments and counts down the days. Select a delivery for more information, and see where it is on a map. If you like you can view the shipping company’s web page, or easily share your shipment over email, iMessage, or AirDrop. Deliveries can even add estimated delivery dates to your calendar, and a Notification Center widget lets you quickly check your packages without opening the app. All your old deliveries are archived so you can look them up again if you need to. An Apple Watch app is also included so you can see the latest updates with just a glance.<br /><br />Deliveries supports dozens of services, including UPS, FedEx, US Postal Service, DHL, TNT, Canada Post, and many more. You can also track orders from services like Amazon and Apple, even before they ship. (Some services are limited to specific countries—visit junecloud.com/services for details.) If you have packages from other services, just select “Other” and enter a delivery date and web site—so you can check on them when you need to and still keep everything in one place.<br /><br />Deliveries is also available for Mac. You can sync your deliveries between devices with iCloud or our own Junecloud sync. If you create a Junecloud account, you can add new shipments from any web browser.<br /><br />Have any questions?

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This update fixes some common issues with our previous update, which included many other improvements. For full details, visit juncld.com/e3Cd<br /><br />• Fixed an issue where the app might get stuck “updating” if it was unable to upgrade the database from an older version. In most cases the app is now able to upgrade the database. If it is still unable to, the problem is now handled automatically, and a new, empty database is created.<br />• Improved the upgrade process to minimize freezes or crashes when handling a large database.<br />• Fixed a crash that could happen if Handoff was used before the app had a chance to upgrade its database.<br />• Fixed an issue that prevented suggestions from showing on the Add Delivery screen.<br />• Fixed an issue where the app might needlessly download an older service update than the one included with the app.<br />• Fixed an issue where parts of the app’s update process (like refreshing deliveries or syncing) might not work if the startup process was interrupted. This situation is now handled automatically.</p>

Deliveries can track shipments from most carriers—including Amazon— and pinpoint your package on a map along the way. You’ll get notifications, but double-checking its progress is fast thanks to the handy widget. Disclaimer: Glancing at this app dozens of times a day won’t make your stuff arrive more quickly.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’m a busy guy, what can I say.  Most of the time when I receive packages, whether they’re from work or personal, I have no idea what’s in them.  I also frequently have to send things to others and need to be able to confirm that they receive them.  This handy little app does all of this and is beautifully designed as well.  Within the app, it shows me where the package is and provides me with a link to the carrier’s website so I can view all of the specifics.  It’s one of those apps I didn’t know I needed, but now would prefer not to live without.  Keeping all of this information in one place has saved me a lot of time searching through emails and receipts.  Now I just copy the number (the app even detects this) and add it to my list.  The greatest feature for me is being able to name my shipments.  I also like the archive feature so that I can pull up past shipments without having them clutter the screen and distract from those items that are en route.<br /><br />Suggestions for Improvements:<br />-make a web version available<br />-enable your users to be able to enter or attach files so that they can list the contents shipped</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Attn upset users: Free replacement is Shop Tracking app.  <br /><br />I’m with the others who paid for this and it’s now going subscription based.  I can understand a subscription to pay for sync on your servers since that costs you money and thus costs the user money, but to sync to iCloud costs you nothing yet you force your cloud on the user.  You can argue we’re paying for continued development, but again you’re doing this all wrong.  I paid for this app as well as any bug fixes that go with it and we both know it doesn’t cost you any money each month for me to check UPS or any other service just as I would with my laptop at their site.  I already paid UPS/FedEx/etc for access to tracking, why are you trying to be a bouncer and take a cut? <br /><br />Want to have your users pay you for work/time?  Take a hint from Microsoft or any other developer that follows proper upgrade cycles.  Release version 2 with sufficient features as a new app we can choose to pay for.  If it’s not worth it to us, we skip it and wait for version 3 to see if that’s worth it for us.  It’s a fair market that way, as we decide if your cost on is aligns with the value vs you forcing us to pay you when you may not be working at all.  You can fool the idiots but I’m not one of them.  Stop being greedy, we have other options that are equally as good if not better (like Shop).  Good luck with your new rating going forward, your app is no longer carries value.</p>

update fixes some common issues with our previous update, which included many other improvements. For full details, visit juncld.com/e3Cd\n\n• Fixed an issue where the app might get stuck “updating” if it was unable to upgrade the database from an older version. In most cases the app is now able to upgrade the database. If it is still unable to, the problem is now handled automatically, and a new, empty database is created.\n• Improved the upgrade process to minimize freezes or crashes when handling a large database.\n• Fixed a crash that could happen if Handoff was used before the app had a chance to upgrade its database.\n• Fixed an issue that prevented suggestions from showing on the Add Delivery screen.\n• Fixed an issue where the app might needlessly download an older service update than the one included with the app.\n• Fixed an issue where parts of the app’s update process (like refreshing deliveries or syncing) might not work if the startup process was interrupted. This situation is now handled automatically.","releaseDate":"2021-09-23"},{"versionDisplay":"9.2","releaseNotes":"This is a significant update, though many of the improvements are behind the scenes. There are a large number of improvements to reliability and performance, and many smaller changes to make Deliveries easier to use.\n\n• Sharing a delivery now includes a link to deliveries.app that makes it easy for the recipient to add the item to Deliveries or view the tracking page online. If you use a “copy” action you’ll get the same info as before, with a link directly to the carrier’s tracking page.\n• The menu of Share options have been improved, and a “More…” item at the bottom makes them easier to manage.\n• Notifications can now be expanded on macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later. Click the arrow in the top-right corner of a notification to see a map and the latest details.\n• DHL shipments are now updated through deliveries.app for improved reliability and efficiency. For more about this change, visit juncld.com/e3FC\n• “DHL Express” is now labeled “DHL”, and supports most DHL shipments. “DHL GlobalMail” is now labeled “DHL eCommerce”.\n• Improved suggestions when adding a new delivery.\n• Improved how the Add Delivery screen shows deliveries detected on the clipboard. This simplifies the number of options available at once and allows you to dismiss the clipboard suggestions if that’s not what you wanted.\n• If there are multiple tracking numbers on the clipboard, Deliveries can detect all of them.\n• Improved how items with multiple packages refresh. For example if you have an order with one package that was already delivered, that shipment is no longer refreshed along with the others.\n• Maps for deliveries with multiple packages now emphasize the selected package. Maps in notifications focus on the route that’s relevant to the notification.\n• Map views are more efficient, and better at handling errors looking up locations. They’re less likely to animate unexpectedly while you’re adjusting the view, and they look a bit nicer too.\n• Creating a placeholder with the current date no longer automatically marks it as delivered. You can use the “Mark Delivered” button afterward if necessary.\n• Improved how parts of the app communicate with each other, for more immediate updates.\n• Improved syncing reliability.\n• Improvements for signing in to third-party services.\n• Item name suggestions are now ordered by when they were last used.\n• Fixed an issue where choosing an “edit an existing delivery” option on the Add Delivery screen might leave that item archived after saving. Now this will always show a “Restore” button. You can still edit the name of an existing delivery without restoring it if you use the search field to find it, open the “…” menu, and choose “Edit”.\n• Improved how the subscription view shows previous purchases.\n• Improved tracking number detection for Chronopost, DHL, La Poste, and UPS.\n• Improved link detection for DHL, USPS, and Swiss Post.\n• Improved importing from UPS.\n• Improved the appearance of the widget in situations with limited information.\n• Calendar events include the tracking number and link, and titles are limited to 64 characters.\n• The “Close” menu item has been moved to the “File” menu, where it is more commonly found.\n• The “Deliveries Session Data” in the keychain is no longer used.\n• Deliveries will now ignore clipboard contents from certain apps like 1Password, based on the content type set by the app.\n• Fixed a bug where the Add to Deliveries extension did not always detect links.\n• Fixed a bug where the Share menu in other apps did not always include Add to Deliveries when it should.\n• Fixed a bug where there was a noticeable delay when using any keyboard shortcut in Deliveries, or when opening the Share menu.\n• Fixed an unexpected error if you used certain characters in the Item Name field, like the chef emoji.\n• Localization improvements.\n• Fixed many different causes of crashes, and other reliability improvements.","releaseDate":"2021-09-13"},{"versionDisplay":"9.1.2","releaseNotes":"• Fixed an issue where those who previously purchased Deliveries may have been asked to subscribe when trying to add a new delivery.\n• Improved subscription verification.\n• If you’re using Junecloud sync and your subscription expires, the subscription screen may appear when you launch the app. If you turn off Junecloud sync this will no longer appear.\n• Adjusted how often some deliveries refresh. This mainly affects deliveries that haven’t changed in a while. For example if a delivery doesn’t have a date and hasn’t changed in over a week, it will update less often.\n• Improved handling of errors when updating deliveries.\n• Improved tracking number validation for UPS and USPS.\n• Improved tracking number detection for La Poste.\n• Improved link detection for amazon.com, ups.com, usps.com, sagawa-exp.co.jp, and others.\n• Improved handling of iCloud errors.\n• Fixed some minor issues in the German localization.","releaseDate":"2021-02-23"},{"versionDisplay":"9.1.1","releaseNotes":"• Improved widget refreshing: it's more efficient and more reliable.\n• Fixed an issue that caused the widget to unintentionally sync with Junecloud at midnight.\n• Fixed an issue where the app might get stuck due to an iCloud problem.\n• Fixed an issue where purchases were not always recognized.\n• Updated support for DHL Germany.\n• Improved tracking number validation for Poste Italiane.\n• Updated icons in the empty view and the subscription view.\n• Improved the appearance of the empty view in both the main app and Deliveries Express.\n• Some other minor bug fixes.","releaseDate":"2020-12-19"},{"versionDisplay":"9.1","releaseNotes":"• New widgets for macOS Big Sur.\n• Updated appearance for macOS Big Sur.\n• Updated for Apple Silicon Macs.\n• Improved tracking number validation for USPS and Chronopost.\n• Fixed an issue where “Import from a web site” did not always detect deliveries on the page.\n• Fixed an issue where “Import from a web site” showed the results in the wrong order. Now deliveries at the top of the page should appear first.\n• Improved importing from UPS.\n• Fixed an issue where opening the app could result in the background app updating at the same time, causing some odd behavior like blank deliveries.\n• Improved date detection for Apple orders.\n• Improved date detection for Amazon when the language is not set to the default.\n• Fixed unexpected errors checking Hermes and Posten shipments that do not have any information available.\n• Fixed an issue where some Hermes shipments would continue to show the estimated delivery date instead of the actual delivered date.\n• Fixed an issue where “restore purchases” did not always work as expected.\n• Fixed a bug where a previous purchase was not always recoginized, or a complimentary subscription would show an incorrect date.\n• Placeholders no longer count toward the maximum number of deliveries.\n• A few other minor bug fixes.","releaseDate":"2020-11-25"},{"versionDisplay":"9.0.2","releaseNotes":"• Fixed an issue where iCloud sync did not work correctly for some people, particularly those who recently used the app for the first time.\n• Fixed an issue where some UPS tracking numbers could not be added, with an incorrect message that the number was not valid.\n• The “Restore Purchases” button is now shown on the Subscription screen if you have a complimentary subscription. This will refresh the expiration date if the incorrect date is shown.","releaseDate":"2020-10-13"},{"versionDisplay":"9.0.1","releaseNotes":"• A fresh look: We've touched up every detail to make it easier to keep track of your shipments.\n• Subscriptions: Try Deliveries for a month to see if it works for you, or subscribe yearly for a significant discount. One subscription gives you access to Deliveries on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. If you previously purchased the app, you'll still get most features for no extra charge. Learn more at juncld.com/subs\n• Tracking history: For most services, the full history is shown in the app, and it's archived with the delivery if you ever need to look it up.\n• Easier to add deliveries: It's faster to add new shipments, with improved suggestions, and an \"import\" option to add multiple shipments from popular sites.\n• Drag and drop: Drop emails, links, or text onto the app to add shipments. You can also drag deliveries to other apps, like Mail or Safari.\n• Multiple selection: Hold shift or command on your keyboard and click to select multiple items, then archive or share several items at once. You can also use Select All in the Edit menu. If you accidentally delete something, choose Undo.\n• Sync: Both iCloud and Junecloud are faster and more reliable. You can also use both, for the benefits of iCloud without missing out on Junecloud features like \"Mail to Deliveries\" and web access.\n• Export: save a complete backup of your active and archived items. Open the File menu, then Export, then choose \"All Deliveries\". You'll get a single file with everything, so it's easy to share or re-import later.\n• Placeholders: Previously labeled \"Other\", placeholders now include buttons to quickly edit them or mark them as delivered.\n• Dates: the year is now shown for dates further away. On the details screen, click on a countdown like \"delivered in 5 days\" to see the actual date.\n• Item name suggestions: Type a few letters and Deliveries will suggest previous item names.\n• Help with mistakes: As you enter information, small mistakes like extra spaces are cleaned up automatically. If you try to save a delivery with an invalid tracking number, the app will let you know, so you can fix the typo or choose a different service.\n• Archived items: They're no longer dimmed out, so they're easier to read. You can also edit item names without restoring.\n• Source details: Deliveries added through email or Safari now include information about where they came from. Click to open the email or web page.\n• Sorting: Your manual sort order now syncs with iCloud.\n• Internet Access Policy: Apps like Little Snitch can now explain what each connection is used for.\n• You didn't miss versions 4 through 8—we bumped up the number to match Deliveries 9 for iOS. This should make it easier to tell which versions match up.\n• On macOS Catalina or later, passwords and session data are saved so all parts of the app can access them. If you occasionally see prompts for keychain access, you'll see fewer requests over time, and eventually you won't see them at all.\n• Many other improvements to performance and reliability.\n• 9.0.1 fixes a bug where purchased subscriptions were not always recognized by the app.\n• Note: macOS 10.14 or later is required.","releaseDate":"2020-10-01"},{"versionDisplay":"9.0","releaseNotes":null,"releaseDate":"2020-09-30"}],"hasPrivacyPolicyText":false,"supportedLocales":[{"name":"English","tag":"en-US"},{"name":"French","tag":"fr-FR"},{"name":"German","tag":"de-DE"},{"name":"Japanese","tag":"ja"}],"customAttributes":{"default":{"default":{"customScreenshotsByType":{"mac":[{"width":2880,"height":1800,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/be/ee/e3/beeee32a-af36-bde4-accc-441296be3d35/955faa18-303b-4919-b348-2cae381a0b9e_deliveries-mac-1.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"171e25","textColor1":"f5f7f7","textColor2":"9cd1fc","textColor3":"c8cccd","textColor4":"81add1"},{"width":2880,"height":1800,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/59/92/5b/59925b71-c625-5c21-f22e-a126aa6afd43/8dae075f-de12-44bf-8ed3-046af42620a1_deliveries-mac-3.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"171e25","textColor1":"9cd1fc","textColor2":"6fbef4","textColor3":"81add1","textColor4":"5e9ecb"},{"width":2880,"height":1800,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/ad/df/80/addf8058-75ab-69d3-a828-5c9f16cd8786/7a42f69b-f2fc-45ad-b701-aeac9df08ecd_deliveries-mac-2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"01193d","textColor1":"f3f5f7","textColor2":"2fd3fe","textColor3":"c2c9d2","textColor4":"25aed7"},{"width":2880,"height":1800,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/8f/b4/9f/8fb49fed-38b6-2b6f-f4ad-1623a28428d0/3a3f017e-2398-431a-8185-392e5fc63b2f_deliveries-mac-4.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"171e25","textColor1":"f3f4f4","textColor2":"9cd1fc","textColor3":"c7c9cb","textColor4":"81add1"},{"width":2880,"height":1800,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/ed/b4/12/edb41210-c3ee-b387-0a02-dc686d7a8244/79be5b52-f970-42c6-8cd9-08685c941b41_deliveries-mac-5.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"171e25","textColor1":"f5f7f7","textColor2":"9cd1fc","textColor3":"c8cccd","textColor4":"81add1"}]}}}},"privacyPolicyUrl":"https://junecloud.com/legal/privacy.html","supportsGameController":false,"releaseDate":"2019-01-31","editorialBadgeInfo":{"editorialBadgeType":"editorialPriority","nameForDisplay":"Editors’ Choice"},"hasSafariExtension":false,"externalVersionId":844256050,"supportURLForLanguage":"https://junecloud.com/support/deliveries-ios/","editorialArtwork":{"originalFlowcaseBrick":{"width":3200,"height":600,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features1/v4/57/44/8a/57448ab1-44c4-6216-d6e6-727945f3124d/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f2e6c5","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"472e04","textColor3":"302e27","textColor4":"69532b"},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features122/v4/4c/ef/1b/4cef1bfd-02a4-4094-e629-feb3ed733867/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"fce443","textColor1":"030f11","textColor2":"201e0e","textColor3":"353a1b","textColor4":"4c4519"},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features118/v4/47/5b/52/475b527d-0e45-3448-b834-f74e592b1699/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"f8f0cf","textColor1":"000403","textColor2":"0d0900","textColor3":"31332c","textColor4":"3c3729"},"brandLogo":{"width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features114/v4/81/06/f6/8106f65f-9dd7-d960-fc6d-102bc3939685/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor4":"b7b7b7"}},"requirementsString":"macOS 10.14 or later","subtitle":"Track your packages","isDeliveredInIOSAppForWatchOS":false,"bundleId":"com.junecloud.Deliveries","hasInAppPurchases":true,"isAppleWatchSupported":false,"isStandaloneForWatchOS":false,"supportsPassbook":false,"copyright":"© 2008–2021 Junecloud LLC","requiresGameController":false,"isHiddenFromSpringboard":false,"isGameCenterEnabled":false,"minimumOSVersion":"10.14","hasFamilyShareableInAppPurchases":true,"runsOnIntel":true,"editorialNotes":{"standard":"The sweet agony of waiting for your latest purchase to arrive never looked so good.

Deliveries can even add estimated delivery dates to your calendar, and a Notification Center widget lets you quickly check your packages without opening the app. All your old deliveries are archived so you can look them up again if you need to. An Apple Watch app is also included so you can see the latest updates with just a glance.\n\nDeliveries supports dozens of services, including UPS, FedEx, US Postal Service, DHL, TNT, Canada Post, and many more. You can also track orders from services like Amazon and Apple, even before they ship. (Some services are limited to specific countries—visit junecloud.com/services for details.) If you have packages from other services, just select “Other” and enter a delivery date and web site—so you can check on them when you need to and still keep everything in one place.\n\nDeliveries is also available for Mac. You can sync your deliveries between devices with iCloud or our own Junecloud sync. If you create a Junecloud account, you can add new shipments from any web browser.\n\nHave any questions?

For full details, visit juncld.com/e39G\n\n• Fixed an issue where the app might get stuck “updating” if it was unable to upgrade the database from an older version. In most cases the app is now able to upgrade the database. If it is still unable to, the problem is now handled automatically, and a new, empty database is created.\n• Improved the upgrade process to minimize freezes or crashes when handling a large database.\n• Fixed a crash that could happen if Handoff was used before the app had a chance to upgrade its database.\n• Fixed an issue that prevented suggestions from showing on the Add Delivery screen.\n• Fixed an issue where the app might needlessly download an older service update than the one included with the app.\n• Fixed an issue where parts of the app’s update process (like refreshing deliveries or syncing) might not work if the startup process was interrupted. This situation is now handled automatically.","releaseDate":"2021-09-23"},{"versionDisplay":"9.2","releaseNotes":"This is a significant update, though many of the improvements are behind the scenes. There are a large number of improvements to reliability and performance, and many smaller changes to make Deliveries easier to use.\n\n• Sharing a delivery now includes a link to deliveries.app that makes it easy for the recipient to add the item to Deliveries or view the tracking page online. If you use a “copy” action you’ll get the same info as before, with a link directly to the carrier’s tracking page.\n• The barcode scanner can now detect tracking numbers in text. It’s also faster and better at ignoring unwanted barcodes.\n• DHL shipments are now updated through deliveries.app for improved reliability and efficiency. For more about this change, visit juncld.com/e3FC\n• “DHL Express” is now labeled “DHL”, and supports most DHL shipments. “DHL GlobalMail” is now labeled “DHL eCommerce”.\n• Improved suggestions when adding a new delivery.\n• Improved how the Add Delivery screen shows deliveries detected on the clipboard. This simplifies the options available and allows you to dismiss the clipboard suggestions if that’s not what you wanted.\n• If there are multiple tracking numbers on the clipboard, Deliveries can detect all of them.\n• Improved how items with multiple packages refresh. For example if you have an order with one package that was already delivered, that shipment is no longer refreshed along with the others.\n• Maps for deliveries with multiple packages now emphasize the selected package. Maps in notifications focus on the route that’s relevant to the notification.\n• Map views are more efficient, and better at handling errors looking up locations. They’re less likely to animate unexpectedly while you’re adjusting the view, and they look a bit nicer too.\n• Creating a placeholder with the current date no longer automatically marks it as delivered. You can use the “Mark Delivered” button afterward if necessary.\n• Improved how parts of the app communicate with each other, for more immediate updates.\n• Improved syncing reliability.\n• Improvements for signing in to third-party services.\n• Item name suggestions are now ordered by when they were last used.\n• Fixed an issue where choosing an “edit an existing delivery” option on the Add Delivery screen might leave that item archived after saving. Now this will always show a “Restore” button. You can still edit the name of an existing delivery without restoring it if you use the search field to find it, open the “…” menu, and choose “Edit”.\n• Improved how the subscription view shows previous purchases.\n• Improved tracking number detection for Chronopost, DHL, La Poste, and UPS.\n• Improved link detection for DHL, USPS, and Swiss Post.\n• Improved importing from UPS.\n• Improved the appearance of the widget in situations with limited information.\n• Calendar events include the tracking number and link, and titles are limited to 64 characters.\n• The “open the app to resume background updates” notification will no longer appear if you don’t have any deliveries.\n• Fixed an unexpected error if you used certain characters in the Item Name field, like the chef emoji.\n• Localization improvements.\n• Fixed many different causes of crashes, and other reliability improvements.\n\nApple Watch:\n\n• The Apple Watch app has been completely rewritten, with many small improvements.\n• Improved syncing reliability.\n• If iCloud sync is enabled, and you have another device with Deliveries installed, the Apple Watch app can show notifications even when your iPhone is unavailable.\n• The largest text size setting now uses an alternate layout for improved accessibility.\n• The complication for the Extra Large watch face is improved on Apple Watch Series 4 or later. It now uses a “gauge” style that includes a circular progress meter.\n• Note: maps on Apple Watch now require watchOS 7 or later.","releaseDate":"2021-09-13"},{"versionDisplay":"9.1.2","releaseNotes":"• Fixed an issue where those who previously purchased Deliveries may have been asked to subscribe when trying to add a new delivery.\n• Improved subscription verification.\n• If you’re using Junecloud sync and your subscription expires, the subscription screen may appear when you launch the app. If you turn off Junecloud sync this will no longer appear.\n• The barcode scanner now has lines marking the center of the area, which can help with scanning longer barcodes.\n• Fixed an issue where copying a delivery included the link twice.\n• Adjusted how often some deliveries refresh. This mainly affects deliveries that haven’t changed in a while. For example if a delivery doesn’t have a date and hasn’t changed in over a week, it will update less often.\n• Improved handling of errors when updating deliveries.\n• Improved tracking number validation for UPS and USPS.\n• Improved tracking number detection for La Poste.\n• Improved link detection for amazon.com, ups.com, usps.com, sagawa-exp.co.jp, and others.\n• Improved handling of iCloud errors.\n• Fixed some minor issues in the German localization.","releaseDate":"2021-02-23"},{"versionDisplay":"9.1.1","releaseNotes":"• Faster text entry: the Add Delivery screen now uses the number keyboard by default.

Now deliveries at the top of the page should appear first.\n• Improved importing from UPS.\n• Improved syncing with Apple Watch. This fixes an issue where items might continue to show on Apple Watch after they were archived or deleted.\n• Fixed an issue with the Apple Watch complication. Previously if all of the today’s items had been delivered, the complication would count down until the next delivery. Now it will show a checkmark until the day ends, or all of the delivered items are acrhived.\n• Improved date detection for Apple orders.\n• Improved date detection for Amazon when the language is not set to the default.\n• Fixed unexpected errors checking Hermes and Posten shipments that do not have any information available.\n• Fixed an issue where some Hermes shipments would continue to show the estimated delivery date instead of the actual delivered date.\n• Fixed an issue where “restore purchases” did not always work as expected.\n• Fixed a bug where a previous purchase was not always recoginized, or a complimentary subscription would show an incorrect date.\n• Fixed a possible crash when showing the detail view.\n• Placeholders no longer count toward the maximum number of deliveries.\n• A few other minor bug fixes.","releaseDate":"2020-11-25"},{"versionDisplay":"9.0.2","releaseNotes":"• Fixed an issue where iCloud sync did not work correctly for some people, particularly those who recently used the app for the first time.\n• Fixed an issue where some UPS tracking numbers could not be added, with an incorrect message that the number was not valid.\n• The “Restore Purchases” button is now shown on the Subscription screen if you have a complimentary subscription.

Whether it's the latest gadget you've preordered online, or a new graphic novel you can't wait to dive into, Deliveries will keep tabs on it so you don't miss the doorbell.\n\nThe main list shows a summary of all your shipments and counts down the days. Select a delivery for more information, and see where it is on a map. If you like you can view the shipping company’s web page, or easily share your shipment over email, iMessage, or AirDrop. Deliveries can even add estimated delivery dates to your calendar, and a Notification Center widget lets you quickly check your packages without opening the app. All your old deliveries are archived so you can look them up again if you need to. An Apple Watch app is also included so you can see the latest updates with just a glance.\n\nDeliveries supports dozens of services, including UPS, FedEx, US Postal Service, DHL, TNT, Canada Post, and many more. You can also track orders from services like Amazon and Apple, even before they ship. (Some services are limited to specific countries—visit junecloud.com/services for details.)

Most of the time when I receive packages, whether they’re from work or personal, I have no idea what’s in them.  I also frequently have to send things to others and need to be able to confirm that they receive them.  This handy little app does all of this and is beautifully designed as well.  Within the app, it shows me where the package is and provides me with a link to the carrier’s website so I can view all of the specifics.  It’s one of those apps I didn’t know I needed, but now would prefer not to live without.  Keeping all of this information in one place has saved me a lot of time searching through emails and receipts.  Now I just copy the number (the app even detects this) and add it to my list.  The greatest feature for me is being able to name my shipments.  I also like the archive feature so that I can pull up past shipments without having them clutter the screen and distract from those items that are en route.\n\nSuggestions for Improvements:\n-make a web version available\n-enable your users to be able to enter or attach files so that they can list the contents shipped","title":"Beautiful Design \u0026 Very Useful","userName":"RockRevieww"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6507584844","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-06T18:54:49Z","rating":1,"review":"Attn upset users: Free replacement is Shop Tracking app.  \n\nI’m with the others who paid for this and it’s now going subscription based.  I can understand a subscription to pay for sync on your servers since that costs you money and thus costs the user money, but to sync to iCloud costs you nothing yet you force your cloud on the user.  You can argue we’re paying for continued development, but again you’re doing this all wrong.  I paid for this app as well as any bug fixes that go with it and we both know it doesn’t cost you any money each month for me to check UPS or any other service just as I would with my laptop at their site.  I already paid UPS/FedEx/etc for access to tracking, why are you trying to be a bouncer and take a cut? \n\nWant to have your users pay you for work/time?  Take a hint from Microsoft or any other developer that follows proper upgrade cycles.  Release version 2 with sufficient features as a new app we can choose to pay for.  If it’s not worth it to us, we skip it and wait for version 3 to see if that’s worth it for us.  It’s a fair market that way, as we decide if your cost on is aligns with the value vs you forcing us to pay you when you may not be working at all.  You can fool the idiots but I’m not one of them.

I’ve seen and used other apps that have this feature so I know it’s possible. It’s annoying to have to copy the tracking number from emails (that sometimes are just links to another page) and paste into the app. Please, please, and please provide this feature.

The subscription will only give you new feature and allow you to use their cloud sync. So there is no need to delete the app. Sadly people who are new will need the subscription though. I’m not a huge fan of subscriptions, but people do need to make a living. If they add features that are worth paying for I’ll subscribe after the complementary trial is over. But at least give it a try and see what they end up doing. If they have nothing new worth paying for, then don’t subscribe and you can still use it normally if you had previously paid. But $4.99 a year is a pretty decent price and is not much different than paying $4.99 a year for a whole new app each year, pending they add features worth paying for continuously. The added benefit is you get the features throughout the year instead of all at once and only once a year. So here is to hoping they add features worth the money.

Don’t get me wrong, there are good things about the update, but there is 1 thing in particular that I’m not happy with.  Before, you would type the tracking number and select which carrier it belongs with (UPS, FedEx, USPS, etc).  Now this is restricted based on the tracking number/characters entered - for example my package has a FedEx tracking number but FedEx has transferred it to USPS to deliver to my home.  Given that the tracking number remains the same, it doesn’t meet the USPS tracking number characters, and therefore I am unable to save it under the USPS carrier, even though they in fact will be the ones to deliver my package.  Now I’m forced to go to the USPS website to get tracking updates that I would’ve originally been able to get within the app before the tracking number restrictions/limitations for each carrier.

You download it and it’s useless without paying as you can’t add tracking. That should be clear. It seems like it’s just broken / not pasting the tracking properly but then my coworker told me you just had to pay to be able to add tracking. The subscription is cheap so not a huge deal, but definitely seems deceptive which isn’t an awesome first impression. \n\n2) Sorting functionality is weak. Only shows delivered at the top and no way to reverse sort so undelivered packages you’re waiting on are at the top instead. Yes you could archive each individual package, but this is an easy opportunity for developers to make the app more convenient. Either allow users to turn on a setting to automatically archive deliveries into a filtered area or allow users to sort by both most recent OR oldest like every other sorting feature allows. \n\n3) there is no easy way to manually update if a delivery arrives but isn’t showing on tracking. \n\nRecommend these developers do some user testing with new users not on their team / random people in their various persona groups to get some of this basic usability feedback.

If you use a “copy” action you’ll get the same info as before, with a link directly to the carrier’s tracking page.\n• The menu of Share options have been improved, and a “More…” item at the bottom makes them easier to manage.\n• Notifications can now be expanded on macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later.

For more about this change, visit juncld.com/e3FC\n• “DHL Express” is now labeled “DHL”, and supports most DHL shipments. “DHL GlobalMail” is now labeled “DHL eCommerce”.\n• Improved suggestions when adding a new delivery.\n• Improved how the Add Delivery screen shows deliveries detected on the clipboard. This simplifies the number of options available at once and allows you to dismiss the clipboard suggestions if that’s not what you wanted.\n• If there are multiple tracking numbers on the clipboard, Deliveries can detect all of them.\n• Improved how items with multiple packages refresh. For example if you have an order with one package that was already delivered, that shipment is no longer refreshed along with the others.\n• Maps for deliveries with multiple packages now emphasize the selected package. Maps in notifications focus on the route that’s relevant to the notification.\n• Map views are more efficient, and better at handling errors looking up locations. They’re less likely to animate unexpectedly while you’re adjusting the view, and they look a bit nicer too.\n• Creating a placeholder with the current date no longer automatically marks it as delivered.

Whether it's the latest gadget you've preordered online, or a new graphic novel you can't wait to dive into, Deliveries will keep tabs on it so you don't miss the doorbell.\n\nThe main list shows a summary of all your shipments and counts down the days. Select a delivery for more information, and see where it is on a map. If you like you can view the shipping company’s web page, or easily share your shipment over email, iMessage, or AirDrop. Deliveries can even add estimated delivery dates to your calendar, and a Notification Center widget lets you quickly check your packages without opening the app. All your old deliveries are archived so you can look them up again if you need to. An Apple Watch app is also included so you can see the latest updates with just a glance.\n\nDeliveries supports dozens of services, including UPS, FedEx, US Postal Service, DHL, TNT, Canada Post, and many more. You can also track orders from services like Amazon and Apple, even before they ship. (Some services are limited to specific countries—visit junecloud.com/services for details.) If you have packages from other services, just select “Other” and enter a delivery date and web site—so you can check on them when you need to and still keep everything in one place.\n\nDeliveries is also available for Mac. You can sync your deliveries between devices with iCloud or our own Junecloud sync. If you create a Junecloud account, you can add new shipments from any web browser.\n\nHave any questions?

For full details, visit juncld.com/e39G\n\n• Fixed an issue where the app might get stuck “updating” if it was unable to upgrade the database from an older version. In most cases the app is now able to upgrade the database. If it is still unable to, the problem is now handled automatically, and a new, empty database is created.\n• Improved the upgrade process to minimize freezes or crashes when handling a large database.\n• Fixed a crash that could happen if Handoff was used before the app had a chance to upgrade its database.\n• Fixed an issue that prevented suggestions from showing on the Add Delivery screen.\n• Fixed an issue where the app might needlessly download an older service update than the one included with the app.\n• Fixed an issue where parts of the app’s update process (like refreshing deliveries or syncing) might not work if the startup process was interrupted. This situation is now handled automatically.","releaseDate":"2021-09-23"},{"versionDisplay":"9.2","releaseNotes":"This is a significant update, though many of the improvements are behind the scenes. There are a large number of improvements to reliability and performance, and many smaller changes to make Deliveries easier to use.\n\n• Sharing a delivery now includes a link to deliveries.app that makes it easy for the recipient to add the item to Deliveries or view the tracking page online. If you use a “copy” action you’ll get the same info as before, with a link directly to the carrier’s tracking page.\n• The barcode scanner can now detect tracking numbers in text. It’s also faster and better at ignoring unwanted barcodes.\n• DHL shipments are now updated through deliveries.app for improved reliability and efficiency. For more about this change, visit juncld.com/e3FC\n• “DHL Express” is now labeled “DHL”, and supports most DHL shipments. “DHL GlobalMail” is now labeled “DHL eCommerce”.\n• Improved suggestions when adding a new delivery.\n• Improved how the Add Delivery screen shows deliveries detected on the clipboard. This simplifies the options available and allows you to dismiss the clipboard suggestions if that’s not what you wanted.\n• If there are multiple tracking numbers on the clipboard, Deliveries can detect all of them.\n• Improved how items with multiple packages refresh. For example if you have an order with one package that was already delivered, that shipment is no longer refreshed along with the others.\n• Maps for deliveries with multiple packages now emphasize the selected package. Maps in notifications focus on the route that’s relevant to the notification.\n• Map views are more efficient, and better at handling errors looking up locations. They’re less likely to animate unexpectedly while you’re adjusting the view, and they look a bit nicer too.\n• Creating a placeholder with the current date no longer automatically marks it as delivered. You can use the “Mark Delivered” button afterward if necessary.\n• Improved how parts of the app communicate with each other, for more immediate updates.\n• Improved syncing reliability.\n• Improvements for signing in to third-party services.\n• Item name suggestions are now ordered by when they were last used.\n• Fixed an issue where choosing an “edit an existing delivery” option on the Add Delivery screen might leave that item archived after saving. Now this will always show a “Restore” button. You can still edit the name of an existing delivery without restoring it if you use the search field to find it, open the “…” menu, and choose “Edit”.\n• Improved how the subscription view shows previous purchases.\n• Improved tracking number detection for Chronopost, DHL, La Poste, and UPS.\n• Improved link detection for DHL, USPS, and Swiss Post.\n• Improved importing from UPS.\n• Improved the appearance of the widget in situations with limited information.\n• Calendar events include the tracking number and link, and titles are limited to 64 characters.\n• The “open the app to resume background updates” notification will no longer appear if you don’t have any deliveries.\n• Fixed an unexpected error if you used certain characters in the Item Name field, like the chef emoji.\n• Localization improvements.\n• Fixed many different causes of crashes, and other reliability improvements.\n\nApple Watch:\n\n• The Apple Watch app has been completely rewritten, with many small improvements.\n• Improved syncing reliability.\n• If iCloud sync is enabled, and you have another device with Deliveries installed, the Apple Watch app can show notifications even when your iPhone is unavailable.\n• The largest text size setting now uses an alternate layout for improved accessibility.\n• The complication for the Extra Large watch face is improved on Apple Watch Series 4 or later.
