Thank you for your hard work &amp; consistency with keeping up to date sale price and the distance all offers in store are from my location at any given time! <br />    Just a suggestion to get some more traffic and downloads as I am always sharing your App with friends with the same interests and “ShopSavvy” money saving needs like me! You should come up with a referral system that would be fitting for those of us who are always looking for the best prices and can share feedback on the validity as well as experience within our reviews with certain items and retailers!</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>actually shows you what you scanned. So many apps can not find the barcode or to see it you must upgrade after downloading the app and scanning the item. <br />Good thing: After scanning the item it shows you the stores that carry it and prices so you can compare.</p>

    Gave it a try after reading mixed reviews

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>After reading some really great reviews and more recently some really poor reviews. All of the poor reviews made reference to a recent change of owners and/or updates, as the downfall of what early on seemed to be a really useful app.<br />So I was cautiously optimistic when I decided to give it a try and downloaded the app...<br />Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed to find the negative reviews were all pretty much spot on. When searching a product by name or scanning a barcode, there was long wait times 30sec-1min or more to get results. With the results being mostly online retailer’s. Even when testing a common product found at Walmart/Target the results were not reliable. <br /><br />There was also what seemed to be an excessive amount of adds compared to other free or non-premium versions of apps. And the adds wouldn’t even bother me so much if the app was functioning as described in the App Store. <br /><br />Unfortunately I have to give 1 star due to the app not having any real usable functionality.<br /><br />I had the same results when trying out this app on my iPhone 11, on my iPhone Xr(work phone), and also on my partner’s Samsung Galaxy s10.</p>
