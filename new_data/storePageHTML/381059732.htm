        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I own a mobile business with multiple appointments every day.  I have been using Week Calendar for over five years and I found it significantly more useful and easier to work with them the built-in Apple calendar.  I use iTunes to synchronize my phone calendars with my pc’s Outlook calendar and Week Calendar functions perfectly. <br /><br />The Week Calendar’s additional weekly and mini-month views are exceptionally useful for seeing an overview of scheduled appointments.  Andy interface is easy to use. The search function is great for helping to find previous appointments but unfortunately, the newest version of the app continually reverts back to a 1-year search envelope after every search.  It can be adjusted using the gear tool for a longer search envelope but setting the beginning date automatically moves the end date to one year later requiring the user to modify both dates each time they need a longer search. The older version of the app retained the previously used search dates after each search. I hope this option is re-incorporated into the next update.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this app for anyone who needs more control of their phone calendar than the built-in iPhone calendar provides<br />.</p>

    Great app that’s been my go-to calendar

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So, I’ve been a WeekCalendar user for a LONG time. I bought the app way back when it was $1.99 or $2.99 or something, before it went free with subscription and IAP support. While I’m a little sad to be bothered by requests to partake in such things, I can’t deny the software authors the right to try and keep a great product generating revenue, and this is a great product (and the IAP is a little less ever-present now than it once was in the latest release). While Apple has added some great new features to their own iOS calendar, WeekCalendar still has the best means of interacting with data a week at a time, and using it has been easy. It integrates very well with both the iOS calendar and Google calendar. If there is a complaint to be had it is that it leans quite heavily on Apple’s own Calendar app to provide some of the core functionality. Week Calendar builds on it but cannot fully supplant it. All part of Apple’s plan, perhaps?<br /><br />Update: the push to subscribe and unlock features has become more aggressive again, and I don’t need any of those functions. Were the basic free features (that I once paid for) a little less overshadowed by the pressure to buy a subscription (which many of us don’t need) I think I’d stick with it, but at this point in time Week Calendar doesn’t do enough for my basic needs to make it worth putting up with the constant proportion. So long and thanks for all the fish.</p>

    Wonderful calendar with tons of options

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>When I first write this, I had been using this app for almost a year. Now I’ve used it for many years and still really really love it. “The mini month is SO useful to me. It&#39;s just about like the month view in google calendar on a full computer. I can see all my events in one view. There&#39;s little great features too - if you have too many things to see in the mini month line (mon-sun), you can scroll down in the line without switching views. Likewise if the event has lots of details, you can scroll the window that pops up when you tap on it. You can even edit a lot of the event without needing to go to the edit window. This calendar is worlds more useful to me than the stock calendar. Oh, and I was testing CalenMob and this one seems to have more features and runs much quicker than CalenMob. There are tons of features, many of which I don&#39;t use, and he option to use them or not. Options are lovely. The only thing I&#39;d say could use improvement is that the notifications from weekcal are linked to the stock calendar and will take you there rather than weekcal if you tap on them. This hasn&#39;t been much of an issue for me as I just notice that I have an event reminder and then go straight to weekcal. Price when I got it was only $2 too. Thank you!”</p>

I have been using Week Calendar for over five years and I found it significantly more useful and easier to work with them the built-in Apple calendar.  I use iTunes to synchronize my phone calendars with my pc’s Outlook calendar and Week Calendar functions perfectly. \n\nThe Week Calendar’s additional weekly and mini-month views are exceptionally useful for seeing an overview of scheduled appointments.  Andy interface is easy to use. The search function is great for helping to find previous appointments but unfortunately, the newest version of the app continually reverts back to a 1-year search envelope after every search.  It can be adjusted using the gear tool for a longer search envelope but setting the beginning date automatically moves the end date to one year later requiring the user to modify both dates each time they need a longer search. The older version of the app retained the previously used search dates after each search. I hope this option is re-incorporated into the next update.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this app for anyone who needs more control of their phone calendar than the built-in iPhone calendar provides\n.","title":"Great app, but some minor limitations","userName":"Itsmicroman"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7290867112","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-05-02T23:25:59Z","developerResponse":{"id":22666232,"body":"Hello!

I bought the app way back when it was $1.99 or $2.99 or something, before it went free with subscription and IAP support. While I’m a little sad to be bothered by requests to partake in such things, I can’t deny the software authors the right to try and keep a great product generating revenue, and this is a great product (and the IAP is a little less ever-present now than it once was in the latest release). While Apple has added some great new features to their own iOS calendar, WeekCalendar still has the best means of interacting with data a week at a time, and using it has been easy. It integrates very well with both the iOS calendar and Google calendar. If there is a complaint to be had it is that it leans quite heavily on Apple’s own Calendar app to provide some of the core functionality. Week Calendar builds on it but cannot fully supplant it. All part of Apple’s plan, perhaps?\n\nUpdate: the push to subscribe and unlock features has become more aggressive again, and I don’t need any of those functions. Were the basic free features (that I once paid for) a little less overshadowed by the pressure to buy a subscription (which many of us don’t need) I think I’d stick with it, but at this point in time Week Calendar doesn’t do enough for my basic needs to make it worth putting up with the constant proportion.

Now I’ve used it for many years and still really really love it. “The mini month is SO useful to me. It's just about like the month view in google calendar on a full computer. I can see all my events in one view. There's little great features too - if you have too many things to see in the mini month line (mon-sun), you can scroll down in the line without switching views. Likewise if the event has lots of details, you can scroll the window that pops up when you tap on it. You can even edit a lot of the event without needing to go to the edit window. This calendar is worlds more useful to me than the stock calendar. Oh, and I was testing CalenMob and this one seems to have more features and runs much quicker than CalenMob. There are tons of features, many of which I don't use, and he option to use them or not. Options are lovely. The only thing I'd say could use improvement is that the notifications from weekcal are linked to the stock calendar and will take you there rather than weekcal if you tap on them. This hasn't been much of an issue for me as I just notice that I have an event reminder and then go straight to weekcal. Price when I got it was only $2 too.

My favorite parts are being able to assign certain types of events a specific color (such as errands being purple, appointments being bright pink, etc.) as well as auto-color, in which I assign specific to a specific name or title (such as events pertaining to my daughter). I'm a visual person and need events to stand out from each other; otherwise, everything blends in together when I’m looking for something specific.  I also have Week Calendar on my iPad.\n\nHowever, in the past week, and only on my iPhone, I have lost the ability to keep new colors that I have created as well as use auto-colors for specific events.

So when you get a notification, it’s from the Apple Calendar app; tapping on the notification takes you to the Apple Calendar app, not Week Calendar. If you don’t have the native iOS Calendar app installed, tapping on the notification takes you to the App Store to install the native iOS calendar app!\n\nFor a paid app, with a subscription plan (a subscription plan that, by the way, removed a few features that were in the paid app and now makes those available only if you subscribe and pay monthly) not having app specific notifications, etc. is ridiculous. Week Calendar explains the reason behind using the native iOS calendar for notifications on their site, but I call b.s.! This is just lazy programming! There are myriad calendar apps that all have their own app specific notifications. I’ve tried dozens of calendar apps and all the notifications worked fine; I didn’t miss any notifications, as suggested in Week Calendar’s explanation. \n\nTheir support is weak. I emailed them for support...no response. So they want to take $8 a month from me, but don’t offer support and lack some important features? I don’t think so.

First and foremost: the ability to quickly and easily place an entry onto multiple calendars. That makes it *perfect* for managing multiple calendars among multiple individuals. And having the calendar based on the native app is actually a HUGE benefit (despite other reviewers complaining about it). With the calendar information residing in the native iOS function, I can share calendars with others and they don’t have to have WeekCal installed on their device to receive appointments I’ve entered. They get all the changes, updates, deletions, and adjustments I make in WeekCal right in their native iOS calendars. How great is that?  Please, please, please don’t take that away. I would actually remove WeekCal if it didn’t work that way. Finally: I don’t want all of the “features” in the Pro version, so I’m not going to buy it.

Then you either have to manually scroll back and hope you don’t overshoot or find a a way to manually enter the actual date. Sounds trivial but beyond annoying rendering this thing useless. I have contacted customer support at least a half dozen times and was told everything from “it’ll be fixed on the next update”, “you have an old version, update to the new one”, or “switch modes to monthly instead of list and it should help.”  Are you kidding me?  My version has been updated several times. The app is not useful to me in month mode. And this bug was never fixed or addressed AT ALL during ANY of the updates.  Great lack of customer service here.  Will have to go thru the trouble of trying to transfer all of my info to a different app that actually works with customer service who actually address the problem, after all these years. Such a shame.","title":"Very disappointing customer service.","userName":":-)!"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6986196981","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-12T18:13:30Z","developerResponse":{"id":21017636,"body":"Hi Calif SLP!

You will no longer be able to swipe between months.** I updated my app and now I must subscribe to get the functionality back that I had before. I purchased this app years ago (it was not a free download). Very frustrating that users are not warned of this before updating. In mini month view, I have a pop up prompting me to subscribe. I cannot swipe to other months or use the drop down. This has been my calendar for 10 years and now I’m held hostage because I was not warned before I updated. An app should never become less functional when you update it!\nUpdate: I have contacted Week Calendar through the app. They asked questions and requested screenshots and video. I have also submitted the information they requested showing that the app was purchased 10 years ago prior to Family Share when my husband and I shared an iTunes account. For some reason, this is the update that triggered the subscription prompt (we’ve been using Family Share for awhile). My husband has the app in his phone, but doesn’t use it ever; however it is working fine. Week Calendar has not responded since I sent the info a week ago.","title":"DO NOT UPDATE!!!","userName":"Calif
