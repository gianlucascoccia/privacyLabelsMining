    Thanks for releasing apple tv app and ipad app
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>A few months ago i wrote a review asking you for apps for ipad and apple tv. You guys actually replied to that review letting us know that you had planned for both. Thanks so much. complain i now have is its very hard to search and watch new content... everything seems confusing and haphazardly placed. Also, the preview of videos are not well excecuted. If i click on series to watch. I expect it to play the episodes. But it starts playing promo first. I dont want to watch promo each time i open the app to play an episode of a series that i have already started watching... Please revamp the UI. But the quality if content is amazing!!!!! Thanks!</p>

    Content for younger people... Subtitles too small
</h3>



      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>
        

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Themes are interesting for younger more than older people probably. I&#39;m in my forties and found boring. Disappointed because it had an actor I loved from Laakhon mein ek but this show was less deep. American channels have bigger subtitles in English which I prefer. Found myself having to look down too long at subtitles. Nice aesthetics to the shows which I enjoyed. Writers could use work in my opinion. Production quality or at least quality of shows transmitted were rough on my iPad. Can&#39;t imagine watching on TV if it&#39;s this bad on my iPad unless it&#39;s better on TV. Content too silly for me or too irritating in terms of characters. After watching some content from India making it to America on other platforms I was disappointed.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Guys, you need to hire better app developers and fix the issues with app, specially casting functionality. The app is out of layout, outdated and super buggy! Accessibility is super hard and the most annoying thing is that once app goes in the background it starts from the beginning when it comes back to foreground.</p>

We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the TVF Services to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the TVF Services, and to customize Content and advertising.

We may collect information through other kinds of local storage (also referred to as \"Flash cookies\") and HTML5 local storage, including in connection with features such as volume/mute settings for the Video Player. Because these technologies are similar to browser cookies, they are sometimes called \"browser cookies,\" even though they may be stored in different parts of your computer. We use other technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, some of these technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. We may use these and various other technologies for similar purposes as cookies, such as to enforce our terms, prevent fraud, and analyze the use of our service. There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding these technologies. For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area; see your browser's help function or support area to learn more. Please note that disabling cookies or deleting information contained in cookies or Flash cookies may interfere with the performance and features of the TVF Services, including the Video Player.

Advertising Identifiers: Advertising identifiers are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the \"Identifier for Advertisers\" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the \"Google Advertising ID\" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, advertising identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant. \nd. Mobile Device Identifiers and Software Development Kits (\"SDKs\"): We may use or work with third parties including our business partners and service providers who use mobile SDKs to collect information, such as advertising identifiers (e.g., \"ad-ID\" or \"IDFA\") and information related to how mobile devices interact with the TVF Services. An SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected and related services and functionality to be implemented.

We may collect information through other kinds of local storage (also referred to as \"Flash cookies\") and HTML5 local storage, including in connection with features such as volume/mute settings for the Video Player. Because these technologies are similar to browser cookies, they are sometimes called \"browser cookies,\" even though they may be stored in different parts of your computer.

Like cookies, some of these technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. We may use these and various other technologies for similar purposes as cookies, such as to enforce our terms, prevent fraud, and analyze the use of our service.

Mobile Device Identifiers and Software Development Kits (\"SDKs\"): We may use or work with third parties including our business partners and service providers who use mobile SDKs to collect information, such as advertising identifiers (e.g., \"ad-ID\" or \"IDFA\") and information related to how mobile devices interact with the TVF Services. An SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected and related services and functionality to be implemented.
