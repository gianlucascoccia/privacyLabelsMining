Often it’s hard to remember what and why we ate. \n\nMindless eating has an impact on health — physical, mental, and emotional. \nDiets and other quick fixes don’t work in the long run. Sometimes they even cause more stress and frustration.\n\nAte was built with this in mind. It’s a judgement-free mindful diary that is thoughtfully designed to help increase self-awareness of eating habits, behaviors, and feelings. \n\nAte is an easy to use food journal built around positive reinforcement. It fits easily into life and is a joy to use. Ate reveals existing healthy behaviors and shows how to turn them into healthy habits. Ate also provides guidance on how to turn unhealthy habits into healthy ones. \n\nAte worked with health professionals around the world and built this app on journaling techniques that have been proven over decades.\n\nAte Food Journal is not about crash diets or restrictive living by calorie counting. It’s about building a sustainable and healthy lifestyle. A better version of one’s self, one small habit at a time. One that is easily maintained and enjoyed in the long run.\n\nDownload the Ate Food Diary today and start on a new path!\n\nRegarding Privacy:\nAte does not run ads. \nAte does not share personal data with others, ever. \nAte respects privacy, as a top priority. \n\nSubscription Details\nAte requires a subscription and comes with a 7-day FREE trial. \nSign up for monthly or yearly auto-renewing plans which will start at the end of the FREE trial period.

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>After YouFood ended, I was lost. I loved taking pics of my food to keep a journal, but at some point, I realized that habitually taking the photo just became habit and I always wished for more.  So far, it seems that “Ate” has it.  First, as simple s concept as it is, I love, love, love the on and off path option. Actively saying that I am “on path” is an motivator😇 that I did not anticipate. Likewise, who wants to admit that they’re “off path” 🤷🏽‍♀️? I also love the integration of my water and exercise efforts as well. I’ve only been doing it for three days, so I haven’t really gotten into all of the other benefits but I also like the idea of tracking why I eat, whether I eat at home or out, how the meal was prepared, how I was feeling when I ate and a big one...who I ate with 😉!  I have a feeling that in time, I’m going to see some real trends that will expose for me why I eat the way I eat and more importantly how much I eat. Aside from always saying “I just love food”, that’s a question that I don’t think I’ve truly figured out just yet.  Now, I just need to find some friends for more accountability.  I’m trying the upgrade and had marked my calendar to cancel after 14 days, planning to be unfulfilled, but I know already that I’m in.  Yearly plan paid for.  Wish me luck!  P.S.  I swear I’m not a developer or a friend or family member of theirs and I can prove it.  Just try it and see for yourself!  😂😂</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve tried myfitnesspal calorie counting, daily photo journals, and also just writing out the food but the interface of this app is aesthetically pleasing and visually appealing as well as directed. The option to chose “off path” or “on path” with the reminder of what your current goal is at the top of the screen is brilliantly simple and helps me to minimize obsessive food thoughts like “I ate so bad I’m so fat” or “i ate an apple today so that makes up for the ice cream and chips and cookies I ate the rest of the day” etc etc. It even lets you make a collage of your food pictures at the end of the day, which is a perfect way to visualize what you’re putting into your body. Oh, and you can track calories in the comments under your picture but you can also track where you ate, if you ate alone or with people, why you ate, and how it made you feel which is a genius way to help people make the lifestyle change into eating healthier (instead of forcing yourself to eat ‘healthy’ foods you despise you can focus on the healthy foods you adore). I’ve been searching for an app like this for years and I’m very happy I’ve finally come across it. I hope to use it for a while, and I really appreciate that it’s a free app with no ads. Hands down my favorite health app.</p>

        <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been using ate for about a week, and there are several things I love about it: <br />1. Flexibility. The app allows me to define my own goal, how I want to try to achieve it, and which factors I want to track. <br />2. Ease. Tracking calories is tedious, especially if you cook a lot of your own food, and it can be impossible when you eat out. And really, I know when I’m making healthy choices and when I’m not. With ate, all I have to do is take a quick photo (only momentarily awkward over lunch with colleagues) and follow up later to answer a few questions about it.<br />3. Positivity. The app encourages me to think about how I make choices about food and how those choices make me feel, rather than focusing solely on calories or weight goals. This seems more sustainable — if I feel better today because I ate better, I’m likely to continue eating better, instead of giving up because I’m discouraged by my slowly changing body. I also like that the app subtly encourages me to aim to be 70% to 90% on track, as a reminder not to get down on myself for occasional treats.<br />4. Graphs! I love data. And since I tend to compartmentalize poor dietary choices from meal to meal and day to day, it’s exactly what I need to give myself perspective on how I’m doing overall, not just today.</p>

I loved taking pics of my food to keep a journal, but at some point, I realized that habitually taking the photo just became habit and I always wished for more.  So far, it seems that “Ate” has it.  First, as simple s concept as it is, I love, love, love the on and off path option. Actively saying that I am “on path” is an motivator😇 that I did not anticipate. Likewise, who wants to admit that they’re “off path” 🤷🏽‍♀️? I also love the integration of my water and exercise efforts as well. I’ve only been doing it for three days, so I haven’t really gotten into all of the other benefits but I also like the idea of tracking why I eat, whether I eat at home or out, how the meal was prepared, how I was feeling when I ate and a big one...who I ate with 😉!  I have a feeling that in time, I’m going to see some real trends that will expose for me why I eat the way I eat and more importantly how much I eat. Aside from always saying “I just love food”, that’s a question that I don’t think I’ve truly figured out just yet.  Now, I just need to find some friends for more accountability.  I’m trying the upgrade and had marked my calendar to cancel after 14 days, planning to be unfulfilled, but I know already that I’m in.  Yearly plan paid for.  Wish me luck!  P.S.

The option to chose “off path” or “on path” with the reminder of what your current goal is at the top of the screen is brilliantly simple and helps me to minimize obsessive food thoughts like “I ate so bad I’m so fat” or “i ate an apple today so that makes up for the ice cream and chips and cookies I ate the rest of the day” etc etc. It even lets you make a collage of your food pictures at the end of the day, which is a perfect way to visualize what you’re putting into your body. Oh, and you can track calories in the comments under your picture but you can also track where you ate, if you ate alone or with people, why you ate, and how it made you feel which is a genius way to help people make the lifestyle change into eating healthier (instead of forcing yourself to eat ‘healthy’ foods you despise you can focus on the healthy foods you adore). I’ve been searching for an app like this for years and I’m very happy I’ve finally come across it. I hope to use it for a while, and I really appreciate that it’s a free app with no ads.

The app allows me to define my own goal, how I want to try to achieve it, and which factors I want to track. \n2. Ease. Tracking calories is tedious, especially if you cook a lot of your own food, and it can be impossible when you eat out. And really, I know when I’m making healthy choices and when I’m not. With ate, all I have to do is take a quick photo (only momentarily awkward over lunch with colleagues) and follow up later to answer a few questions about it.\n3. Positivity. The app encourages me to think about how I make choices about food and how those choices make me feel, rather than focusing solely on calories or weight goals. This seems more sustainable — if I feel better today because I ate better, I’m likely to continue eating better, instead of giving up because I’m discouraged by my slowly changing body. I also like that the app subtly encourages me to aim to be 70% to 90% on track, as a reminder not to get down on myself for occasional treats.\n4. Graphs! I love data. And since I tend to compartmentalize poor dietary choices from meal to meal and day to day, it’s exactly what I need to give myself perspective on how I’m doing overall, not just today.","title":"So far, so good!","userName":"Amber Waves Hello"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6539367954","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-16T00:23:49Z","developerResponse":{"id":19964891,"body":"Helping you transform your relationship with food is what we strive for.

I’m able to share this app with my nutritionist and she can have an idea of what I am eating in a day without me having to track. The summary questions have allowed me to have a much better relationship with my meals, realizing trends and habits that I may not have realized before. It forces me to slow down and ask myself these important questions. I love it. \n\nI also have noticed great management of this app. I’ve never felt more personally connected to an app developing company than with this app. After reading the app updates, you can tell this is a small company that is properly run by people who truly care for their community.

Ate allows me to see what I eat in a day and it lets me record how it made me feel (I LOVE this part of the app because I struggle with how food makes me feel). I also love that it adds options such as “who did you eat with?” and “where did you eat?” Overall this app seems perfect for me and I hope I continue to use this to track my food habits. \n\nThe only thing I can think of that I could suggest is to add a way to type something instead of just selecting “Happy” as a feeling for example. I’d like to be able to write a small sentence or come up with my own words as to how my meal made me feel. Same with the others like “where did you eat?”.

I have tried weight loss techniques in the past such as Weight Watchers, calorie counting, and intermittent fasting, and none of them felt sustainable to me, as I always felt deprived, restricted, stressed out, and never felt truly nourished. However, I do feel that I need some sort of structure in order to make healthy choices and eat mindfully. I am really loving this app for that purpose! I’ve tried a few of the experiments and am currently trying out taking two deep breaths before eating, and I have noticed a much more mindful and enjoyable experience when I eat. The act of taking a picture and reflecting on my meal also helps me be more mindful and choose foods that make me feel nourished. I feel I’m able to listen to my body’s cues better and I’ve felt much better in general. I love food and cooking, so it’s also really satisfying to have a visual diary of my meals, and I love that there is no judgment about what I eat, so there’s room for fun meals with friends.

After listening to a podcast that focuses heavily on mental aspects of weight loss I thought to myself it would be awesome if I could just snap photos of my food for myself to stay accountable. I began searching the app store for such a thing as a “visual diary” and ran into Ate. \n\nThis is absolutely perfect. I love how it is set up and that I can use the option to have a meal be counted as several photos taken within the same hour. I didn’t realize that handy option until searching the settings on day 2. This is Exactly how someone needs to learn to lose weight when they tend to have portion control problems such as myself. Having to take a photo of my meal and answer some simple, mindful questions is enough to turn my eating habits around. \n\nSeriously, Ate, you really have a great product and I hope you keep this free version around forever.

I also like the freedom to change what is “on path” for me - since it’s not specific to one type of eating. I really love the little arrow that encourages me to make a healthier choice for my next meal if I do go off path - it’s not judgy and unlike other things I’ve tried, I don’t tend to feel like I’ve “ruined” a day with one meal or food, so I’m more likely to just move on and eat something that is better for me at the next meal rather than derail and start again the next day (or week or whatever!).

The benefits are already so evident.  Having to actually document what, when, and how much you are eating really makes me think twice before eating too much or eating things that aren’t as good for me, which are 2 big goals for me.  Also, because my friends and I follow each other on the app, it’s actually EXCITING to take a picture of my home-cooked, healthy meals or any other instances where I’m making good food choices!  I have also loved tracking how eating made me feel, which is one of the questions the app asks you after your meal.  Tracking my meals is quick and easy, which is important to me, and I’m going to keep using ate!  Highly recommend if you’re like me and struggle sometimes with being mindful with your eating!","title":"Super helpful and easy to use!","userName":"ILJ627"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5756550352","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-03T15:43:17Z","developerResponse":{"id":19964936,"body":"Happy to hear that you are finding our mindful food diary so helpful and that we are able to support you in these difficult crazy times. ","modified":"2020-12-23T22:10:18Z"},"rating":5,"review":"This is only my second day using the app but it has brought me such peace and joy.  Taking photos of my meals felt strange to me at first but what I realized is that it really promotes mindfulness and reflection.  You can make notes that go along with the picture, creating a new kind of ritual practice that slows down your meal nicely and easily.  I like all the tracking in terms of hunger level, satisfaction, etc.  But perhaps my favorite thing of all are the “experiments” you get to try.  The one I chose to start with is to take 2 deep breaths before eating.  Even that simple act allows me to connect to my body and spirit so that I can listen to my physical and emotional needs.  My lifelong struggle with stress eating has been exasperated due to the COVID-19 situation.  I didn’t want to spiral back down into the overeating so I found this app. I couldn’t be happier, calmer, or feeling more grounded around food.  Thank you to the creators and developers!!!","title":"Fantastic and amazing!!!","userName":"Crb1717"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1287924580","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"Access to all our Premium features"},"isMerchandisedEnabled":false,"isMerchandisedVisibleByDefault":false,"isSubscription":true,"name":"Food Journal Premium -
