      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I frequently travel especially to New York City and downloaded this app to keep tabs on daily weather report, traffic, road closures and local news.  Since then, I kept the app even back at my hometown In Hawaii because it sends important news directly to my iPhone lock screen and just swipe right from the lock screen to view the article easily.  Now I’m vacationing in Japan and I immediately heard of news back in U.S.  The app is easy to use, just download it and allow notification when it prompt you at setup.  You can have news you can use and be aware of what’s happening in the world.  It only does push notification on top stories so it’s not too much notification.  Thank you for the app, keep up the good work!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Lists local &amp; national news stories, by category.  Sometimes stories don’t change frequently — especially in some sections.  Other sections are video only, with no text.  One glitch: It provides pop-up alerts for breaking news that connect to a story/ the app, but sometimes the news story has not been posted on the app so if you miss the pop-up alert alert/ aren’t able to tap on the pop-up message, you won’t see the breaking news story until it is posted on the app, which can take a bit.  Tapping the pop-up alert links to the message, but that story is somehow not on the app page.  Hard to explain, but frustrating...</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>When I worked in the corporate world, I only watched NBC to get my day started, because I could relate to their anchors the most — they felt like “my tribe”, with the same sense of humor as me. Although I left the corporate world a long time ago and no longer watch the news (it’s too depressing), I still want to know when important events happen that could affect me and my family.  Enter the NBC 4 NY app and its Breaking News feature....<br /><br /> Although when the COVID pandemic started, they overused that functionality, because when the new cases *doubled* (which made it sound very dramatic) from 4 to 8, for example, I have to admit I was a little annoyed. If the cases doubled from 400 to 800 overnight, THAT would’ve been “breaking news.”<br /><br /> I give the app four stars, because it keeps me informed, and I like that the news is separated by type. It’s much better than going to WNBC’s mobile website.  Some articles, however, take too long to load. Sometimes, there is only a video available — I understand that this is a news station’s app, but I prefer to read my news (it “registers” better with me), so having a transcript available for every video would be nice.<br /><br />Thank you for being there for me all these years!</p>

Although I left the corporate world a long time ago and no longer watch the news (it’s too depressing), I still want to know when important events happen that could affect me and my family.  Enter the NBC 4 NY app and its Breaking News feature....\n\n Although when the COVID pandemic started, they overused that functionality, because when the new cases *doubled* (which made it sound very dramatic) from 4 to 8, for example, I have to admit I was a little annoyed. If the cases doubled from 400 to 800 overnight, THAT would’ve been “breaking news.”\n\n I give the app four stars, because it keeps me informed, and I like that the news is separated by type. It’s much better than going to WNBC’s mobile website.  Some articles, however, take too long to load. Sometimes, there is only a video available — I understand that this is a news station’s app, but I prefer to read my news (it “registers” better with me), so having a transcript available for every video would be nice.\n\nThank you for being there for me all these years!","title":"BREAKING NEWS: it’s a great app!","userName":"CityKatH13"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3392434633","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-11-07T22:32:43Z","rating":5,"review":"I was looking for a decent weather app. This turned out to be the best weather app I ever used plus a very good news app all rolled up together.
