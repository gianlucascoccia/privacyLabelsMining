      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The game was great, but now is going to be a long slow grind that to be honest is not worth it.  The main problem with this game is that you going to regret the time you invest in it. The developers are plain out bad. They don’t really listen to their community or fix tickets.  They release new top tiers superstars about every 4 months, and those stars are stuck in a loot case that is very hard to unlock. Even if you pay for the loot case, guess what you have 1% chance to unlock one of those rare superstars. Like any loot case game most of the cases are not balance. They say is 1%, but some cases like the top tier stars cases you unlock the same characters like 3 times even if you suppose to have the same chance of unlocking all top tier stars equality. And you guess it, the one you unlock 3 times are the same weak low tier characters. The game updates sometimes miss the schedule so you miss major wwe events, and now they took the pop offers that gave you the ability to upgrade characters without grinding for months. WWE is a great universe, but this game is a constant disappointed, after this new change, I am done with. There is a mode that they been promoting for a year now and haven’t been release either. When it does, I wouldn’t be shock that it doesn’t live to the hype.  Save yourself some time and stay away from this game.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Great game but where is the NXT UK characters we want Walter and imperium and many other NXT UK wrestlers also it’s hard to unlock the four star and up characters you want ppl to pay for a mayhem pass every other week i honestly thought it was a one time thing but seems you guys are jus tryna make buck off us every opportunity you all get this game is excellent but bro listen to the wwe universe y’all are literally ignoring these comments and it’s blasphemy! This could be the best wwe game out but at times like these no one is paying for some part-time loot on a app make it easier or make it free we need things to play to get us through these tough times we can’t just dish out 50 bucks and pray we get a five star it’s not realistic it’s not happening I’m literally jus playing story And daily mode cause my highest wrestler is 350 i have no shot at upgrading not enough gold i literally jus log in everyday jus for the free offer I’m jus not playing it as much anymore it’s a good setup great game but it’s not for the beginners out here and it’s money based all around you gotta pay for something to get it and it’s jus not worth it</p>

The main problem with this game is that you going to regret the time you invest in it. The developers are plain out bad. They don’t really listen to their community or fix tickets.  They release new top tiers superstars about every 4 months, and those stars are stuck in a loot case that is very hard to unlock. Even if you pay for the loot case, guess what you have 1% chance to unlock one of those rare superstars. Like any loot case game most of the cases are not balance. They say is 1%, but some cases like the top tier stars cases you unlock the same characters like 3 times even if you suppose to have the same chance of unlocking all top tier stars equality. And you guess it, the one you unlock 3 times are the same weak low tier characters. The game updates sometimes miss the schedule so you miss major wwe events, and now they took the pop offers that gave you the ability to upgrade characters without grinding for months. WWE is a great universe, but this game is a constant disappointed, after this new change, I am done with. There is a mode that they been promoting for a year now and haven’t been release either. When it does, I wouldn’t be shock that it doesn’t live to the hype.

In one match, which lasted maybe 10-15 seconds of playing time.. I had 3 network errors interrupt me that lasted almost a minute each. Increase the amount of servers you have so that more players can be online at the same time. If this network error gets fixed, it can easily be a 5 star game. I’ll recommend \u0026 share once the network errors are gone.\n\nEvery WWE game on the App Store has network errors, Supercard was beyond frustrating. I wish all the developers would stop underestimating the WWE Universe, we are far bigger than you can possibly imagine. Prepare for the servers to be flooded, but take the time to increase the servers so that it doesn’t happen.

A great mix of wrestling superstars from the 80’s to today makes me want to collect them all to play with. The arcade style action could use a bit of tweaking in the controls as it seems a bit sluggish at times, but overall it’s pretty much pick up and play. I really like how the store clearly states the chance you have of receiving each superstar with a percentage number. This is very honest and up front and wish other micro transaction games would be as forthcoming. Speaking of micro transaction gaming, I’ve seen and played some that request ridiculous sums of money for loot ($50-$100 for loot cases!) and I’m happy to see that $20 is the max I’ve seen so far in Mayhem. To me, that’s not too bad at all and you get quite a bit of loot for that 20 bucks.

I mean I can play events with them but on story mode I’m using my 4* guy more \u0026 more. Suggestions: make it a little bit  easier to get 4*s. Just a little. Maybe give players on a certain level like a 4* a month or something. Make it worth working for bc after I reached level 30 to add the 5th team guy idc if I level up or not now. Maybe add a LEGENDS loot case \u0026 have sum old guys that’s not in the game. I think once a player has reached a certain level they outta get a better reward for their work \u0026 loyalty to the game. Add sum more special cage matches.

But, the problem with this concept is that I keep getting nothing but 2 Star Superstars.

They lead you to believe that rewards are random, but they absolutely aren’t!!! They shouldn’t have stronger wrestlers in the briefcases if you can’t actually get them. I understand you have to progress to get stronger guys, but I don’t like how they trick you into thinking it might land on one. Also, it’s REALLY time consuming getting a tiny level-up piece here and there, which does nothing til you have a bunch of them. And if your health runs out, don’t wait for it to replenish, because it won’t!! But you can easily buy more with gold, did I mention that costs real money? Game is just a money grab filled with trickery and lies... Oh, and the BEST is when you have your opponent down to 0 health, and you can’t actually win, because you need to do a move to get them to the mat. But they reverse EVERY move, so you end up at 0 health after they reverse all your moves, then they pin you... AND you’re back to buying gold to revive and heal...
