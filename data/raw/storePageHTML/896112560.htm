Kabam’s beautiful brawler gives you control of dozens of beloved heroes and villains as you punch, kick, and blast your way across the Marvel universe. A simple and intuitive set of attacks, counters, and special attacks make for edge-of-your-seat combat, but you’ll spend just as much time finding and upgrading your super-team. Figuring out the best way to use them is key to surviving bouts with relentless opponents—and progressing through treacherous story quests.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is the best marvel game I’ve ever had (and the only one)! But let me just say it would be awesome if they added some more champions. But before I go into the update suggestions, I have a question: is there supposed to be a Thanos with the infinity gauntlet? Because I’ve seen some videos where Thanos had the IG but I don’t see him with it. I would appreciate if you got back to me about that question. Anyways, update suggestions. I know you don’t have a mode to where you can’t actually duel and fight other players, and I’m serious, I totally get that. But I’m sure it’s possible to turn the player around and for the controls to be the same. And also, I would be cool to have the iron venom (iron man and venom mixed) I saw a LEGO set with iron venom and he looked like a boss! It would be cool to add a venom update soon because he’s one of my favorite champions. Also, it would be awesome if you had a customizable champion mode or maybe a sandbox mode where you can test out champions you don’t have and/or face any champion you want. And lastly, it would be cool to have skins for certain champions like for iron man, it could be suits from the past or Scarlett witch age of Ultron appearance or cull obsidian with his mechanical claw. That’s all my suggestions, but I would definitely ask you to get back to this response and keep the updates coming!!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Have made about 5 or more accounts of this, some of the reason I had to make so many were my fault because I forgot a couple of my account infos when I got new phones and just can’t log in them anymore. The other reason is the data was just lost, I opened my phone one day to play a couple years ago and my account was gone, this happened a couple times also. And now, I get hit with this, I’m spinning a 4 Star crystal after nine levels of incursion, and as I’m about to land on Archangel, the game crashes and then I got stuck with Gambit. I was so close to such a good 4 star and the game crashes and then I get stuck with an inferior champion because the game was bein screwy. I’m pretty upset about that, things like this have happened in the past quite a few times, it’s irritating, but other than these little problems I keep having it’s an amazing game with a great combat system, awesome storyline and side stories plus random events and missions, fantastic game. I love the game 5/5, however if someone could get back to me about the whole, me losing my account randomly and then I can’t log into it anymore and it’s just gone, and the game crashing and ruining my experience and making me lose great champions for trashcan champions, make sure these things stop happening.</p>

But let me just say it would be awesome if they added some more champions. But before I go into the update suggestions, I have a question: is there supposed to be a Thanos with the infinity gauntlet? Because I’ve seen some videos where Thanos had the IG but I don’t see him with it. I would appreciate if you got back to me about that question. Anyways, update suggestions. I know you don’t have a mode to where you can’t actually duel and fight other players, and I’m serious, I totally get that. But I’m sure it’s possible to turn the player around and for the controls to be the same. And also, I would be cool to have the iron venom (iron man and venom mixed) I saw a LEGO set with iron venom and he looked like a boss! It would be cool to add a venom update soon because he’s one of my favorite champions. Also, it would be awesome if you had a customizable champion mode or maybe a sandbox mode where you can test out champions you don’t have and/or face any champion you want. And lastly, it would be cool to have skins for certain champions like for iron man, it could be suits from the past or Scarlett witch age of Ultron appearance or cull obsidian with his mechanical claw. That’s all my suggestions, but I would definitely ask you to get back to this response and keep the updates coming!!","title":"Great game but need some fixes","userName":"Tryagain716"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7039881653","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-26T08:07:29Z","rating":5,"review":"Have made about 5 or more accounts of this, some of the reason I had to make so many were my fault because I forgot a couple of my account infos when I got new phones and just can’t log in them anymore. The other reason is the data was just lost, I opened my phone one day to play a couple years ago and my account was gone, this happened a couple times also. And now, I get hit with this, I’m spinning a 4 Star crystal after nine levels of incursion, and as I’m about to land on Archangel, the game crashes and then I got stuck with Gambit. I was so close to such a good 4 star and the game crashes and then I get stuck with an inferior champion because the game was bein screwy. I’m pretty upset about that, things like this have happened in the past quite a few times, it’s irritating, but other than these little problems I keep having it’s an amazing game with a great combat system, awesome storyline and side stories plus random events and missions, fantastic game. I love the game 5/5, however if someone could get back to me about the whole, me losing my account randomly and then I can’t log into it anymore and it’s just gone, and the game crashing and ruining my experience and making me lose great champions for trashcan champions, make sure these things stop happening.","title":"Amazing game, slight recurring problem","userName":"G-EAZY6464"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2925563788","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-07-17T21:15:22Z","developerResponse":{"id":679612,"body":"Thanks for the update!

I love this game and can still see/feel the potential here. That being said, coming from a game development background, Kabam seriously needs to be more transparent as well as fix what is STILL broken. Every update brings new things, good AND bad. Pushing the envelope is great, but pushing it while things are broken is not a good way to keep players. Recruiting is becoming hard. Players are leery of continuing. I get that keeping this thing running is tough, but many other companies(including your parent company) handle issues and player problems much differently and efficiently! You've got me as a long term player, and I know there are plenty of others out there. I want to give a 4+ review, but I can't do that until y'all fix the current issues, just listen to your players/customers.\n\n*Old: I'll upgrade my review to 3 stars. They are making progress but still have a long way to go in terms of a potentially great game.\n\nI've played this game since almost the beginning. There have been a lot of changes over the 2 years, most of them have been good for the game and balance.  HOWEVER, the 12.0 patch has literally made the game into something completely different and has so many bugs that it is practically unplayable.  I have hope Kabam/NetMarble will come to their senses and fix what they broke. Until that time, 2 stars is the best I can rate it.","title":"This game had/has great potential.

Unfortunately, the game is littered with a bunch of series of the sort for rewards that are just the same style of competition with the same game mechanics used in every game type, the only thing that is changed is the rewards. Although I never bother with that and only play a little of the story mode, which includes a basic brain dead story and multiple paths that can be replayed with no indicators of which path you played before, I usually always play versus 1v1. Although this game mode is fun to play and quick/easy to just pick up a few games to have fun, the battles will sometimes pit me against enemy’s that have high advantages over my characters, doing more damage to me and taking less of it from me. Other times I’ll face an enemy that is hopelessly outmatched and will go down with 10 light attacks. The game never fairly balances fights. When it does, it feels great because the competition is fair and rewarding when won or understandable when lost, but this rarely happens. I’ll still play, but usually when I get paired against high level enemies that will destroy me in 5 hits while my 20+ hits to them does 30% damage over and over, I’ll quit and play a new game app altogether. If that were to be fixed, the game would be perfect as it is, at least in the sector of overall gameplay.","title":"Fun and easy mechanics with disappointing elements throughout","userName":"Jdkdnelcjekdiwmnec"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2684754914","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-06-13T02:16:25Z","rating":5,"review":"This game has been amazing so far I originally picked it up around it’s release and then somehow lost my games data but around this year I got it again and to my surprise I had everything I used to have so as a seasoned summoner who has been playing this game for a few months (again) I find that this game is incredible and I don’t mind the really expensive crystals and anything else pay to win the game is still fun but if the quest crystals could include energy or increase the chance for it so I could play the game more often that’d be great! But that’s not all I find that a lot of the older champions fight in a really similar way like Thor and Ronan nothing is much different about them they both have the same exact effects and specials and that bothers me a little bit but not too much. The only main complaint here is energy and it would just be fantastic if some of the older or newer champs had unique combos like domino or massacre. ALSO last thing I promise there should be more champs available for exploration so the newer players could start off nicely and for the older players to expand their roster or dupe their champs.  Anyways that’s all but thank you for making this one of my favorite games to play in my free time keep up the amazing work.","title":"Games great and fun but....","userName":"Kanathen"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2843711696","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-07-05T17:04:54Z","rating":4,"review":"I have been playing Marvel Contest of Champions for about 2 years, and it is by far the best mobile game I have ever played. But as you progress further down into the meat of the game, map 5 and 6 of alliance quest and tier 3 and bellow alliance war, the game loses the fun and the wallet wars comience. With the 4th of July offers showing us that Kabam favors the big spender, shown in the all father Odín a offer where if purchased 3 time, would grant a full tier 5 basic and 2 tier 2 alpha catalysts, the minimum spenders and free to play player in the beginning stages and end game are at a HUGE disadvantage. Kabam needs to get there head in the game, and think about the community, and not how full their wallets are. As a side note, I would like to see and new 5 star crystal system added, where instead of trying for every champion, you can pay a bit more shards and specify what champions you want to try for. For example, if you want to try for one of the avengers ( Spider Man Stark Enhanced, Captain America, Hawkeye, etc) you could pay some where along the lines of 2500 to 5000 extra 5 star shards to guarantee one of those champions, instead of a trying the 10k basic pool for a less than 1% chance at the specific champ you want. All in all, Kabam has made a great game, but with the issues I have discussed about above be resolved, it would go from great, to incredible.","title":"Great game, Bad End Game","userName":"metalsonicdude"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3139678259","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-09-01T05:35:23Z","rating":3,"review":"The game is tons of fun so far and I love these types of games where you collect more powerful characters as you go on. Of course to all great things there’s a problem with them. This games arena is kinda unbalanced for those who don’t pay to win. I was testing a new character I got and I had only 3 wins at the time and it paired me up with a guy with 89 wins. What the heck am I gonna go against a guy who’s got twice my power. And if you win or loose your hero gets a 2 hour cool down which is kinda dumb. You have to use the items that you save up to get hero’s with to reuse them or wait the 2 hours. I would understand 1 hour or even 30 minutes, but 2 hours is crazy. Also there are some game mechanics like effects that happen after an attack that are completely stupid like bleed or daze. With bleed you hit then play defensive and with daze you just beat the crap out of them when they can’t do anything and that’s is kinda broken. The game itself is fun, but the pvp needs some work. (Updating review) pvp in this game is so bad at choosing who fights who. I chose my bronze two star wolverine and it put me against a two star silver advanced iron man, the perfect counter to me, and he had twice my power level. I literally did at max 25 damage on higher critical hits and he did 4 to 9% of my health per health per hit so I got destroyed even though I combed a 25 hit combo. So it needs fixing.","title":"Great game, but it’s pay to win","userName":"Flame Splasher"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2356057168","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-03-28T15:04:39Z","developerResponse":{"id":3230454,"body":"Thank you for sharing your feedback about The Contest.

Loads of fun but a few things I think that could improve the game would have gotten a 5 Star out of me. First, I think the game should allow you to purchase energy and health potions with gold. The units are hard enough to come by yet alone what you are in need of spending it on. You don’t receive enough units in the game to spend on everything you need. It takes lots of playing and saving to get what you want. Throwing energy and health potions in the mix makes it all the harder especially if the only thing you really use gold for is to upgrade characters. Eventually you have an overstock supply of gold with nothing to do with it in between upgrading because you need to first get enough iso units. Second, the drop rates are becoming ridiculous. You spin more times or not getting duplicate characters then you do receiving someone new. I get trying to make characters rare but the drop rates could be a little better to still hold value and keep players interested. Lastly, character individuality! Some moves are the same amongst characters. Put a splash of their own character into it with their respective time eras. All the captain americas or black panthers shouldn’t be the same moves. Otherwise all this the game is still great. This could also increase player time.","title":"Game review","userName":"kindofimportant001"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2402801473","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-04-09T17:07:55Z","rating":4,"review":"The system in place for you to continue moving through each contest is rather annoying. I get it, app developers/companies want to make a profit. I’m all for the system of offering people the choice to spend money or “fight” their way to upgrading/unlocking new characters, or certain items. But the limited “lightning bolt” (amount of forward moves through each contest) system is rather frustrating. I open the app, play for 10-15 minutes, and then I’m already out of turns. You do receive tokens when you win matches that you can exchange for more “lightning bolts”, but it comes to a point where you run out of those as well. The “lightning bolt” system is fine in theory, but give me a larger amount to work with so I can enjoy the game for longer, or else I’ll probably end up moving to the lesser Injustice II game, cuz at least I can play for a longer duration. Maybe allow users to use some of the gold that ends up just sitting there to purchase more turns/bolts. Also, “catalysts” (the item that lets you upgrade your characters Star/Level) are really hard to come by and sometimes take weeks to obtain. You obviously don’t wanna make it easy, but spending weeks just to get 1 is kinda ridiculous. Otherwise, solid game all around.","title":"This is an awesome game, BUT...","userName":"Dnick290"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2790150307","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-06-28T17:35:24Z","rating":1,"review":"First of all I would like to say I love this game have been playing for over two years and gone through the ups and downs of previous changes to the Meta. Overall I enjoyed this game and it is a way that I have used to escape the reality of every day life a little bit. The proposed changes to alliance war for season three are making me second-guess myself and this game as a way to enjoy my free time. There has never been a change in the game that has been more geared towards pay to win mentality. I spend enough on this game as it is and now, with the proposed changes, it seems as though I will not be able to win decent rewards for the alliance war season 3 if I do not pay for things like revives and health potions to continue fighting in alliance war. There are so many other things that we can purchase from the game for the owners to still make money. These changes to alliance war and especially not offering rank down tickets to those of us who took the time and spent the resources to upgrade diverse champions for war defense is preposterous. A change this big to the Meta of the game warrants providing your customers with rank down tickets. It is my sincerest hope that the owners and creators of marvel contest of champions will hear my and so many other voices of concern from all the players/customers that enjoy this game on a daily basis. Until that time comes, I cannot see myself continuing with this game or spending one penny more.","title":"BoycottMCOC2018","userName":"Bluebear76413"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"597366721","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"555588306","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"737676890","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"560104652","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1323413722","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1011682252","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"896112560-ios","type":"media/app-platform","attributes":{"hasMessagesExtension":false,"isHiddenFromSpringboard":false,"offers":[{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=0\u0026salableAdamId=896112560\u0026pricingParameters=STDQ\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=840413794","type":"get","priceFormatted":"$0.00","price":0,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":253568000}]},{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=0\u0026salableAdamId=896112560\u0026pricingParameters=SWUPD\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=840413794","type":"update","priceFormatted":"$0.00","price":0,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":253568000}]}],"bundleId":"com.kabam.marvelbattle","editorialArtwork":{"originalFlowcaseBrick":{"width":3200,"height":600,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features7/v4/df/a3/fd/dfa3fd03-dd58-032e-b640-c52f8021febb/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"14314d","textColor1":"edeaeb","textColor2":"6baef4","textColor3":"c2c5cb","textColor4":"5a95d2"},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features122/v4/05/cc/c4/05ccc42e-9e91-bd19-faf9-d033b7ccd72f/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"1c212f","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"d89891","textColor3":"b9bec6","textColor4":"b2807e"},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features113/v4/38/ea/13/38ea13ba-6e40-e7b9-b958-27a4f783bde0/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"280446","textColor1":"f2f7fd","textColor2":"b880e8","textColor3":"c9c6d8","textColor4":"9b67c7"},"bannerUber":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features118/v4/ee/83/42/ee8342e4-514b-767c-8dfc-5c8850617835/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"15082f","textColor1":"f8f7fb","textColor2":"d0a2e8","textColor3":"cbc7d2","textColor4":"ab83c3"},"brandLogo":{"width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features113/v4/60/b1/8a/60b18aa7-c189-2365-4c68-df1742342ed0/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor4":"b7b7b7"}},"editorialNotes":{"standard":"Daredevil.
