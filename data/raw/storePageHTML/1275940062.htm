      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>As a HS basketball coach, you always want to have a “drill bank” to pick drills to do during practice. “eCoach” gives you just that and insights from over 25 NBA coaches! <br /><br />This app is one of a kind due to the content from the coaches that are at the top level of basketball and the details that they give during these instructional videos. The videos are no more than 5 minutes that are jammed pack with details that can apply to a youth team all the way up to a college program. <br /><br />Not only do they have drills for teams but they also have individual drills you can do on your own or at a summer workout. “eCoach” also has a couple plays that certain NBA coaches breakdown action by action. (which is very informative) <br /><br />The layout of the app is user friendly and easy to use. The “eCoach” app has all the videos broken down in various categories like “advanced player”, “ball handling” and many more! <br /><br />If you’re a basketball junkie like me, it’s easy to lose track of time learning from the likes of Brad Stevens, Dwane Casey, Stan Van Gundy, and many more!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>If you’re like me, you love basketball. You love everything about the game and are always wanting more. This app provides you with the ability to learn about the game from the top level of coaches. The ones who have made it to the very top of their profession - coaches from the NBA. And it’s easy to watch a video, practice it, then watch the video again due to how quick the lessons are. I can’t really put into words how awesome it is for me to have Brad Stevens teaching me about basketball. I’d definitely say it’s worth giving this app a try.</p>

Please read the following to learn\nmore about our Privacy Policy.\nRemember that your use of eCoach Services is at all times subject to the general Terms of\nUse which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without\ndefining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use.\neCoach Terms of Use can be found at: http://ecoach.coach/\nBy using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept\nthe practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent\nthat we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.\nWhat does this Privacy Policy cover?\nThis Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information\n(\"Personal Information\") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services,\nbut not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t\nmanage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in\nmore detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our\nServices, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set\nup a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to\nfulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the\nServices. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third\nparties, but only as described below.\nAs noted in the Terms of Use, use of our services is not permitted for anyone under the\nage of 13 and we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone\nunder the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services\nor send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected\npersonal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as\nquickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal\ninformation, please contact us at coach@ecoach.coach.\nWill eCoach ever change this Privacy Policy?\nWe’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy\nPolicy from time to time as well, but we will try to alert you to changes by placing a\nnotice on our website, in our app, in our app store information pages, by sending you an\nemail or message through the system (if we have your email and are using this process),\nor by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice\nemails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices\nwill still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and\nunderstanding them. Even if you don’t get or see a notice, if you use the Services after\nany changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the\nchanges. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at\nthe time such information is used.\nWhat Information does eCoach Collect?\nInformation You Provide to Us:\neCoach is a digital software and consumer services company incorporated under the laws\nof the Commonwealth of Kentucky, whose principal place of business is 1999 Richmond\nRoad, Suite 300, Lexington, KY 40502 and its suppliers, licensors, and service providers\n(collectively referred to as “eCoach”). eCoach provides the software tools for coaches to\nenhance their coaching businesses and athletes and parents the tools to gain digital\naccess to coaches.\nIn the category of digital coaching, training, and fitness applications, eCoach aids\nathletes, coaches, and other individuals to interact through various mediums including,\nbut not limited to, video, audio, and text. Almost everything you do when using our\nservices is collected, stored, aggregated, and analyzed by eCoach.\nIn addition to specific information you may input in a Service process (like personal\ninformation, questions, or video), we receive and store any information you knowingly\nprovide to us in using our Services, which could include Personal Information. For\nexample, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may\ncollect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, date of\nbirth, gender, address, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in\ncredentials for Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party\naccount credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or\nservice, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party\nAccount Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize\nsuch transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services\nis covered by this Privacy Policy. Certain information may be required to register with us\nor to take advantage of some of our features. \nWe may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example,\nif you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on\nbehalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may\nreceive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us\nmake our communications with you more interesting and improve our services.\nInformation Collected Automatically:\nWhenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record\ninformation on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP\naddress, device identification, “cookie” information, your location, the time of day, the\ntype of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature\nyou requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow\nus to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in\nour Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the\npreferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s automatic\ncollection of certain information (including the acceptance of cookies), but this may\nprevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.\nIn the future, advertising partners, if any, might also transmit cookies to your browser or\ndevice, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a\nthird party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again,\nthis Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t\nresponsible for their privacy policies and practices.\nWhen we automatically collect the usage information described above, except as part our\nServices, we generally use this data in aggregate form and not in a manner that would\nidentify you personally. For example, this aggregate data can tell us how often users use\na particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services\ninteresting to as many users as possible.\nInformation Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy\nThrough cookies we place on your browser or device, or other identifying information\nprovided by your browser or device, we may collect information about your online\nactivity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect,\nthis information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience,\nand otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser or device may offer you\na “Do Not Track” option or other mechanisms (e.g., mobile device privacy settings)\nwhich allow you to express preferences regarding the collection of such information (e.g.,\nby signaling to operators of websites and online applications and services (including\nbehavioral advertising services and mobile applications) that you do not wish such\noperators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different\nservices). We may share with third parties information about what you watch and other \nactivity, such as viewing history and ratings. In addition, we also may use and share\nyour viewing activity to improve our service or the experience for other users in a way\nthat does not personally identify you to such users.\nOur Services available through a browser do not support Do Not Track requests at this\ntime, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while\nyou are using the Services and after you leave our Services.\nWill eCoach Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?\nYes. We have the right to share and use some of the content and information you submit\nunder our general Terms of Use and Services Agreements which can be found at\nhttp://ecoach.coach/.\nIn addition, we may share certain Personal Information with third parties as described in\nthis section:\nInformation that’s no longer personally identifiable. We may anonymize your\nPersonal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that\ninformation to our partners and the public. This would include your user name if you\nenter one in the profile. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our\npartners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways\npeople use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online\nexperience. However, except as discussed above regarding our Services, we don’t\ndisclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you\npersonally, as an individual.\nAdvertisers: In the future we may choose to allow advertisers and/or merchant partners\n(“Merchant Partners”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their\nadvertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the\ninformation we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to a\nMerchant Partner, in order for that Merchant Partner to select the appropriate audience\nfor those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are\nlocated in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we\nwill not tell such businesses who you are. Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their\nads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage\ninformation to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would\nidentify you personally. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain\naudience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude\nthat you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.\nRelated Businesses and Services: In certain situations, businesses or third party\nwebsites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or \nin connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when\nan affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share\nyour Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related\nto such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to\nautomatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to\nautomatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account.\nWe have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses\nas to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service\nrelating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’\npolicies.\nAgents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need\nto share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example,\nwe may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card\ntransactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use\nthe Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.\nYou should review the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy of each of the partners, tools,\nand resources mentioned by us. We are not responsible for them.\nBusiness Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions,\ncustomer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred.\nAlso, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or\ngo through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets\ntransferred to or acquired by a third party.\nProtection of eCoach and Others: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and\ndisclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order;\nenforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property,\nor safety of eCoach, our employees, our users, or others.\nIs Personal Information about me secure?\nSome of our services may not require passwords and we cannot protect the integrity of\nyour browser, system or computer. You must prevent unauthorized access to your\naccount and Personal Information by appropriately limiting access to your computer or\ndevice and browser.\nWe endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we\nhold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security.\nUnauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may\ncompromise the security of user information at any time.\nWhat Personal Information can I access?\nThrough your account settings or profile page, you may access, and, in some cases, edit\nor delete all profile data.\nThe information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. If\nyou have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you,\nplease contact us at coach@ecoach.coach.\nUnder California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled\nto ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which we share\nwith our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact\ninformation for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and\nwould like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to: coach@ecoach.coach.\nWhat choices do I have?\nYou can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information\nmay be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.\nYou may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you\nupdate information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in\nour records. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such\ninformation from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or\nincorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it.\nFinally, keep in mind that if you choose to turn on the Do Not Track function or other\nsimilar mechanism on your browser or device, we may continue to use all information we\ncollected prior to turning that function off, in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.\nWhat if I have questions about this policy?\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a\ndetailed message to coach@ecoach.coach, and we will try to resolve your concerns.","is32bitOnly":false,"isStandaloneWithCompanionForWatchOS":false,"seller":"eCoach LLC Apps","isSiriSupported":false,"languageList":["English"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"description":{"standard":"The National Basketball Coaches Association’s eCoachBasketball provides access to the world’s best basketball teachers – current and former NBA coaches.

Please read the following to learn\nmore about our Privacy Policy.\nRemember that your use of eCoach Services is at all times subject to the general Terms of\nUse which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without\ndefining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use.\neCoach Terms of Use can be found at: http://ecoach.coach/\nBy using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept\nthe practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent\nthat we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.\nWhat does this Privacy Policy cover?\nThis Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information\n(\"Personal Information\") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services,\nbut not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t\nmanage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in\nmore detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our\nServices, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set\nup a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to\nfulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the\nServices. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third\nparties, but only as described below.\nAs noted in the Terms of Use, use of our services is not permitted for anyone under the\nage of 13 and we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone\nunder the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services\nor send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected\npersonal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as\nquickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal\ninformation, please contact us at coach@ecoach.coach.\nWill eCoach ever change this Privacy Policy?\nWe’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy\nPolicy from time to time as well, but we will try to alert you to changes by placing a\nnotice on our website, in our app, in our app store information pages, by sending you an\nemail or message through the system (if we have your email and are using this process),\nor by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice\nemails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices\nwill still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and\nunderstanding them. Even if you don’t get or see a notice, if you use the Services after\nany changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the\nchanges. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at\nthe time such information is used.\nWhat Information does eCoach Collect?\nInformation You Provide to Us:\neCoach is a digital software and consumer services company incorporated under the laws\nof the Commonwealth of Kentucky, whose principal place of business is 1999 Richmond\nRoad, Suite 300, Lexington, KY 40502 and its suppliers, licensors, and service providers\n(collectively referred to as “eCoach”). eCoach provides the software tools for coaches to\nenhance their coaching businesses and athletes and parents the tools to gain digital\naccess to coaches.\nIn the category of digital coaching, training, and fitness applications, eCoach aids\nathletes, coaches, and other individuals to interact through various mediums including,\nbut not limited to, video, audio, and text. Almost everything you do when using our\nservices is collected, stored, aggregated, and analyzed by eCoach.\nIn addition to specific information you may input in a Service process (like personal\ninformation, questions, or video), we receive and store any information you knowingly\nprovide to us in using our Services, which could include Personal Information. For\nexample, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may\ncollect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, date of\nbirth, gender, address, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in\ncredentials for Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party\naccount credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or\nservice, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party\nAccount Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize\nsuch transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services\nis covered by this Privacy Policy. Certain information may be required to register with us\nor to take advantage of some of our features. \nWe may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example,\nif you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on\nbehalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may\nreceive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us\nmake our communications with you more interesting and improve our services.\nInformation Collected Automatically:\nWhenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record\ninformation on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP\naddress, device identification, “cookie” information, your location, the time of day, the\ntype of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature\nyou requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow\nus to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in\nour Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the\npreferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s automatic\ncollection of certain information (including the acceptance of cookies), but this may\nprevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.\nIn the future, advertising partners, if any, might also transmit cookies to your browser or\ndevice, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a\nthird party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again,\nthis Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t\nresponsible for their privacy policies and practices.\nWhen we automatically collect the usage information described above, except as part our\nServices, we generally use this data in aggregate form and not in a manner that would\nidentify you personally. For example, this aggregate data can tell us how often users use\na particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services\ninteresting to as many users as possible.\nInformation Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy\nThrough cookies we place on your browser or device, or other identifying information\nprovided by your browser or device, we may collect information about your online\nactivity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect,\nthis information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience,\nand otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser or device may offer you\na “Do Not Track” option or other mechanisms (e.g., mobile device privacy settings)\nwhich allow you to express preferences regarding the collection of such information (e.g.,\nby signaling to operators of websites and online applications and services (including\nbehavioral advertising services and mobile applications) that you do not wish such\noperators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different\nservices). We may share with third parties information about what you watch and other \nactivity, such as viewing history and ratings. In addition, we also may use and share\nyour viewing activity to improve our service or the experience for other users in a way\nthat does not personally identify you to such users.\nOur Services available through a browser do not support Do Not Track requests at this\ntime, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while\nyou are using the Services and after you leave our Services.\nWill eCoach Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?\nYes. We have the right to share and use some of the content and information you submit\nunder our general Terms of Use and Services Agreements which can be found at\nhttp://ecoach.coach/.\nIn addition, we may share certain Personal Information with third parties as described in\nthis section:\nInformation that’s no longer personally identifiable. We may anonymize your\nPersonal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that\ninformation to our partners and the public. This would include your user name if you\nenter one in the profile. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our\npartners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways\npeople use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online\nexperience. However, except as discussed above regarding our Services, we don’t\ndisclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you\npersonally, as an individual.\nAdvertisers: In the future we may choose to allow advertisers and/or merchant partners\n(“Merchant Partners”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their\nadvertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the\ninformation we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to a\nMerchant Partner, in order for that Merchant Partner to select the appropriate audience\nfor those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are\nlocated in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we\nwill not tell such businesses who you are. Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their\nads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage\ninformation to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would\nidentify you personally. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain\naudience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude\nthat you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.\nRelated Businesses and Services: In certain situations, businesses or third party\nwebsites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or \nin connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when\nan affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share\nyour Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related\nto such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to\nautomatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to\nautomatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account.\nWe have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses\nas to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service\nrelating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’\npolicies.\nAgents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need\nto share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example,\nwe may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card\ntransactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use\nthe Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.\nYou should review the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy of each of the partners, tools,\nand resources mentioned by us. We are not responsible for them.\nBusiness Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions,\ncustomer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred.\nAlso, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or\ngo through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets\ntransferred to or acquired by a third party.\nProtection of eCoach and Others: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and\ndisclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order;\nenforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property,\nor safety of eCoach, our employees, our users, or others.\nIs Personal Information about me secure?\nSome of our services may not require passwords and we cannot protect the integrity of\nyour browser, system or computer.

The videos are no more than 5 minutes that are jammed pack with details that can apply to a youth team all the way up to a college program. \n\nNot only do they have drills for teams but they also have individual drills you can do on your own or at a summer workout. “eCoach” also has a couple plays that certain NBA coaches breakdown action by action. (which is very informative) \n\nThe layout of the app is user friendly and easy to use. The “eCoach” app has all the videos broken down in various categories like “advanced player”, “ball handling” and many more! \n\nIf you’re a basketball junkie like me, it’s easy to lose track of time learning from the likes of Brad Stevens, Dwane Casey, Stan Van Gundy, and many more!","title":"This app will take your program to the Next Level!","userName":"Marksberry12"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2054555004","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-01-04T00:52:47Z","rating":5,"review":"If you’re like me, you love basketball.
