      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Introducing Joe Martinez - BallparkDJ is excited to welcome Joe Martinez to our talented roster of announcers.  Joe is best known as a ring announcer for UFC and Golden Boy Boxing events.  Joe has an exciting energetic style of his own and we think your team will love the way he introduces your players.<br /><br />Music Finish Sound Effect - A new option was added in the Edit Music screen titled “Music Finish Sound Effect”.  This was added primarily as a “Fade Out” alternative but can provide a dramatic finish to any introduction.  Fade Out can be problematic for some combinations of Apple Music and Bluetooth speakers because we have to adjust the volume of the device to fade out and this results in beeping on some Bluetooth speakers.  The new Music Finish Sound Effect provides a great alternative and a dramatic ending and masks the sudden stopping of the song (without fade out).  Additionally, the sound effect may be repeated as many times as the user wishes, resulting in an echo/reverb effect.  The Fade Out option has also been moved from the Edit Player window to the Edit Music window.  When Music Finish is turned on, it’s recommended that the Fade Out is turned off.  Try the “Whoosh” effect repeating 3 times.<br /><br />Volume Adjustment Improvements - Improvements were made in the area of volume management and volume adjustment.  Certain combinations of clicks were resulting in the volume unexpectedly being lowered.  This has been corrected.<br /><br />Apple Music and iOS 14 - Improvements were made in order to fully support Apple Music and team sharing and Song Assistant with Apple Music.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>We bought this app for our eight-year-old baseball travel team. The boys absolutely loved it. They chose different music from iTunes for their walk on songs and had so much fun. The best part though is definitely having the professional announcer say the boys numbers and names. Although this is about three dollars extra per Player it is totally worth it! It makes it so much more professional. The app is easy to use and I absolutely love it. We sync with a Bluetooth speaker at any of the parks that we go to. The only improvement I wish is that it would be nice to be able to slide the players up and down in the lineup for when there are lineup changes but this is minor since you can work around it with a few extra clicks. Love this app!<br /><br />We have been using this app for over a year and it has gotten even better! Now you can slide the lineup around under the edit function, can add just a few additional players for voicing (when kids join the team or guest play), voicing turnaround time is fantastic and with the iPad update we use that so any mom at the game can run it rather than just though my phone...just keeps getting better!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been using this app for about 2 years now for travel baseball. Recently, I decided to purchase the voiceover for the intros and I was not disappointed. The quality is unquestionable and it’s great that it comes from a MLB stadium announcer. When I tried it myself, my voice sounded like a dying wildebeest and there was no way I was going that route. <br /><br />The app is very simple to use and I love how you can overlap the announcer/music and control the song to exactly your liking. It quickly displays your music already on your device, with various ways to organize songs. <br /><br />I recommend this to any coach out there, as the kids love hearing their names out loud followed by their favorite song. In the two years of using this, not once has it crashed or suffered from ‘bugs’.  <br /><br />More importantly I wanted to stress the unbelievable service I received from the developer and Mr. Motter. I purchased 13 voice intros roughly 3 days ago and just noticed hours before game time I put the wrong number on a player. I emailed my issue expecting at least a couple of days to get it fixed, but they fixed it within the hour! Casey Motter even followed up to ensure the accuracy, you don’t get that service in these times. I can’t thank you guys enough and I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone. Money well spent! <br /><br />Thanks Again,<br />Go Nats!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I purchased this not sure how well it was going to be. I had purchased a different one and it wasn’t what I thought it was going to be at all. This app is so easy to navigate. Chad is very easy to work with and you can tell he really cares about the consumer and will go out of his way to make it work. I contacted him last minute needing 2 new players added. There were some technical issues on his end and he sent me his personal number and asked me to call him and we would get it set up. He went above and beyond. I suggest getting the team intro. Everyone in the stands went wild when I played it. I had other teams asking me what app I was using because it sounded so good and professional. The boys loved hearing their name and the song of their choice as they walked up to the plate. Will use again and again. Thank you Chad!</p>

Joe Martinez - BallparkDJ is excited to welcome Joe Martinez to our talented roster of announcers.  Joe is best known as a ring announcer for UFC and Golden Boy Boxing events.  Joe has an exciting energetic style of his own and we think your team will love the way he introduces your players.\n\nMusic Finish Sound Effect - A new option was added in the Edit Music screen titled “Music Finish Sound Effect”.  This was added primarily as a “Fade Out” alternative but can provide a dramatic finish to any introduction.  Fade Out can be problematic for some combinations of Apple Music and Bluetooth speakers because we have to adjust the volume of the device to fade out and this results in beeping on some Bluetooth speakers.  The new Music Finish Sound Effect provides a great alternative and a dramatic ending and masks the sudden stopping of the song (without fade out).  Additionally, the sound effect may be repeated as many times as the user wishes, resulting in an echo/reverb effect.  The Fade Out option has also been moved from the Edit Player window to the Edit Music window.  When Music Finish is turned on, it’s recommended that the Fade Out is turned off.  Try the “Whoosh” effect repeating 3 times.\n\nVolume Adjustment Improvements - Improvements were made in the area of volume management and volume adjustment.

The boys absolutely loved it. They chose different music from iTunes for their walk on songs and had so much fun. The best part though is definitely having the professional announcer say the boys numbers and names. Although this is about three dollars extra per Player it is totally worth it! It makes it so much more professional. The app is easy to use and I absolutely love it. We sync with a Bluetooth speaker at any of the parks that we go to. The only improvement I wish is that it would be nice to be able to slide the players up and down in the lineup for when there are lineup changes but this is minor since you can work around it with a few extra clicks. Love this app!\n\nWe have been using this app for over a year and it has gotten even better! Now you can slide the lineup around under the edit function, can add just a few additional players for voicing (when kids join the team or guest play), voicing turnaround time is fantastic and with the iPad update we use that so any mom at the game can run it rather than just though my phone...just keeps getting better!","title":"Great product","userName":"TampabaseballMom"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1880226409","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2017-10-28T05:55:14Z","rating":5,"review":"I have been using this app for about 2 years now for travel baseball.

When I tried it myself, my voice sounded like a dying wildebeest and there was no way I was going that route. \n\nThe app is very simple to use and I love how you can overlap the announcer/music and control the song to exactly your liking. It quickly displays your music already on your device, with various ways to organize songs. \n\nI recommend this to any coach out there, as the kids love hearing their names out loud followed by their favorite song. In the two years of using this, not once has it crashed or suffered from ‘bugs’.  \n\nMore importantly I wanted to stress the unbelievable service I received from the developer and Mr. Motter. I purchased 13 voice intros roughly 3 days ago and just noticed hours before game time I put the wrong number on a player. I emailed my issue expecting at least a couple of days to get it fixed, but they fixed it within the hour! Casey Motter even followed up to ensure the accuracy, you don’t get that service in these times. I can’t thank you guys enough and I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone. Money well spent! \n\nThanks Again,\nGo Nats!","title":"Perfect App, even better customer service","userName":"Grissom09"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2935549455","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-07-19T18:01:08Z","rating":5,"review":"I purchased this not sure how well it was going to be. I had purchased a different one and it wasn’t what I thought it was going to be at all. This app is so easy to navigate. Chad is very easy to work with and you can tell he really cares about the consumer and will go out of his way to make it work. I contacted him last minute needing 2 new players added. There were some technical issues on his end and he sent me his personal number and asked me to call him and we would get it set up. He went above and beyond. I suggest getting the team intro. Everyone in the stands went wild when I played it. I had other teams asking me what app I was using because it sounded so good and professional. The boys loved hearing their name and the song of their choice as they walked up to the plate. Will use again and again.

That’s how incredible this app is! If you’re reading this and trying to determine which app to get for your team’s walk-up music, stop reading and get this app now!\n\nThis app is so user friendly, so intuitive, SO SIMPLE to set-up, you’d think it wouldn’t meet ALL of your needs, BUT IT DOES. I started by using my own voice to announce the players and it was easy to do and honestly sounded great. Being able to very easily edit where you want the song to start and exactly where you want the players name to be announced was great as well. \n\nBut being able to add the actual voice of the Braves announcer for each kid made this app jump into the “pro” category! Others have commented on this as well, but the turn-around time to get the recordings back was just THREE HOURS!!! That kind of customer service simply doesn’t exist anymore. Thank you Casey Motter!!! (Atlanta Braves announcer) And thank you app developers! \n\nI do not know the developers or anyone associated with them or Casey Motter. This is a genuine Golden 5-Star recommendation for this app. Well done guys, and again, thank you!","title":"this is the only app you need","userName":"KevinBurdette"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6207315116","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-17T03:52:34Z","developerResponse":{"id":17831271,"body":"Laura, thanks for the kind words.

I purchased the premium package, which is very reasonably priced, and Johnny created the most awesome announcing experience I have ever heard. I think that every possible scenario is covered. It truly sounds like we have a professional announcer at every game calling all of the plays. The kids (and their parents) absolutely love it. I would highly, highly recommend this program. For a few extra dollars, get the premium package and have Johnny set it all up for you. I’m so glad I did. He is awesome!  It is so much better than I could ever dream, and simple to use. You will not be disappointed.  Teams approach me at every tournament and ask where I got it.

We could not be happier! \n\nRecently I had to get a new iPhone and wasn’t able to share my existing team with the new phone due to a virus not letting me access it which made me think I lost all my intros and recording..

Joe is best known as a ring announcer for UFC and Golden Boy Boxing events.  Joe has an exciting energetic style of his own and we think your team will love the way he introduces your players.\n\nMusic Finish Sound Effect - A new option was added in the Edit Music screen titled “Music Finish Sound Effect”.  This was added primarily as a “Fade Out” alternative but can provide a dramatic finish to any introduction.  Fade Out can be problematic for some combinations of Apple Music and Bluetooth speakers because we have to adjust the volume of the device to fade out and this results in beeping on some Bluetooth speakers.  The new Music Finish Sound Effect provides a great alternative and a dramatic ending and masks the sudden stopping of the song (without fade out).  Additionally, the sound effect may be repeated as many times as the user wishes, resulting in an echo/reverb effect.  The Fade Out option has also been moved from the Edit Player window to the Edit Music window.  When Music Finish is turned on, it’s recommended that the Fade Out is turned off.  Try the “Whoosh” effect repeating 3 times.\n\nVolume Adjustment Improvements - Improvements were made in the area of volume management and volume adjustment.  Certain combinations of clicks were resulting in the volume unexpectedly being lowered.  This has been corrected.\n\nApple Music and iOS 14 - Improvements were made in order to fully support Apple Music and team sharing and Song Assistant with Apple Music.","releaseDate":"2021-03-09"},{"versionDisplay":"10.1","releaseNotes":"Fixed outstanding iPad crashes.\nMinor bug fixes and improvements.\n\n--------------\n\n- More Levels of Relative Volume - The Relative Volume slider that controls the volume of the music relative to voice now offers 9 different levels.

The Relative Volume slider can be found in the Edit Player window and is only visible when both music and voice are involved.\n\n- Share Team via Text Message / Other - When sharing a team from the Actions menu, users now have 3 options: Text Message, Email, and Other.  In previous versions, sharing was only available via Email.  Now users can share through Text Message or may choose the Other option which opens up many other methods including Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Messenger and much more.\n\n- SuperVoice Team Colors - SuperVoice teams are now color coded to help clearly identify which team is the Master, the Pre-Game Intros, and the SuperVoice team.  You will only see the colored teams if you have ordered SuperVoice.  The Master team is the one you originally ordered SuperVoice from and the one you should use to add or redo players.  The Master team is colored blue, the pre-game intro team is colored red, and the SuperVoice team is colored gold.  If you see a team colored green, that is a team that BallparkDJ created and shared such as Sound Effects of Seasons Greeting teams.\n\n- Longer Song Duration - In previous versions, the song duration was limited to a maximum of 60 seconds.
