      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This has a lot of variety in content. The problem is that it’s really hard to find what you want. There is no search function. While there are categories, they aren’t organized, not even alphabetically within a category. And there is no watch list so you can’t find and tag something to watch later. Also categories aren’t consistent between the iPad app and the Apple TV app. I found something on one that I couldn’t find on the other. If you don’t mind searching A LOT, you’ll find some fun nostalgic content.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I wanted to watch the horror found footage film called vhs and vhs 2 but the vhs 2 was strange.  It had all the audio EXCEPT for human voices throughout the movie. I even forwarded to multiple scenes but still the same result.  Just people’s mouths are moving only.  I watched the same scene in an official trailer and it does have audio for human voices. I don’t know what but it’s just something that Popcornflix messed up on and needs to get it fixed ASAP.<br /><br />Also the ads are WAAAAAY too long and too frequent.  Every 10 to 15 minutes, I get 2 ads which are 30 seconds long each.  Sometimes even 40 seconds and the other 30 seconds.  If I’m lucky I get 1 ad which is just 5 seconds and the other 30 seconds but this is rare.  It just destroys the mood of the movie.  Even if it’s free, I’m considering deleting this app due to its heavy repetitive ad system.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love how many movie choices there are , even if I haven&#39;t heard of most of the titles .<br /> What makes this app almost worthless , is how long it takes for an add to finally buffer so it plays . The movies them selves play seamlessly . But man the ads take for ever to play and they play much like a broken record . I can sit through a minute and a half of ads a few times through the film . No problem . But it takes as long as five minutes for even one of them to play . <br /> I thought it was my internet connection but my other free movie apps don&#39;t have the same issues . <br /> This app would be ideal, if not for that .<br /> I hope it gets worked out because this could be a great experience for movie lovers .</p>

Web beacons can be very small or invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page or email, including HTML-based content, can act as a Web beacon. We may use Web beacons to count visitors to our Web pages or to monitor how our users navigate our Sites, and we may include Web beacons in email messages in order to count how many of the messages we sent were actually opened or acted upon.

For example, you may see reCAPTCHA when you register for a new account, request to reset your password, or submit a contact form message. In order to determine whether a user is a human or a spam robot, the reCAPTCHA service collects hardware and software information, such as device and application data, which is then sent to Google for analysis. reCAPTCHA also creates and sets cookies. As stated by the reCAPTCHA API Terms of Service, the information collected in connection with use of the reCAPTCHA service will be used for improving reCAPTCHA and for general security purposes, and information collected for reCAPTCHA will not be used for personalized advertising by Google.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at the email address or mailing address in the “Questions about our Privacy Policy” section below.\n \nHow Long We Will Hold Information\nWe will hold information about you on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant services, as long as your account is active, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with CSS, subject to any applicable laws and/or regulations, or to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. In the case that you wish to cancel your registration as a member of any of our Sites, once an account is deleted, we will not use the information about you other than for administrative purposes. Nonetheless, it stays on the system for a period of one year for administration purposes before being deleted.\nWhere you contribute to the Sites, we will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted. See User Generated Content below.\n \nUser Generated Content\nCertain portions of our Services permit users to post content in contexts that do not have a restricted audience, including, for example, profile pages, discussion forum messages, blogs, commenting on an article, posting a picture, etc. Any information that you post using these features to our Services may be viewable by other visitors to our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy of your submissions, or for the accuracy of any information contained in those submissions. Any information that you disclose becomes public information.

Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site and other websites you have visited. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.

Further information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country of residence within the EU. You can exercise any of these rights by contacting us through our email or mailing address in the “Questions about our Privacy Policy” section below:\nThe right to be informed. You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your information and your rights. This is why we’re providing you with the information in this Policy.\n \nThe right of access. You have the right to obtain access to your information, and certain other information (similar to that provided in this Privacy Policy). This is so you’re aware and can check that we’re using your information in accordance with data protection law.\n \nThe right to rectification. You are entitled to have your information corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.\n \nThe right to erasure. This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your information where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions.\n \nThe right to restrict processing. You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in future.\n \nThe right to data portability. You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services. For example, if you decide to switch to a new provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your information easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without affecting its usability. This is not a general right however and there are exceptions.\n \nThe right to object to processing. You have the right to object to certain types of processing, including processing for direct marketing (i.e. receiving emails from us notifying you about other services we provide which we think may be of interest to you or being contacted with varying potential opportunities). You may change your preferences regarding email or newsletters as described above.\n \nThe right to lodge a complaint. You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your personal data with your national data protection regulator.\n \nThe right to withdraw consent. If you have given your consent to anything we do with your personal data (i.e we rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal information), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that anything we have done with your personal data with your consent up to that point is unlawful). You can withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal information at any time.\n \nYour California Privacy Rights\nWe may disclose your information to Crackle Inc. and its affiliates, subject to the terms of the agreements that created our joint venture, Crackle Plus, for as long as Crackle Inc. owns any interest in the joint venture. Crackle Inc. and its affiliates may use your information for any lawful commercial purposes, including marketing and advertising.\nOther than sharing your information with Crackle Inc., as described above, we will only knowingly share your information with non-affiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes if you specifically opt-in, or are offered the opportunity to opt-out and elect not to opt-out, to such sharing at the time you provide personal information. If you do not opt-in or if you opt-out at that time, we will not knowingly share the information that was collected, but we may continue to seek your consent to sharing with the same or other non-affiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes from time to time. Each consent notice and opportunity will be treated separately so it is possible that you may consent to some sharing but not to others.\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) affords the Californian consumer specific rights regarding personal information. These rights have been described in this policy overall and are further highlighted in this section. If you have a specific question or concern about your rights, or questions about our policy in support of your rights as a Californian consumer, please contact us through our email or mailing address in the “Questions about our Privacy Policy” section below.\nWhat is Personal Information under the CCPA?\n“Personal information” is anything that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.\nYour Rights with regard to your Personal Information:\nYou have the right as a Californian consumer to expect disclosures as to how we collect, use and care for personal data and whether we, for our benefit or on behalf of another company, share or sell the personal information we collect or process for commercial gain. We have provided these disclosures in the above sections of our Privacy Notice.\nFurther, you have the right as a Californian consumer to expect the policy to be available, accessible and easy to understand, and reviewed and updated at least annually describing our personal information collection activities over the prior 12 months. If our business changes or additional processing for new purposes are planned, you have the right to expect an update to the privacy policy to be provided describing these purposes. You can continue to expect us to disclose how we collect personal information and the sources from which we may obtain that information, and the specific personal information or categories of information that we have collected. You have a right to the disclosure of the business or commercial purposes we have for collecting or selling personal information, the legal basis on which we do so, disclosure of the categories of personal information that have been sold, transferred, shared or disclosed in the preceding 12-month period for commercial purposes, and the categories of recipients to which that personal information has been disclosed, shared, transferred or sold. The CCPA requires opt in consent to data use for minors under the age of 16 and verified parental consent for children under the age of 13. If notified that children have provided data without appropriate process and consent, it will be deleted as immediately as practicable on advisement. Lastly, you have the right to ask what information we have about you specifically.\nYou may exercise these rights without concern. You cannot be denied benefits or services or charged differently for doing so. We, or our partners, on verification of your identity and legitimate standing to make the request, and if not an undue or unreasonable hardship for the company, shall act on your request, or at a very minimum, advise you as to why we cannot. There are specific reasons under the law which prevent accommodation of some requests, but if denied, we will advise as to why, to whom you may submit a complaint, and your options for challenge, redress or escalation.\nYou may make a verifiable request to exercise the following rights, free of charge to you, twice in a 12-month period, and we are obligated to respond within a period of 45 days:\nAccess: You have the right to request disclosure of the personal information we hold, and to receive additional details regarding the personal information the business collects and its use purposes, including any third parties with which it shares information. Much of this information is presented in the above sections of the Privacy Notice, as well.\nDelete: You have the right to request that we erase your personal information and for us to direct the same of any third-party service providers processing your data on our behalf.\nPortability: Request that any information electronically held be returned in a format permitting its transfer to another service.\nWE DO NOT SELL, DISCLOSE, SHARE OR TRANSFER DATA FOR THE COMMERCIAL BENEFIT OF ANY PARTY. PERSONAL DATA OR THE BENEFIT OF ITS USE IS NEVER PROVIDED IN COMPENSATION FOR SERVICES.\nThat does not mean that we do not share your data with other parties, but, as described in the above sections of the Privacy Notice, any disclosure of data is solely performed for the operation of the site and provision of services.\nIf you would like to submit a complaint about our use of your personal information or our response or handling of your requests regarding your personal information, you may contact us as described above.\nFor more information on the California Consumer Privacy Act please visit https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\n \nOther Sites and Services\nCSS may contain links to, or advertisements about, non-CSS websites.
