      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Slacker Radio is the answer to Pandora’s increasingly bad service. Like Pandora, Slacker Radio allows you to create custom radio stations with the ability to tell the station that you either like the current playing song or that you never want to play the current playing song again. However, Slacker Radio is better at this kind of service because it allows you to listen to original recordings that are not censored and it has better quality audio. I have tried Pandora and even paid a monthly subscription, but Pandora does not play original uncensored recordings despite the fact that I turned on explicit content. Perhaps some priggish Pandora users somehow caused Pandora to ban all explicit content? Or perhaps Pandora’s algorithm is mistakingly interpreting that I somehow don’t like explicit content, despite the fact that I turned on explicit content? I’m happy that Slacker does not have this problem and that it plays original uncensored music with high quality sound. Thanks for the great music, Slacker Radio, and keep the free-spirited uncensored music going—unhindered by the moralism that has apparently infected Pandora.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love Slacker. I actually used it religiously about 10 years ago. It has always done a great job of mixing old and new with my custom stations. I left Slacker long ago when they made all the huge interface changes. I subscribed to Pandora and never really looked back. <br /><br />Fast forward to this week. I decide to see what’s going on with Slacker. Plus I wanted to see if my old stations had any gems I forgot about. I downloaded the app and connected it to my car stereo. The first thing I noticed was the sound quality was way better. Everything sounded more full than my pandora music. 2nd is that unlike pandora, my phone didn’t got into “accessory mode” making it hard to control it the way I want. 3rd was the interface looks great! Much better than the old blue colors of pandora. My only thing with it is why is it so hard to get to my custom stations? I couldn’t care less about the premade stations, I want to see a list of mine the moment I open the app. Instead I have to go to my music, then scroll around until I find custom stations. It should either be there from the get go or one tap away. Another bonus that I never thought I would like... djs and little snippets of news in between songs. They are short and informative and really make it feel like a premium radio station. Remember the old XM radio? It’s similar to that. Now XM has mindless bla bla bla in between songs. This is different and they nailed it.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love Slacker. It’s awesome for those of us who don’t follow artists and want help listening to the latest content through their curated channels.  <br />That being said, Slacker has done such a poor job in marketing itself and attempting to acquire a loyal base of paid subscribers to assure its long term survival.  The idea to cross market with Dash Radio seems short sighted given it’s a gratis product, but the least you could do for subscribers is to offer higher bitrate streams because the audio quality is lacking.  <br />Other than this I can’t say enough good about Slacker and send everyone I know to the platform and encourage them to subscribe to at least the low-tier subscription as it’s an excellent value.<br />Lastly:  Chromecast streaming is broken after iOS 12 and needs to be fixed.</p>

Like Pandora, Slacker Radio allows you to create custom radio stations with the ability to tell the station that you either like the current playing song or that you never want to play the current playing song again. However, Slacker Radio is better at this kind of service because it allows you to listen to original recordings that are not censored and it has better quality audio. I have tried Pandora and even paid a monthly subscription, but Pandora does not play original uncensored recordings despite the fact that I turned on explicit content. Perhaps some priggish Pandora users somehow caused Pandora to ban all explicit content? Or perhaps Pandora’s algorithm is mistakingly interpreting that I somehow don’t like explicit content, despite the fact that I turned on explicit content? I’m happy that Slacker does not have this problem and that it plays original uncensored music with high quality sound. Thanks for the great music, Slacker Radio, and keep the free-spirited uncensored music going—unhindered by the moralism that has apparently infected Pandora.","title":"Better than Pandora","userName":"Brent Willingham"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3819170162","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-02-27T03:58:23Z","rating":4,"review":"I love Slacker. I actually used it religiously about 10 years ago. It has always done a great job of mixing old and new with my custom stations. I left Slacker long ago when they made all the huge interface changes. I subscribed to Pandora and never really looked back. \n\nFast forward to this week. I decide to see what’s going on with Slacker. Plus I wanted to see if my old stations had any gems I forgot about. I downloaded the app and connected it to my car stereo. The first thing I noticed was the sound quality was way better. Everything sounded more full than my pandora music. 2nd is that unlike pandora, my phone didn’t got into “accessory mode” making it hard to control it the way I want. 3rd was the interface looks great! Much better than the old blue colors of pandora. My only thing with it is why is it so hard to get to my custom stations? I couldn’t care less about the premade stations, I want to see a list of mine the moment I open the app. Instead I have to go to my music, then scroll around until I find custom stations. It should either be there from the get go or one tap away. Another bonus that I never thought I would like... djs and little snippets of news in between songs. They are short and informative and really make it feel like a premium radio station. Remember the old XM radio? It’s similar to that. Now XM has mindless bla bla bla in between songs. This is different and they nailed it.","title":"So close to perfection.","userName":"LLoose494"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3351178774","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-10-27T20:25:59Z","rating":5,"review":"I love Slacker. It’s awesome for those of us who don’t follow artists and want help listening to the latest content through their curated channels.  \nThat being said, Slacker has done such a poor job in marketing itself and attempting to acquire a loyal base of paid subscribers to assure its long term survival.  The idea to cross market with Dash Radio seems short sighted given it’s a gratis product, but the least you could do for subscribers is to offer higher bitrate streams because the audio quality is lacking.  \nOther than this I can’t say enough good about Slacker and send everyone I know to the platform and encourage them to subscribe to at least the low-tier subscription as it’s an excellent value.\nLastly:  Chromecast streaming is broken after iOS 12 and needs to be fixed.","title":"Improve Dash audio quality","userName":"LAX20531"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2051297891","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-01-02T22:25:47Z","rating":2,"review":"Like many, I left Pandora a few years ago in search of something better. I was tired of listening to the same old things, the price just to remove ads, and those limited skips. I finally found Slacker, 3.99 a month for Plus subscription, featuring unlimited skips, no ads, and the BEST thing was offline listening for work travel or when reception was poor. It wasn’t uncommon to have minor issues with the app, but those were mostly just mildly annoying and often times addressed in the next update. Today I go to listen to my offline playlist as usual and was given a notification that I would have to upgrade to a Premium subscription to enjoy offline listening. What?? I did a bit of digging and realized that the Plus subscription has removed offline listening from its list of perks. Really?? It’s worse that I wasn’t even given a warning or a quick email/notification. They just changed it. $4 a month was the perfect sweet spot for what I got, but I don’t think it’s worth $10 per month. I find myself a bit distrustful of the way they went about it. I wouldn’t have been terribly upset if they increased their rate $1-2 per month with notice but to jump $6 a month? No way. Now I get to start doing some research again into switching music apps.","title":"Loss of Offline Listening in Plus","userName":"Berlynn88"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4064959181","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-04-27T01:37:08Z","rating":2,"review":"Slacker was better when it was slacker the overhaul LiveXLive did of the app is hard to navigate.

Time to judge and being honest. Before I start my paid membership today on the radio plus, I paid enough attention to other feedbacks and I realized something important which once upon a time used to be available with this radio plus has been canceled and categorized in a highest level of membership with $9.99 and I bought my membership with full acknowledgment about this in particular but for what I experienced with this app, I didn’t expect anything worse and surprisingly right now and even before a whole day membership I just canceled the automatic payment and end of the story. I really have no idea what the designers of this app are thinking about but obviously they have forgotten that people are comparing similar service apps together and this one which supposed to be no advertise and pure music is everything but what it says it is. Anyway I am more comfortable to get back to my iHeartRadio or even Tunein radio with almost the same amount of monthly payments and don’t trick myself with something that is not even close to be a two stars app in my evaluation.\nSorry that I had to be honest but that’s all I had to say.","title":"Worst Radio App Ever","userName":"Jay9739"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4055834616","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-04-24T23:32:32Z","rating":4,"review":"I have been a paid Slacker subscriber for many years...but I’m a bit disappointed with the look of the new app LiveXLive.\nNew app should mean NEW cover art for ALL the stations.

I never had a problem until now, and 3 months ago I would have given it an easy 5 star rating.
