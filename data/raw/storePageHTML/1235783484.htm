      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I purchased PokerGO to watch the content which I greatly enjoy. I bought on my AppleTV. It shows up in my purchases in my App Store subscriptions, however it won’t let me restore purchases successfully from my iPad, so I can’t watch on other devices. It also doesn’t allow me to figure out my password or reset it from my iPad. Since I’m now away from my Apple TV for a while, this subscription is useless to me. Will ask for a refund unless someone can help address this issue with me. <br /><br />Great content is there, but it’s such a pain to use, I’ll just find other poker content elsewhere.<br /><br />UPDATE - PokerGO contacted me and I was able to resolve the issue. The AppleTV signup didn’t require a password and I needed to reset the password to play on the iPad. The App still is not perfect (hard to surf), but the content is excellent and they honestly tried to help. Give it a try.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>First my title should remove anyone’s fears about bad reviews (just look at their dates and if they are 2017/early 2018 ignore them). PokerGo is an AMAZING platform for the casual fan and especially a poker fiend and player like me! I too had ONE huge issue when I first subscribed and that was the casting engine in particular. Quite frankly it just didn’t work well and sometimes not at all! I voiced my complaints and PG have gone above and beyond what a normal company usually would do. Not only did I receive credit for a month of service because of not being able to stream but they TRULY listened to my issues, relayed them to their tech support team and now a month away from my one year of being a subscriber have fixed EVERYTHING!! Next is the content. Sure in it’s infancy the ORIGINAL content was a little lacking. Not anymore. It’s great. Poker After Dark is back!! 100+ days of live stream (events you would NEVER see) if not for PG in full HD are great!! No commercials and unedited commentary (love it). I believe they are even giving a month free trial during the WSOP summer! After that 10 clams a month! I will be a subscriber for as long as I am a poker fan and player!! Simply great app hands down!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I think many of the PokerGo streaming community and myself would love to see some improvements soon.<br /><br />Although the visual aspects of the app are pleasing (as is the PokerGo studio), there needs to be a fix with the app. Scrubbing and no auto-save for sometimes an 8hr clip is extremely annoying. I wish I could stream these events on Twitch instead to have a chat room, but of course if PokerGo would not be able to provide this live, rather in 8hr clips that do not save where you left off...<br /><br />Anyways, I had some problems with this app last year, happily I subscribed for the last 11 months but unfortunately re subscribing to watch this seasons poker events. Would LOVE for a software update!! See your other customers reviews as well!!!</p>

This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) governs the use of your Personal Data (as defined below) in connection with any websites, mobile websites, online video services, applications (e.g., iPhone applications, iPad applications, Android applications, etc.) or other online services owned or operated by Poker Central® LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Poker Central,” “we” or “us”), including, without limitation, the website currently located at www.pokergo.com and any mobile version of the website (collectively, the “Site”), the PokerGO® subscription product (“PokerGO”) offered by Poker Central, any other interactive features, widgets, products and resources offered by Poker Central and/or its affiliates, distributors or licensees through traditional Internet websites, mobile devices or other platforms, and all other content included within the Site and accessible via any applications (all of which are collectively referred to as the “Services”). This Privacy Policy also explains your choices for managing your information preferences, including opting out of certain uses of your Personal Data.\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANAGING YOUR INFORMATION PREFERENCES\r\nThird Party/Affiliate Sharing\r\nIf we are authorized or permitted to share your Personal Data with third parties or our affiliates for their direct marketing purposes but you would like to opt out, you may do so by sending us an email at pc-optout@pokercentral.com.

Alternatively, you may email pc-optout@pokercentral.com at any time and ask to be removed. We may continue to send you certain transaction email communications (e.g., emails regarding account notifications, customer support questions and similar information regarding your use of the Site and Services). We process this Personal Data for our legitimate interests of sending direct marketing to you.\r\n\r\n\nYour Legal Rights\r\nIf you would like to request a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you, you may do so by emailing customerservice@pokergo.com.\r\n\r\n\nIf you believe that any information we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request that we correct or delete the inaccurate information by emailing customerservice@pokergo.com.\r\n\r\n\nYou may object to having your Personal Data processed by emailing customerservice@pokergo.com.\r\n\r\n\nYou may request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances by emailing customerservice@pokergo.com.\r\n\nYou may request that we delete all Personal Data we hold about you by emailing customerservice@pokergo.com.\r\n\r\n\nYou may request the transfer of your Personal Data to you or to a third party in certain circumstances by emailing customerservice@pokergo.com.\r\n\r\n\nSimilarly, for all other questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy, you may email customerservice@pokergo.com.\r\n\r\n\nINFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT\r\nPersonal Data\r\nWe collect information that you choose to provide us or that you choose to include in your Poker Central or PokerGO profile or account, and that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, zip code, telephone number, e-mail address, and other personally identifiable information (“Personal Data”). You may be asked to provide us with Personal Data when you register with the Site and at other times to enable us to provide the Site and Services to you, to ensure the security and operation of the Site and to manage our relationship with you. As authorized by you (opt-in consent) or permitted by law, we and our affiliates may process this Personal Data (i) to directly market products and services that may be of interest to you, (ii) to perform any contract with you or for taking steps at your request with a view to entering into a contract with you, (iii) to comply with legal obligations (e.g., to inform you of changes to the Site, our Terms of Use and/or this Privacy Policy), and (iv) in connection with our legitimate interests for running and growing our business, including, without limitation, providing and administering IT services and network security, preventing fraud, and in the context of a business reorganization or group restructuring. Your decision to provide this information is optional. However, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Site or Services.\r\n\r\n\nUsage Data and Site Activity\r\nWe automatically collect information in connection with the actions you take on the Site and in connection with using the Services through the use of cookies, server logs, and other technologies (“Usage Data”) to improve the Site, Services and user experience, to build an understanding of the functionality, services and products of interest to you, to share with third party analytics providers, advertising networks and search information providers, and to administer and protect our business and the Site including troubleshooting, data analytics, testing, system maintenance, support, reporting and hosting of data. For example, each time you use the Site we automatically collect the type of web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the Site. This anonymous usage information may be associated with your username and profile, but we do not disclose the associated information to third parties. Our processing of Usage Data is necessary: (i) to perform any contract with you, (ii) for our legitimate interests of running and growing our business, including, without limitation, providing and administering of IT services and network security, preventing fraud, and in the context of a business reorganization or group restructuring, (iii) for our legitimate interest of ensuring registered users are informed of the functionality, advertising, products and services relevant to them, which in turn improves our Service, and (iv) to comply with any legal obligations. Your Personal Data and Usage Data may be used for profiling purposes, the consequences of which are that you may be placed in a group based on some or all of your Personal Data and/or Usage Data for the purposes of direct marketing and/or our development and implementation of advertising strategies.\r\n\nCookies and Web Beacons\r\nWe may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser). We also may use web beacons (an electronic file placed on a website that monitors usage). We use cookies and web beacons to improve the experience of the Site and Services, such as pre-populating your username for easier login. We do not use cookies or web beacons to collect Personal Data. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Site or Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Some of our Third-Party Providers and Advertisers (as such terms are defined below), may use their own cookies and web beacons in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.\r\n\nGoogle Analytics Advertising Features\r\nWe have implemented certain Google Analytics Advertising Features, including Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, and Remarketing with Google Analytics. We use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie), along with other first-party identifiers, third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) and other third-party identifiers, not only to improve the Site experience for our users, but also to aggregate the characteristics and browsing habits of our users, on an anonymous basis, to provide products and services that are more tailored to our users. We also use these types of cookies and identifiers to improve and target our marketing and remarketing efforts and serve ads based on our users’ prior visits to our Site, also on an anonymous basis. We do not use cookies of any kind to disclose or transmit Personal Data. There are a number of ways you can opt out of the Google Analytics Advertiser Features we use, including via changing your Ads Settings on Google or changing the ads settings on the web browser you are using. You can also use the opt-out tool provided by the Network Advertising Initiative, here. Google provides a free browser add-on, called the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, which provides website users the ability to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics. The browser add-on may be downloaded here.\r\n\nAdvertising\r\nWe may work with third-party advertisers, search providers and ad networks (“Advertisers”). Advertisers may collect and use information about your use of the Site or Services as well as other websites and services to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. These companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as web beacons to collect such information. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an ad network may collect from you. Advertisements may be shown via the Site, the Services, or on third-party websites. You can visit the Network Advertising Initiative website at www.networkadvertising.org, which offers information about Internet advertising companies and how to opt out of their information collection.\r\n\nHOW WE SHARE INFORMATION\r\nGenerally\r\nWe will not disclose your Personal Data to third parties, including for their direct marketing purposes, without your consent, except as explained in this Privacy Policy or permitted by law. We may disclose to third parties certain Usage Data regarding the Site and Services. However, in such cases, your Usage Data is aggregated with the Usage Data of others and does not identify you individually.\r\n\nProfile Information You Make Available to Others\r\nBy using the Site or the Services you may make certain types of your Personal Data available to others. For example, if your user name contains your real name, and you post a comment in a public area of the Site, other users may see your name and other information from your public profile that you choose to make available to others, such as your home town. The information you choose to make publicly available may be accessed by users who use the Site or Services and may be accessed by commercial search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing to the extent that such engines are permitted to access the Site.\r\n\nThird-Party Providers\r\nFrom time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses whom we believe trustworthy and who we believe have privacy practices that are consistent with ours (“Third-Party Providers”). For example, we may contract with Third-Party Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, payment processing, and marketing and promotions. We only provide our Third-Party Providers with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider is expected to use reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Third-Party Providers are prohibited from using Personal Data other than as specified by Poker Central.\r\n\nAs an example of services being provided by Third-Party Providers, payment processing services for goods and/or services purchased on the Site may be provided by Endeavor Streaming Limited, a subsidiary of Endeavor Streaming, Inc., on behalf of Endeavor Streaming, Inc., depending on the type of payment method used for the purchase of the goods and/or services.\r\n\nJoint Services\r\nWe may provide services jointly with other companies. In some cases, to facilitate such services, it may be necessary to share your Personal Data with such other companies. Before we do so, we will identify the partner, present the joint service provider’s privacy policy to you before you use that service, and obtain your permission to share your Personal Data.\r\n\nThird-Party Services and Applications\r\nThrough the Site and the Services, you may have the ability to elect to access third-party services and applications, such as Facebook and other social networks. When you do so, you may be able to import information from those other services and applications and share content with those services. Some of those third-party services may also provide us with information from your accounts which may enable us to enhance and personalize your use of the Site and Services (e.g., so that you can follow your Facebook friends’ activity on the Site or Services). If you elect to use such third-party services or applications through the Services, the information you share with such third-party services and applications will be subject to their privacy policies and your privacy settings for such services. You also may be able to control or block such sharing by changing your privacy settings in such services or applications.\r\n\nOther Transfers\r\nWe may share Personal Data and Usage Data with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Poker Central. If Poker Central is merged, acquired or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Data and Usage Data in connection with such transaction. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if, in our reasonable judgment, the new entity plans to handle your information in a way that differs materially from this Privacy Policy.\r\n\nCompliance with Laws and Law Enforcement\r\nPoker Central cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with applicable law. We may disclose Personal Data, Usage Data and any other information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property or rights of Poker Central or of any third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with applicable law.\r\n\nSharing Information with Others\r\nPlease be aware that whenever you share information on public forums on the Site, that information may be accessed by others. In addition, please remember that when you share information in any other communications with third parties, that information may be passed along or made public by others.

I bought on my AppleTV. It shows up in my purchases in my App Store subscriptions, however it won’t let me restore purchases successfully from my iPad, so I can’t watch on other devices. It also doesn’t allow me to figure out my password or reset it from my iPad. Since I’m now away from my Apple TV for a while, this subscription is useless to me. Will ask for a refund unless someone can help address this issue with me. \n\nGreat content is there, but it’s such a pain to use, I’ll just find other poker content elsewhere.\n\nUPDATE - PokerGO contacted me and I was able to resolve the issue. The AppleTV signup didn’t require a password and I needed to reset the password to play on the iPad. The App still is not perfect (hard to surf), but the content is excellent and they honestly tried to help.

PokerGo is an AMAZING platform for the casual fan and especially a poker fiend and player like me! I too had ONE huge issue when I first subscribed and that was the casting engine in particular. Quite frankly it just didn’t work well and sometimes not at all! I voiced my complaints and PG have gone above and beyond what a normal company usually would do. Not only did I receive credit for a month of service because of not being able to stream but they TRULY listened to my issues, relayed them to their tech support team and now a month away from my one year of being a subscriber have fixed EVERYTHING!! Next is the content. Sure in it’s infancy the ORIGINAL content was a little lacking. Not anymore. It’s great. Poker After Dark is back!! 100+ days of live stream (events you would NEVER see) if not for PG in full HD are great!! No commercials and unedited commentary (love it). I believe they are even giving a month free trial during the WSOP summer! After that 10 clams a month! I will be a subscriber for as long as I am a poker fan and player!!

I wish I could stream these events on Twitch instead to have a chat room, but of course if PokerGo would not be able to provide this live, rather in 8hr clips that do not save where you left off...\n\nAnyways, I had some problems with this app last year, happily I subscribed for the last 11 months but unfortunately re subscribing to watch this seasons poker events.

You can’t actually watch anything without a paid subscription, but I knew that going in and didn’t have an issue paying for quality content. But the apps for iPhone, iPad, and AppleTV are so poorly done they are basically unusable. \n\nNone of the apps mark your progress, so you are left guessing which episodes you’ve seen. There’s also no way to let it auto advance to the next episode, you have to go back to the series page and take another guess at what’s next. On AppleTV, entire series won’t even load. \n\nBut the last straw was when the apps stopped recognizing my App Store purchase. There’s no “restore my purchase” option at all on AppleTV, and while there’s an option for it on the iPad and iPhone apps, it no longer works. I both canceled my subscription and asked for a refund of my current month, since there’s no way to use it.","title":"Love the content, but painfully buggy on all platforms","userName":"malkiyyah13"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6834143850","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-01-05T15:44:05Z","developerResponse":{"id":20278258,"body":"Hi Brandon!

So I am basically having to make notes of which season, which episodes I am currently watching and furthermore, the time stamp of where I am at in a specific episode to be able to fast forward to that spot.
