We end up forgetting what and why we truly are eating. We just simply turn to food, shovel it down and move on.\n\nThe impact of this behavior on our health is both physical and emotional. Getting us into a loop where we find ourselves digging a deeper hole to health problems. We try diets and other quick fixes, but all they do for us, in the long run, is cause us to be even more stressed and frustrated.\n\nThat is why we built Ate, the mindful food diary that is thoughtfully designed to help you be more self-aware of your eating habits, behaviors, and feelings. All done without ever judging you or making you feel bad.\n\nAn easy to use food diary built around positive reinforcement. Something that easily fits into your life and you will enjoy using. A tool to help you discover behaviors that are taking you forward, and turn them into healthy habits. While suggesting you new behaviors to replace the other behaviors that would have taken you in the wrong direction.\n\nWe worked with health professionals around the world and built the app on journaling techniques that have been proven over decades.\n\nThis food diary app is not about crash diets or restrictive living by calorie counting. It’s about building a sustainable, healthy lifestyle. A better version of yourself one small habit at a time. Something that you can easily maintain and enjoy in the long run.\n\nDownload the Ate Food Journal today and start on your new path!\n\n\nPremium Subscription\nAte’s core features are free to use and will stay free.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve tried myfitnesspal calorie counting, daily photo journals, and also just writing out the food but the interface of this app is aesthetically pleasing and visually appealing as well as directed. The option to chose “off path” or “on path” with the reminder of what your current goal is at the top of the screen is brilliantly simple and helps me to minimize obsessive food thoughts like “I ate so bad I’m so fat” or “i ate an apple today so that makes up for the ice cream and chips and cookies I ate the rest of the day” etc etc. It even lets you make a collage of your food pictures at the end of the day, which is a perfect way to visualize what you’re putting into your body. Oh, and you can track calories in the comments under your picture but you can also track where you ate, if you ate alone or with people, why you ate, and how it made you feel which is a genius way to help people make the lifestyle change into eating healthier (instead of forcing yourself to eat ‘healthy’ foods you despise you can focus on the healthy foods you adore). I’ve been searching for an app like this for years and I’m very happy I’ve finally come across it. I hope to use it for a while, and I really appreciate that it’s a free app with no ads. Hands down my favorite health app.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been using ate for about a week, and there are several things I love about it: <br />1. Flexibility. The app allows me to define my own goal, how I want to try to achieve it, and which factors I want to track. <br />2. Ease. Tracking calories is tedious, especially if you cook a lot of your own food, and it can be impossible when you eat out. And really, I know when I’m making healthy choices and when I’m not. With ate, all I have to do is take a quick photo (only momentarily awkward over lunch with colleagues) and follow up later to answer a few questions about it.<br />3. Positivity. The app encourages me to think about how I make choices about food and how those choices make me feel, rather than focusing solely on calories or weight goals. This seems more sustainable — if I feel better today because I ate better, I’m likely to continue eating better, instead of giving up because I’m discouraged by my slowly changing body. I also like that the app subtly encourages me to aim to be 70% to 90% on track, as a reminder not to get down on myself for occasional treats.<br />4. Graphs! I love data. And since I tend to compartmentalize poor dietary choices from meal to meal and day to day, it’s exactly what I need to give myself perspective on how I’m doing overall, not just today.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have never reviewed an app before, so that tells you something right off the bat. I have loved the ease in this app. Meal tracking has always stressed me out. I hate measuring things. My meals are too elaborate to traditionally track. Being able to snap a picture (which I usually already do anyways😂 #foodblog) and add a description makes “tracking” so much easier! I’m able to share this app with my nutritionist and she can have an idea of what I am eating in a day without me having to track. The summary questions have allowed me to have a much better relationship with my meals, realizing trends and habits that I may not have realized before. It forces me to slow down and ask myself these important questions. I love it. <br /><br />I also have noticed great management of this app. I’ve never felt more personally connected to an app developing company than with this app. After reading the app updates, you can tell this is a small company that is properly run by people who truly care for their community. I received an authentic email explaining the importance and their appreciation for reviews. It is clear that this company cares for their users and creating an app that will best serve them. <br /><br />All in all, 5 stars from me!</p>

I have done weight watchers for years, Paleo, tried Keto etc... this app is exactly what I needed to help me. I wanted to eat a granola bar right after dinner... really really? But I didn’t want to have to take a photo of it so I drank water instead! Thank you! Thank you! I have been doing this for about a week and have lost 3 pounds. It is making me drink more water too.\"\n\n\"Throw away your spreadsheets, delete your other apps because this app is SO RAD you won’t need anything else. It tracks enough info to be useful and interesting, yet it doesn’t track so much that it’s cumbersome or overwhelming. It’s like the little bear in the Goldilocks children’s story ... juuuuussst right. The UI is simple and sleek. It’s so easy that you’ll WANT to log your food and that’ll keep you going and get you to your goal. Good luck!\"\n\n\"I love that I can track how long it’s been since my last meal. The diet plan I follow has me eating every 3-4 hours. I can setup a reminder to tell me it’s time to eat 3-4 hours after my meal.\"\n\nSomebody even called us a “Food angel on their shoulders”!

We now offer a 7-DAY FREE TRIAL!\n\n- Other changes - \nWe have also cleaned up the UI a bit, with all journaling options now available under “Add Other” in the navigation bar. To add a secondary button for easy access, tap on the menu option under “Add new’.\n\n______________\nRecent updates:\n\n- Custom Question/Answer sets - \nCustomize the question/answer sets under meal details. Did the default answers not match your needs? Looking to track your hunger levels on a hunger scale? Or track carb content? Custom Q/As will allow you to do all that for each meal. Customize existing answers or add brand new ones with a custom graph automatically generated for you.  (Premium)\n\n- Share your Day - \nSwipe left on the “Share your Day” image to show meal descriptions or answers to your mindful questions over each associate meal image. You can find them both under the new Day Recap view.\n\nShare it on Instagram, tag it with #ateapp and we will reshare it in our Instagram Story. \nOr share it on Facebook with your tribe. \n\n- Save Location -\nWe have also added a new experimental feature: Save the location of your meals. Basically, we take your current location and attach it to the meal you just saved. We plan to use this in a search/map feature we are considering adding. We are also open to other ideas you might have. Anyway, we wanted to give you a chance to start saving that data in your diary while we figure out what to do with it. It’s turned off by default and we will not share it with anyone. So if you want to start saving location, you have to enable it in settings. \n\n- Daily Steps -\nWe have also added daily step counts and activity rings from Apple Health to the Day Recap view for our Premium users. \n\n- Watch 4 support with Water tracking - \nWe have updated our Apple Watch app to fully support all the new complications in Watch 4. We have also added the capability to easily track your water intake from your wrist. \n\n- Mood Tracking -\nThis was a big request! Track your mood throughout the day. Feeling happy or bored during the day? Log it quickly with a few taps. It can help you understand why you made some of the decisions that you made. (Premium)\n\n- Apple Health sync for Water and Activities - \nYou can now elect to sync your water intake and activity data with Apple Health. So if you are using an external tracker (like your Apple Watch) that syncs with Apple Health, all that data will now show up on your path in the app. Of course, we also sync in the other direction, so if you quickly need to log water or an activity, like yoga, it will be pushed to Apple Health. (Premium)\n\n- VoiceOver support - \nWe added full VoiceOver support for our visually impaired users. We are super excited to have them on ate and looking forward to their feedback on what else we can improve on. \n","releaseDate":"2019-06-12"}],"hasPrivacyPolicyText":false,"promotionalText":"Say it

We end up forgetting what and why we truly are eating. We just simply turn to food, shovel it down and move on.\n\nThe impact of this behavior on our health is both physical and emotional. Getting us into a loop where we find ourselves digging a deeper hole to health problems. We try diets and other quick fixes, but all they do for us, in the long run, is cause us to be even more stressed and frustrated.\n\nThat is why we built Ate, the mindful food diary that is thoughtfully designed to help you be more self-aware of your eating habits, behaviors, and feelings. All done without ever judging you or making you feel bad.\n\nAn easy to use food diary built around positive reinforcement. Something that easily fits into your life and you will enjoy using. A tool to help you discover behaviors that are taking you forward, and turn them into healthy habits. While suggesting you new behaviors to replace the other behaviors that would have taken you in the wrong direction.\n\nWe worked with health professionals around the world and built the app on journaling techniques that have been proven over decades.\n\nThis food diary app is not about crash diets or restrictive living by calorie counting. It’s about building a sustainable, healthy lifestyle. A better version of yourself one small habit at a time. Something that you can easily maintain and enjoy in the long run.\n\nDownload the Ate Food Journal today and start on your new path!\n\n\nPremium Subscription\nAte’s core features are free to use and will stay free.

The option to chose “off path” or “on path” with the reminder of what your current goal is at the top of the screen is brilliantly simple and helps me to minimize obsessive food thoughts like “I ate so bad I’m so fat” or “i ate an apple today so that makes up for the ice cream and chips and cookies I ate the rest of the day” etc etc. It even lets you make a collage of your food pictures at the end of the day, which is a perfect way to visualize what you’re putting into your body. Oh, and you can track calories in the comments under your picture but you can also track where you ate, if you ate alone or with people, why you ate, and how it made you feel which is a genius way to help people make the lifestyle change into eating healthier (instead of forcing yourself to eat ‘healthy’ foods you despise you can focus on the healthy foods you adore). I’ve been searching for an app like this for years and I’m very happy I’ve finally come across it. I hope to use it for a while, and I really appreciate that it’s a free app with no ads. Hands down my favorite health app.","title":"Most useful and efficient food tracking","userName":"foxesnoxes"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5395433792","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-01-12T19:37:43Z","developerResponse":{"id":19964850,"body":"Great to hear that you are loving the app. Our goal was to build an easy to use photo based food diary that is non-judgmental and helps you make a sustainable lifestyle change.

The app allows me to define my own goal, how I want to try to achieve it, and which factors I want to track. \n2. Ease. Tracking calories is tedious, especially if you cook a lot of your own food, and it can be impossible when you eat out. And really, I know when I’m making healthy choices and when I’m not. With ate, all I have to do is take a quick photo (only momentarily awkward over lunch with colleagues) and follow up later to answer a few questions about it.\n3. Positivity. The app encourages me to think about how I make choices about food and how those choices make me feel, rather than focusing solely on calories or weight goals. This seems more sustainable — if I feel better today because I ate better, I’m likely to continue eating better, instead of giving up because I’m discouraged by my slowly changing body. I also like that the app subtly encourages me to aim to be 70% to 90% on track, as a reminder not to get down on myself for occasional treats.\n4. Graphs! I love data. And since I tend to compartmentalize poor dietary choices from meal to meal and day to day, it’s exactly what I need to give myself perspective on how I’m doing overall, not just today.","title":"So far, so good!","userName":"Amber Waves Hello"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6539367954","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-16T00:23:49Z","developerResponse":{"id":19964891,"body":"Helping you transform your relationship with food is what we strive for.

I have loved the ease in this app. Meal tracking has always stressed me out. I hate measuring things. My meals are too elaborate to traditionally track. Being able to snap a picture (which I usually already do anyways😂 #foodblog) and add a description makes “tracking” so much easier! I’m able to share this app with my nutritionist and she can have an idea of what I am eating in a day without me having to track. The summary questions have allowed me to have a much better relationship with my meals, realizing trends and habits that I may not have realized before. It forces me to slow down and ask myself these important questions. I love it. \n\nI also have noticed great management of this app. I’ve never felt more personally connected to an app developing company than with this app. After reading the app updates, you can tell this is a small company that is properly run by people who truly care for their community. I received an authentic email explaining the importance and their appreciation for reviews. It is clear that this company cares for their users and creating an app that will best serve them. \n\nAll in all, 5 stars from me!","title":"Great app and great management!","userName":"zgrooms"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6054183327","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-09T10:07:44Z","developerResponse":{"id":19964919,"body":"Thanks for the feedback.

Before finding Ate, I tested multiple fasting apps and nothing worked well or was set up good. I don’t even think I want to fast for the reasons on other apps. This app is GREAT. I’ve always taken pictures of my food and saved them, especially when I cook a meal or fix a healthy breakfast for example. Ate allows me to see what I eat in a day and it lets me record how it made me feel (I LOVE this part of the app because I struggle with how food makes me feel). I also love that it adds options such as “who did you eat with?” and “where did you eat?” Overall this app seems perfect for me and I hope I continue to use this to track my food habits. \n\nThe only thing I can think of that I could suggest is to add a way to type something instead of just selecting “Happy” as a feeling for example. I’d like to be able to write a small sentence or come up with my own words as to how my meal made me feel. Same with the others like “where did you eat?”. I ate outside today for breakfast and that was not an option to put down.

I wanted a food diary thing, but don’t want to track calories or even type in every teaspoon of oil I use to cook my dinner. I love that I can quickly type something in, and the photo aspect is unexpectedly great! It’s quick to snap a picture and it motivates me to add things like fruit and vegetables to my plate since I’m visually more apt to notice that I’m skipping them and just eating a sandwich or a piece of toast. I also like the freedom to change what is “on path” for me - since it’s not specific to one type of eating. I really love the little arrow that encourages me to make a healthier choice for my next meal if I do go off path - it’s not judgy and unlike other things I’ve tried, I don’t tend to feel like I’ve “ruined” a day with one meal or food, so I’m more likely to just move on and eat something that is better for me at the next meal rather than derail and start again the next day (or week or whatever!).

The benefits are already so evident.  Having to actually document what, when, and how much you are eating really makes me think twice before eating too much or eating things that aren’t as good for me, which are 2 big goals for me.  Also, because my friends and I follow each other on the app, it’s actually EXCITING to take a picture of my home-cooked, healthy meals or any other instances where I’m making good food choices!  I have also loved tracking how eating made me feel, which is one of the questions the app asks you after your meal.  Tracking my meals is quick and easy, which is important to me, and I’m going to keep using ate!

Taking photos of my meals felt strange to me at first but what I realized is that it really promotes mindfulness and reflection.  You can make notes that go along with the picture, creating a new kind of ritual practice that slows down your meal nicely and easily.  I like all the tracking in terms of hunger level, satisfaction, etc.  But perhaps my favorite thing of all are the “experiments” you get to try.  The one I chose to start with is to take 2 deep breaths before eating.  Even that simple act allows me to connect to my body and spirit so that I can listen to my physical and emotional needs.  My lifelong struggle with stress eating has been exasperated due to the COVID-19 situation.  I didn’t want to spiral back down into the overeating so I found this app. I couldn’t be happier, calmer, or feeling more grounded around food.

The design of this app is pleasing, it’s easy to use, I like the questions they ask you after your meal so you can reflect on whether you made a good choice or not and why. I’m grateful to the makers of this app for understanding that not everybody wants to spend their entire life counting calories, even if we still want to be healthy. Thank you!

A Google search brought up Ate— since it was free and so well reviewed, I downloaded it immediately. I’ve been hooked ever since. \n\nThe design is fun, intuitive, and bright. I love the survey questions with each meal (so revealing!). Tracking my habits is visual and fun. Been using it less than a week now, in conjunction with a 5-day conscious cleanse, and it’s dramatically increased my awareness and helped me stay “on path” with the good habits I’m reinstating with the cleanse. My partner signed up too and we’ve loved being each other’s accountability buddies. \n\nI cannot recommend this app enough to anyone looking to deepen their awareness with their health and body— and maybe even start healing.

I honestly believe that counting calories can trigger eating disorders for some.\n\nI found this app after reading an article in which it was mentioned and I immediately downloaded it because it had so many good reviews. What I love about this app is that it’s simple, it makes you aware of what you’re eating, how fast you’re eating, where you’re eating, what your emotions are when you’re eating, and the way you view your food in your daily routine.\n\nThe visuals strategy work. For the first time, I feel that I really have control of how I’m eating. Before this app I was all over the place with my food routines, and I was definitely eating too fast, and snacking too much. As a result I gained 25 pounds in 2 years. I’m very excited about this app. It’s wonderful.

Try it out!\n\nAte let’s you:\n- Quickly log meals using photos.\n- Easily reflect on and log why you ate.\n- Take a quick glance of your last meal using Widgets.\n- Build sustainable healthy behaviors for lasting change.\n- Experiment with new habits, to see what works for you.\n- Automatically track your fasting (IF 16/8).\n- Share your journey with friends or your coach.\n- Share your day on Social media, if you desire. \n\n\nSay goodbye to mindless eating and become a better version of yourself with Ate!\n\nDon’t wait, start food journaling today with the #1 Photo Food Journal!\n\nWith all the distractions and stress that is present in our lives, it's no surprise that many of us end up eating mindlessly. We end up forgetting what and why we truly are eating. We just simply turn to food, shovel it down and move on.\n\nThe impact of this behavior on our health is both physical and emotional. Getting us into a loop where we find ourselves digging a deeper hole to health problems. We try diets and other quick fixes, but all they do for us, in the long run, is cause us to be even more stressed and frustrated.\n\nThat is why we built Ate, the mindful food diary that is thoughtfully designed to help you be more self-aware of your eating habits, behaviors, and feelings. All done without ever judging you or making you feel bad.\n\nAn easy to use food diary built around positive reinforcement. Something that easily fits into your life and you will enjoy using. A tool to help you discover behaviors that are taking you forward, and turn them into healthy habits. While suggesting you new behaviors to replace the other behaviors that would have taken you in the wrong direction.\n\nWe worked with health professionals around the world and built the app on journaling techniques that have been proven over decades.\n\nThis food diary app is not about crash diets or restrictive living by calorie counting. It’s about building a sustainable, healthy lifestyle. A better version of yourself one small habit at a time. Something that you can easily maintain and enjoy in the long run.\n\nDownload the Ate Food Journal today and start on your new path!\n\n\nPremium Subscription\nAte’s core features are free to use and will stay free.

Love, love, love! :)\n\nWe were featured by Apple in the \"Apps We Love Right Now!\" section. \n\nOf course, they are not the only ones loving us! Just read what our community has to say:\n\n\"Love love love this app!!! Finally an app that helps me keep in track! I have done weight watchers for years, Paleo, tried Keto etc... this app is exactly what I needed to help me. I wanted to eat a granola bar right after dinner... really really? But I didn’t want to have to take a photo of it so I drank water instead! Thank you! Thank you! I have been doing this for about a week and have lost 3 pounds. It is making me drink more water too.\"\n\n\"Throw away your spreadsheets, delete your other apps because this app is SO RAD you won’t need anything else. It tracks enough info to be useful and interesting, yet it doesn’t track so much that it’s cumbersome or overwhelming. It’s like the little bear in the Goldilocks children’s story ... juuuuussst right. The UI is simple and sleek. It’s so easy that you’ll WANT to log your food and that’ll keep you going and get you to your goal. Good luck!\"\n\n\"I love that I can track how long it’s been since my last meal. The diet plan I follow has me eating every 3-4 hours. I can setup a reminder to tell me it’s time to eat 3-4 hours after my meal.\"\n\nSomebody even called us a “Food angel on their shoulders”! Thanks!\n\nKeep the stories and feedback coming! It’s helping us making this the simplest, least judgmental and most effective mindful food diary in the App Store..\n\nHave a mindful day!\n\nEsther\n\n*If you love the app, please help spread the joy by giving us a 5-star review.
