      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The offline viewing doesn’t download lectures efficiently. When queueing the videos to download and selecting multiple courses to download, it tries to download everything in parallel and clogs up the internet stream slowing download speed to a stop which would be faster if videos downloaded one by one. Also it says courses are finished downloading in downloaded courses but its really not completely downloaded. It doesn’t even show a percentage of how much of the course is downloaded. I think offline downloading if made efficiently could help udemy’s website from having too many requests at once from people rewatching already streamed videos. It would be helpful if a stream could be downloaded while watching to save time. Other than offline problems the lectures, tests, and videos work really well on the app. I just hope there is an update to fix the download course option.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>- When you go my courses tab and browse one of your purchased courses in mobile app, there is no link to go to the author profile for looking his/her other courses. You basically need to search instructor name in search section to find his/her other courses. Waste of time. This problem can be solved very easy.  In purchased courses,  a simple button/link which goes instructor profile can be put in the “more” section. Then I can easily look my instructors other courses and enroll them if I like it. <br /><br />- When you look for a new course, you can see the curriculum in extendable way. Tree structure in other words. When you click the “+” sign, you can see the content of the section. This is perfect. If there is a lot of section, it says after showing some section, “There is 19 more section”. 19 is trivial, this number depends on the course. Anyway, when you click this link to see whole section, there is no tree view any more. No “+” sign to extend section content. Which means there is a very big table of contents page. You have to scroll down and up to see everything. It is waste of time. You can implement a tree view after I click to see whole section. Then If I curious about content of the one section, I can click the “+” sign and see the content. You also can add “extend/collapse all section” option. This is more user friendly. <br /><br />Thanks!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The content on Udemy is first class, so that part is 5 star.  So this review is just for the iPhone app.  You can easily play content, and download to play off line, that is very good.  It has a couple of quirks, though, and one deficiency.<br />Quirk 1:  you can’t play/pause using Bluetooth.  I’ll qualify that to say that you can play, but not pause.  I tested with Apple AirPods and Bose Quiet Comfort and neither could pause.  This is inconvenient, because sometimes I’ll have my phone plugged in and will be listening to a lecture and I have to walk over to the phone to pause.<br />Quirk 2:  The “my courses” section will sometimes just appear empty.  If I close &amp; reopen the app, it refreshes and I see my courses.  I think the app doesn’t gracefully handle being connected/disconnected from Internet access and then doesn’t properly display content.<br />Deficiency:  You can’t bookmark or see bookmarks in the app.  These exist in a full Internet browser, and are very useful.  I often use my phone for watching lectures though so I can multitask when the lecture doesn’t require a hands on activity - then I go back to my laptop when needed.   I would like for the app to have bookmarks that are synced to Udemy so that they appear for me everywhere.</p>

Unfortunately, however, no system can be 100% secured, and We cannot guarantee that communications between You and Udemy, the Services, or any information provided to Us in connection with the information We collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of User information at any time. Your password is an important component of Our security system. As such, it is Your responsibility to protect it. Do not share Your password with any third parties. If Your password has been compromised for any reason, You should change it immediately and contact support@udemy.com with any concerns.\n\n10. Your Choices Regarding The Use of Your Information\n\nAs discussed, You can always choose not to provide certain information to Us but You may not be able to use certain features of the Services. If You do not wish to receive promotional communications from Us, You can opt- out by: (i) following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the promotional communication You receive; or (ii) managing Your e-mail preferences by signing into Your Account on the Udemy.com site, clicking on the Account Settings link in under Your Profile button in the site header, and navigating to the Notifications tab.\n\nPlease note that despite Your opt-out choice or indicated email preferences, We will still send You administrative messages regarding the Services, including, for example, administrative confirmations, order confirmation, important updates regarding the Services, and notices regarding our policies.\n\n11. How We Respond to Do-Not-Track Signals\n\nBecause consumers are often unaware that their do-not- track beacons are active, do-not-track does not frequently reflect the actual preferences of Our Users. Accordingly, Udemy does not respond to the federal do-not- track signal. If You would like to receive no promotional communication from Udemy, You are free to follow the procedure described in the previous section to unsubscribe.\n\n12. How to Access \u0026 Update Your Information\n\nYou may access and update Your information that Udemy collects and maintains in the following ways:\n\n1.

When queueing the videos to download and selecting multiple courses to download, it tries to download everything in parallel and clogs up the internet stream slowing download speed to a stop which would be faster if videos downloaded one by one. Also it says courses are finished downloading in downloaded courses but its really not completely downloaded. It doesn’t even show a percentage of how much of the course is downloaded. I think offline downloading if made efficiently could help udemy’s website from having too many requests at once from people rewatching already streamed videos. It would be helpful if a stream could be downloaded while watching to save time. Other than offline problems the lectures, tests, and videos work really well on the app. I just hope there is an update to fix the download course option.","title":"Offline viewing needs work","userName":"Ryneezy481"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2619852803","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-05-31T04:47:34Z","developerResponse":{"id":3676091,"body":"Hi there, thank you so much for your feedback and we really appreciate all of your sincere contribution to the Udemy app. We have recorded these suggestions as a feature request, and we do hope that this will be launched as soon as possible.

You basically need to search instructor name in search section to find his/her other courses. Waste of time. This problem can be solved very easy.  In purchased courses,  a simple button/link which goes instructor profile can be put in the “more” section. Then I can easily look my instructors other courses and enroll them if I like it. \n\n- When you look for a new course, you can see the curriculum in extendable way. Tree structure in other words. When you click the “+” sign, you can see the content of the section. This is perfect. If there is a lot of section, it says after showing some section, “There is 19 more section”. 19 is trivial, this number depends on the course. Anyway, when you click this link to see whole section, there is no tree view any more. No “+” sign to extend section content. Which means there is a very big table of contents page. You have to scroll down and up to see everything. It is waste of time. You can implement a tree view after I click to see whole section. Then If I curious about content of the one section, I can click the “+” sign and see the content. You also can add “extend/collapse all section” option.

So this review is just for the iPhone app.  You can easily play content, and download to play off line, that is very good.  It has a couple of quirks, though, and one deficiency.\nQuirk 1:  you can’t play/pause using Bluetooth.  I’ll qualify that to say that you can play, but not pause.  I tested with Apple AirPods and Bose Quiet Comfort and neither could pause.  This is inconvenient, because sometimes I’ll have my phone plugged in and will be listening to a lecture and I have to walk over to the phone to pause.\nQuirk 2:  The “my courses” section will sometimes just appear empty.  If I close \u0026 reopen the app, it refreshes and I see my courses.  I think the app doesn’t gracefully handle being connected/disconnected from Internet access and then doesn’t properly display content.\nDeficiency:  You can’t bookmark or see bookmarks in the app.  These exist in a full Internet browser, and are very useful.  I often use my phone for watching lectures though so I can multitask when the lecture doesn’t require a hands on activity - then I go back to my laptop when needed.   I would like for the app to have bookmarks that are synced to Udemy so that they appear for me everywhere.","title":"Mostly Great - Has issues with Bluetooth","userName":"Nsxlane"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3786451080","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-02-18T22:04:47Z","developerResponse":{"id":7408042,"body":"Hi there, we sincerely apologize for the downloading and streaming issue.

I stream video from the usual places Netflix etc. without issue in HD but Udemy software is constantly buffering and won’t load making it impossible to use their courses. And I have tried to download courses to the mobile app multiple times. on three different devices, Over different Wi-Fi’s and on phone data plan. I’ve tried downloading different courses to mobile device without success, downloads will usually complete around halfway to 3/4 and then stop and never finished downloading the rest of the way. Since streaming capabilities are clearly not up to par, they should make downloading an option to desktop, otherwise they should notify people before purchasing that you’re only allowed to “rent” their courses since if I cannot download it I technically don’t own it. It’s truly unfortunate because they offer many great courses at very reasonable prices.

I can’t control which part of the video I want to watch from Lock Screen, the slider is disabled now even though it worked before. Also because of the low memory error that is incorrect it cannot keep playing on to the next video. So when I want to play videos in the background I have to: Unlock my phone, open the app, press ok on the low memory error, click to the course I was just in, click the next video, click okay AGAIN on the low memory error that pops up immediately, turn off my phone (which causes the video to pause even though play on background is on) press play then press play a second time because the first time changes the icon to the pause icon but doesn’t actually unpause the video.

Have to rotate device back and forth to “fix” the the issue. Sometimes the next video in the course would play automatically.  Other times, not. Need to restart app to restore functionality sometimes. Would also like to see it updated to support newer devices such as the 2018 iPad Pro I am using.  Would also like to see some of the functionalities such as the playback speed and captioning options made more easily accessible (e.g.  directly on the screen overlay along with the playback buttons).  I believe these functions are used often enough given the nature of the contents (i.e.  training courses) that they deserve to be in a more accessible location rather than behind another menu.

Very annoying to open a course and have a random video immediately start playing. I transition between the app and desktop site and progress has a hard time syncing so, no, I don’t want to pick up where you think I left off. Honestly, I’d like to read the title of the lecture before jumping in or even may want to rewatch the last one to get my bearings. I’d like to choose which lecture I want to watch next as nearly all courses I watch have modules that can be watched out of order. This is basic UX. Clicking on a course should take me to a course. If I want to watch a vid, I’ll click on the vid or a play button. I don’t need you to unintuitively skip steps for me. There is no way to check your progress without auto playing a lecture. \n\nHave also had issues recently where the majority of my lectures did’t load over WiFi, and numbering was completely off.
