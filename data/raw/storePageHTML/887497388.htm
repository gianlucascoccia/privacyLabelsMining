Using the songs in your music collection, Capo guesses the beats, chords, and key of songs to help you break them down to their individual parts. Capo’s unique technology helps you to learn your favorites quickly as you improve your ear along the way.\n\nCapo is simple and yet so, so good, even the professionals use it:\n\n“Capo is AMAZING!!! Very clutch. Especially when parts are kinda tough in the mix that I can’t make out easily. With other apps you lose quality, this still sounds correct.”\n- Omar Edwards: Keyboardist/Music Director for Jay-Z, Rihanna, Kanye West, Eminem, and more\n\n“When I sat down and started using Capo for the first time, I was amazed at how big a punch this little app packs! It's intuitive, convenient, and high-quality.”\n- Rebecca Lovell: Lead Vocals, Electric Guitar, Acoustic Guitar, Mandolin, Piano for Larkin Poe\n\n(Read more at capoapp.com/testimonials)\n\n*** HEAR THE SONG ***\nSlow down playback, scrub to hear specific notes, and easily create regions that loop as you learn to play the tricky parts. Use Capo’s tools to isolate specific instruments and even vocals to learn any part of a song. With a couple simple switches, you can focus on the piano or eliminate everything to practice the guitar solo and make transcription easier.\n\n*** BREAK IT DOWN ***\nCapo automatically detects chords, beats, and the key of songs to get you started. Change, add, or remove the detected chords easily with a few taps as you identify alternate chords and voicings. Use Capo's structure song view to edit Capo's beat grid for songs with changing, or uncommon time signatures.\n\n*** PAUSE THE SESSION (PRO) ***\nWith an active subscription, Capo saves the loop regions you set, chord changes, and even the playback position into Projects.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Learn your favorite songs without tabs or sheet music.<br /><br />Whether you play for the world or yourself, all musicians need a good ear for harmony, melody, and rhythm. Using the songs in your music collection, Capo guesses the beats, chords, and key of songs to help you break them down to their individual parts. Capo’s unique technology helps you to learn your favorites quickly as you improve your ear along the way.<br /><br />Capo is simple and yet so, so good, even the professionals use it:<br /><br />“Capo is AMAZING!!! Very clutch. Especially when parts are kinda tough in the mix that I can’t make out easily. With other apps you lose quality, this still sounds correct.”<br />- Omar Edwards: Keyboardist/Music Director for Jay-Z, Rihanna, Kanye West, Eminem, and more<br /><br />“When I sat down and started using Capo for the first time, I was amazed at how big a punch this little app packs! It&#39;s intuitive, convenient, and high-quality.”<br />- Rebecca Lovell: Lead Vocals, Electric Guitar, Acoustic Guitar, Mandolin, Piano for Larkin Poe<br /><br />(Read more at capoapp.com/testimonials)<br /><br />*** HEAR THE SONG ***<br />Slow down playback, scrub to hear specific notes, and easily create regions that loop as you learn to play the tricky parts. Use Capo’s tools to isolate specific instruments and even vocals to learn any part of a song. With a couple simple switches, you can focus on the piano or eliminate everything to practice the guitar solo and make transcription easier.<br /><br />*** BREAK IT DOWN ***<br />Capo automatically detects chords, beats, and the key of songs to get you started. Change, add, or remove the detected chords easily with a few taps as you identify alternate chords and voicings. Use Capo&#39;s structure song view to edit Capo&#39;s beat grid for songs with changing, or uncommon time signatures.<br /><br />*** PAUSE THE SESSION (PRO) ***<br />With an active subscription, Capo saves the loop regions you set, chord changes, and even the playback position into Projects. Learn songs at your own pace and revisit them on all your devices using iCloud.<br /><br />*** SO MUCH MORE ***<br />* Transpose songs to different keys<br />* Rename regions to keep organized<br />* Beat detection estimates the tempo and helps snap regions<br />* Edit chords one at a time or globally<br />* Display chord diagrams for Guitar, Banjo, Mandolin, Ukulele, Bass, and now Piano<br />* Rock on southpaws! Capo has a left-handed chord box option<br />* Five different metronome sounds<br />* Learn more about Capo touch Pro below!<br /><br />**NOTE**: Capo works with music you own, but cannot access streaming tracks from Apple Music, Spotify, etc.<br />* If you don’t own a particular track, Capo makes it simple to buy a DRM-free copy on the iTunes Store<br /><br />*** GO PRO ***<br />Without an active subscription, Capo touch will not save your edits to the chords, beats, regions, markers, or sections in your Projects.<br /><br />For $19.99 per year, Capo touch Pro:<br /><br />* Saves all your changes to Projects, which are synced across your devices<br />* Provides full access to upcoming features and improvements<br />* Helps support future development of the product<br /><br />*** GO PLATINUM ***<br />For $49.99 per year, Capo Platinum gives you everything in Capo touch Pro *plus* the ability to unlock all the features in Capo for macOS.<br /><br />All prices shown in this description are in USD.

But the more you know about music, the more uses you will discover, as you explore its sophistication.

</h3>

  <blockquote id="ember42246639" class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive ember-view we-customer-review__body">      

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>As an amateur musician, I’ve found Capo to be the best App out there for learning Jazz solos and the intricate ornamentation of Irish tunes.  It provides the cleanest “slow-down” of any of the apps that I’ve tried.  The flexibility of its looping and other playback features makes it much easier to breakdown complicated riffs.  It’s ability to sort out the key and chord changes is truly remarkable; while not infallible, this provides a great starting point for piecing together transcriptions for both chord and melody instruments.  The interface is clean and very well thought out.  This becomes even more obvious the longer you use Capo, since its many capabilities do require some patience to learn/uncover.  I could go on and on. <br /><br />The developers are solid and seem committed to a quality product for the long term, as evidenced by the updates that have been deployed since Capo’s inception (check out their newsletter to get a sense of what their team is about).  At $10 a YEAR, this app is way worth it!  <br /><br />One suggestion.  I’d love there to be an option to have the identified/edited chords automatically sound out, while the original recording rolls along in the background - rather than having to tap each and every chord symbol at the appropriate moments.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Subscription services are lucrative for developers, I guess.  But, for the user I have to decide which apps to subscribe to (if any) and which ones I have to quit using because I can’t afford a subscription for every app I use.  I don’t mind buying an app at all, but having to pay an annual fee is just beyond my means.  And so, I will switch my slow-down app to something else other than Capo because they, at some point, will go to the next version (x.x or Y.x or whatever) and I will be left in the dust having to subscribe again to enjoy some minor tweak of the app.  If every developer ends up with subscription requirements I will just have to abandon my support for them all.  How many $50, $20,  $75, $20, $40, $20, $25 services can you afford?  For me it’s not many and so I just stop using an app that thinks their product should charge me a monthly or annual fee to use it!!  There are plenty of alternatives out there.  The smart developer should appreciate their customer’s PURCHASE of an app, like I did with Capo years ago, to support their further development of the app.  They should take into consideration that users will have to decide which apps to keep or which apps to abandon.  The less used apps I have will be the first to go.  And, Capo falls into that category as there are many alternatives that don’t require a subscription fee after purchase.</p>

If you'd like to read more about the development of this new technology, visit our blog at supermegaultragroovy.com.\n\n\nSong Views (iOS 14+)\n\nFollowing Capo's counterpart on macOS, Capo touch offers alternate views of your song that are tailored to specific tasks while you're learning. You can switch between the available song views by tapping the new button that appears at the top-right of the project view.\n\n\nStructure Song View (Subscription Only, iOS 14+)\n\nYou can now see and mark up your songs at a high level—bar by bar—to define the sections of the song. Mark the Verse, Chorus, A Section, B Section, or use whatever names you choose! You can also apply colors to the sections to help you identify similar ones.\n\nMany users will be excited to learn that this all-new song view _also_ allows you to edit Capo's beat grid that's used to power Capo's snapping and metronome features. By clicking along with the beat to mark the start of each bar, you can replace Capo's detected beats with your own. You can also change the number of beats in specific bars when you're working with songs that have mixed time signatures, and make fine adjustments to improve precision.\n\n\nChords Song View (Subscription Only, iOS 14+)\n\nAn all-new, vertically-scrolling look at the chords in your song displays more chords on screen at the same time. It also uses the sections you define in the Structure song view to group the chords according to the section they belong in.\n\nThis is a massive improvement for chord-oriented musicians that are looking to analyze a song's overall harmony, or those that want a better view of what's coming ahead.\n\n\nTrial Mode (Paid, Non-Subscribers)\n\nIf you are a paid user that has not yet subscribed to Capo Pro, you can try the new, subscription-only features as many times as you'd like, for as long as you'd like! Just select one of the song views that are marked TRIAL, and Capo will let you play with the feature with only one catch—your edits to the project will no longer be saved.\n\nDon't see anything worth paying for? No problem! Close the project, and you'll be back to using Capo as usual. We will keep trying to earn your subscription in future releases, and hope you enjoy the massive improvements to the chord detection engine!\n\n\nImproved Free Edition\n\nThe free version of Capo no longer has a playback timer! You now have full access to Capo's full feature set, but Capo will not save any of your edits to Projects without an active subscription.\n\nThis change results in a more useful product for a wider audience. Teachers, be sure to tell all your students!\n\n\nENHANCEMENTS\n\n* We modified the Simple Piano chord display to make it easier to distinguish the bass note from the others.\n* You can now disable the system-wide display sleep timer from the Settings screen.\n* The Control Strip and play/pause buttons are now easier to tap.\n* Long pressing the time (or bar-beat) indicator in the HUD will reveal the new Go To Time (or Bar-Beat) feature that lets you seek to a specific location in the song.\n* It's now possible to quickly toggle the metronome by long-pressing its icon in the PLAYBACK control strip.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n* Capo no longer crashes in the chord chooser when searching for chord inversions\n* We addressed a handful of crashes that were submitted by users since the last release.

We finally brought this popular feature over from Capo on macOS over to Capo touch.

It scrolls more smoothly, looks better, and was built to support exciting new features.\n- You can now tap on regions to de-select them, which is helpful when a looping region extends past both edges of the screen.\n- The Metronome settings now allow you to enable the click without requiring count-in to be enabled.\n- We switched from an included help file to using online documentation, which is easier for us to keep up-to-date, and easier for you to read. Win-win!\n- The icon in the PLAYBACK control strip now reflects whether count-in is active, or just the metronome.\n- We improved the appearance of the search bar that is displayed when editing chords on iOS 11 and later.\n\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n- The waveform display should no longer flicker at the edges as you scroll through the song.\n- Various issues related to “stretched” numbers in the timeline have all been resolved.\n- When creating a New Project, you are now asked to select between browsing your Music library or choosing an audio file to import.

This work should improve the overall accuracy of Capo’s results, and it paves the way for some features that we plan to add in the coming months.\n\nTo help celebrate these improvements, we’ve expanded the trial to allow access to the chord detection results and increased the playback timer to 60 seconds!\n\nNote: If you’re running an older device, you may notice that it now takes longer to process songs when they are first imported—Capo’s doing a *lot* more detailed analysis than before, so this is to be expected. We hope to improve this in future updates, so stay tuned!\n\nEnhancements: \n\n• When operating in trial mode, Capo now indicates the remaining playback time and provides a brief explanation of the trial limitations\n\nBug Fixes:\n\n• The “Capo Needs Your Help” window no longer gets stuck after trying to download songs from the cloud\n• When browsing through your music collection, the search bar should no longer get lost after navigating into one of the Albums, Artists, or Playlist search results\n• We’ve restored the ability to rename regions—sorry about that!\n• On iPad devices with keyboards, the play/pause and region shortcut keys have been fixed\n• With songs that have too-long titles, the back button should no longer be obscured\n• Audio controls on the lock screen should be working correctly once again\n• Tapping outside the Control Strip's quick selection menu will now dismiss it\n• When switching outside of Capo to another app, and then back, the chord sounds are no longer muted\n• After loading a project that had muted chords set in the Mixer, new projects will no longer have muted chords\n\nWe love hearing from our customers, so please leave a review on the App Store to share your positive experiences with others, or send us a support email if you have any questions for us.

Tapping the Control Strip Selector beside the time display lets you switch sets, and a long press reveals a menu to switch between sets quickly. This new design allows us to keep extending Capo touch with even more features, so we're really excited to finally ship it!\n\n• We've added the Transcription Playhead that we first introduced in Capo on macOS. The Transcription Playhead allows you to lock the playhead into position so that every time you press Play, the song starts from the same point. This is very handy when you are listening carefully and want to hear a single note, chord, or riff repeatedly while you're trying to identify what note(s) to play.\n\n• The new Mixer allows you to set the playback volume in Capo touch independently from the metronome and the sound of chords when they're tapped. This feature is helpful when the metronome is difficult to hear over an especially loud song, or if you'd like to play Capo's audio alongside your favorite guitar amp simulation apps.\n\n• You can now adjust the playback pitch of a song using a separate slider that's dedicated to this purpose. Adjustments can be made between -100 and +100 cents, which is equivalent to a semitone in either direction. We know it took a very long to introduce this feature, but the Control Strip made it possible to do it *properly*!\n\nNew Subscriber-Only Features:\n\n• None! The new features in this release are available to all our existing customers, so enjoy!\n\nEnhancements:\n\n• Region looping is now much easier to use! Similar to the macOS version of Capo, looping a region is now enabled by simply selecting it. The play button will change to indicate that Capo touch will loop the selected region, and tapping it starts your loop immediately!\n\n• We added controls for Regions and Chords that allow you to move around the song using a left and right arrow to quickly move around the entries stored in your Project. You'll find these in the respective sets of controls in the Control Strip.\n\n• While working on some future improvements, we spent some quality time with the isolation engine and tweaked our approach a little bit to improve the sound quality of the effect. Let us know what you think!\n\nBug Fixes:\n\n• The \"Open In\" functionality in iOS 10.3 has been restored for all you folks that like to import audio files from other apps (such as Mail, Dropbox, etc.) We apologize for any trouble that we caused with this bug in the last update!\n\n• We addressed an issue that led to the isolation's power display to appear flipped, causing energy on the right side to appear on the left, and vice versa. This is now resolved, and we regret any error/confusion that was caused.\n\n• The top crashes were addressed, and we appreciate all your submissions and feedback. Keep it coming so we can keep making the app better with each new update!\n\nPlease leave us a review on the App Store to let us know how you're enjoying Capo touch and the new update.

This was made necessary by changes to iOS 11, but we think it's quite a nice improvement—and it saves you a tap in many cases!\n\nSubscriptions:\n\n• Capo touch now offers a subscription to unlock all its current features as well as exclusive, subscriber-only features that we will be adding in the future.\n\n• NOTE TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS: If you already paid to download Capo touch, a subscription is completely optional!

Read on to see all the improvements that help make the best music learning app for iOS even better.\n\nNew Features:\n\n• Integrated iTunes Purchases - Capo doesn’t want to get in the way of your music discovery, so now it displays *all* the songs that are in your iCloud Music Library, even if you added them from the vast Apple Music catalog. When Capo encounters a song you don’t own, you can now buy it quickly on the iTunes Store and have it ready to learn once it’s done downloading. Fast and easy!\n\n• Open in Music - When the songs you own are stored in the cloud, Capo can now take you directly to the track in the Music app so you can download it to your device and make it available to Capo soon after. This is a *huge* time saver compared to previous releases.\n\n• Improved Audio Scrubbing - During playback, seeking through the song by swiping the waveform will start Capo’s “Audio Freezer” scrubbing engine. Scrolling slowly will let you focus on specific sounds.\n\n• Import audio files directly from iCloud, Dropbox, and more  - Capo now uses the system-wide document provider extensions to give you easy access to audio files stored in the cloud. Quickly download shared stems and early mixes from your collaborators and band mates that you can work immediately without leaving the comfort of Capo.\n\nUser-Requested Improvements:\n\n• Jump to Beginning and End Gestures - Many users have asked for a way to get to the start of the song quickly, and we made it simple to do. Just double-tap the left or right edge of the waveform to jump to the start or end of the song.\n\n• Toggle snapping while adjusting regions - You can now drag your finger above or below the regions’ resize handles to disable beat snapping for songs that do not follow Capo’s detected beat grid.\n\nEnhancements:\n\n• We've added a “What's New” onboarding experience that allows us to share exciting new features with our customers in video form as we continue to add more of them in future updates. You can get back to these videos at any time from Settings.\n\n• All-new project browsing - We overhauled the project list to provide a faster, and far more useful view of your projects. Projects can now be sorted by modification date (keeping the newest at the top), or title, and of course they can be searched as well.\n\n• Increment and decrement buttons for speed and pitch - Just tap the + and - buttons on either side of the speed and pitch slider to increment their values by either 1%, or one semitone at a time. A small improvement, but very handy!\n\nBug Fixes:\n\n•  Capo no longer deletes markers that were saved in Capo 3 on the Mac\n•  The playhead location is properly restored when re-opening a project\n•  Capo now reports playback position on the Now Playing screen\n•  When closing a project, Capo no longer appears on the Now Playing screen in Control Center\n•  The playhead no longer jumps around when starting playback\n•  The section headers (aka “The alphabet”) in My Music views no longer appear when there are too few items to jump between\n•  Plus-sized phones will no longer display the iPad-sized region titles in landscape\n•  Fixed all of our top crashes.

It provides the cleanest “slow-down” of any of the apps that I’ve tried.  The flexibility of its looping and other playback features makes it much easier to breakdown complicated riffs.  It’s ability to sort out the key and chord changes is truly remarkable; while not infallible, this provides a great starting point for piecing together transcriptions for both chord and melody instruments.  The interface is clean and very well thought out.  This becomes even more obvious the longer you use Capo, since its many capabilities do require some patience to learn/uncover.  I could go on and on. \n\nThe developers are solid and seem committed to a quality product for the long term, as evidenced by the updates that have been deployed since Capo’s inception (check out their newsletter to get a sense of what their team is about).  At $10 a YEAR, this app is way worth it!  \n\nOne suggestion.  I’d love there to be an option to have the identified/edited chords automatically sound out, while the original recording rolls along in the background - rather than having to tap each and every chord symbol at the appropriate moments.","title":"Best app for learning Jazz solos and Irish tunes from recordings.","userName":"IceKole"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5799495474","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-12T06:06:14Z","rating":1,"review":"Subscription services are lucrative for developers, I guess.  But, for the user I have to decide which apps to subscribe to (if any) and which ones I have to quit using because I can’t afford a subscription for every app I use.  I don’t mind buying an app at all, but having to pay an annual fee is just beyond my means.  And so, I will switch my slow-down app to something else other than Capo because they, at some point, will go to the next version (x.x or Y.x or whatever) and I will be left in the dust having to subscribe again to enjoy some minor tweak of the app.  If every developer ends up with subscription requirements I will just have to abandon my support for them all.  How many $50, $20,  $75, $20, $40, $20, $25 services can you afford?  For me it’s not many and so I just stop using an app that thinks their product should charge me a monthly or annual fee to use it!!  There are plenty of alternatives out there.  The smart developer should appreciate their customer’s PURCHASE of an app, like I did with Capo years ago, to support their further development of the app.  They should take into consideration that users will have to decide which apps to keep or which apps to abandon.  The less used apps I have will be the first to go.  And, Capo falls into that category as there are many alternatives that don’t require a subscription fee after purchase.","title":"Ihopeyougobroke","userName":"Wdav"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3321117622","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-10-20T00:41:20Z","developerResponse":{"id":5944576,"body":"Thanks so much for this review of Capo.

I think it’s one of the better tools for transcription.  But I have since encountered a bug in the app that prevents me from using it in any meaningful way.  This is why I have rated it 1 star.\n\nHere’s my issue: \nI have a Capo touch Pro subscription, but the Capo app will only let me play a 60-second trial of the song I’m trying to transcribe.  In the song playback mode it thinks I am a trial user.  The app tells me that I have a current subscription—when I go to “Choose a Plan” under Settings it says as much—but it won’t let me listen to a song for more than 60 seconds.  This makes the app unusable.  \n\nI contacted Capo support, who was initially quite responsive but weeks later they still have not fixed the problem.  I like this app, but I am very disappointed that I have spent money on an annual subscription that is currently getting wasted as time goes by where I cannot use it.  I hope they fix the problem soon so I can use the remainder of my annual subscription.","title":"App Doesn’t Recognize Subscription","userName":"Roshi_Thel"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3247808887","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-09-30T13:31:31Z","developerResponse":{"id":5944868,"body":"Wow!

harmony, melody, and rhythm. Using the songs in your music collection, Capo guesses the beats, chords, and key of songs to help you break them down to their individual parts. Capo’s unique technology helps you to learn your favorites quickly as you improve your ear along the way.\n\nCapo is simple and yet so, so good, even the professionals use it:\n\n“Capo is AMAZING!!! Very clutch. Especially when parts are kinda tough in the mix that I can’t make out easily. With other apps you lose quality, this still sounds correct.”\n- Omar Edwards: Keyboardist/Music Director for Jay-Z, Rihanna, Kanye West, Eminem, and more\n\n“When I sat down and started using Capo for the first time, I was amazed at how big a punch this little app packs! It's intuitive, convenient, and high-quality.”\n- Rebecca Lovell: Lead Vocals, Electric Guitar, Acoustic Guitar, Mandolin, Piano for Larkin Poe\n\n(Read more at capoapp.com/testimonials)\n\n*** HEAR THE SONG ***\nSlow down playback, scrub to hear specific notes, and easily create regions that loop as you learn to play the tricky parts. Use Capo’s tools to isolate specific instruments and even vocals to learn any part of a song. With a couple simple switches, you can focus on the piano or eliminate everything to practice the guitar solo and make transcription easier.\n\n*** BREAK IT DOWN ***\nCapo automatically detects chords, beats, and the key of songs to get you started. Change, add, or remove the detected chords easily with a few taps as you identify alternate chords and voicings. Use Capo's structure song view to edit Capo's beat grid for songs with changing, or uncommon time signatures.\n\n*** PAUSE THE SESSION (PRO) ***\nWith an active subscription, Capo saves the loop regions you set, chord changes, and even the playback position into Projects. Learn songs at your own pace and revisit them on all your devices using iCloud.\n\n*** SO MUCH MORE ***\n* Transpose songs to different keys\n* Rename regions to keep organized\n* Beat detection estimates the tempo and helps snap regions\n* Edit chords one at a time or globally\n* Display chord diagrams for Guitar, Banjo, Mandolin, Ukulele, Bass, and now Piano\n* Rock on southpaws! Capo has a left-handed chord box option\n* Five different metronome sounds\n* Learn more about Capo touch Pro below!\n\n**NOTE**: Capo works with music you own, but cannot access streaming tracks from Apple Music, Spotify, etc.\n* If you don’t own a particular track, Capo makes it simple to buy a DRM-free copy on the iTunes Store\n\n*** GO PRO ***\nWithout an active subscription, Capo touch will not save your edits to the chords, beats, regions, markers, or sections in your Projects.\n\nFor $19.99 per year, Capo touch Pro:\n\n* Saves all your changes to Projects, which are synced across your devices\n* Provides full access to upcoming features and improvements\n* Helps support future development of the product\n\n*** GO PLATINUM ***\nFor $49.99 per year, Capo Platinum gives you everything in Capo touch Pro *plus* the ability to unlock all the features in Capo for macOS.\n\nAll prices shown in this description are in USD.

By clicking along with the beat to mark the start of each bar, you can replace Capo's detected beats with your own. You can also change the number of beats in specific bars when you're working with songs that have mixed time signatures, and make fine adjustments to improve precision.\n\n\nChords Song View (Subscription Only, iOS 14+)\n\nAn all-new, vertically-scrolling look at the chords in your song displays more chords on screen at the same time. It also uses the sections you define in the Structure song view to group the chords according to the section they belong in.\n\nThis is a massive improvement for chord-oriented musicians that are looking to analyze a song's overall harmony, or those that want a better view of what's coming ahead.\n\n\nTrial Mode (Paid, Non-Subscribers)\n\nIf you are a paid user that has not yet subscribed to Capo Pro, you can try the new, subscription-only features as many times as you'd like, for as long as you'd like! Just select one of the song views that are marked TRIAL, and Capo will let you play with the feature with only one catch—your edits to the project will no longer be saved.\n\nDon't see anything worth paying for? No problem! Close the project, and you'll be back to using Capo as usual. We will keep trying to earn your subscription in future releases, and hope you enjoy the massive improvements to the chord detection engine!\n\n\nImproved Free Edition\n\nThe free version of Capo no longer has a playback timer! You now have full access to Capo's full feature set, but Capo will not save any of your edits to Projects without an active subscription.\n\nThis change results in a more useful product for a wider audience. Teachers, be sure to tell all your students!\n\n\nENHANCEMENTS\n\n* We modified the Simple Piano chord display to make it easier to distinguish the bass note from the others.\n* You can now disable the system-wide display sleep timer from the Settings screen.\n* The Control Strip and play/pause buttons are now easier to tap.\n* Long pressing the time (or bar-beat) indicator in the HUD will reveal the new Go To Time (or Bar-Beat) feature that lets you seek to a specific location in the song.\n* It's now possible to quickly toggle the metronome by long-pressing its icon in the PLAYBACK control strip.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\n* Capo no longer crashes in the chord chooser when searching for chord inversions\n* We addressed a handful of crashes that were submitted by users since the last release.

Tapping the Control Strip Selector beside the time display lets you switch sets, and a long press reveals a menu to switch between sets quickly. This new design allows us to keep extending Capo touch with even more features, so we're really excited to finally ship it!\n\n• We've added the Transcription Playhead that we first introduced in Capo on macOS. The Transcription Playhead allows you to lock the playhead into position so that every time you press Play, the song starts from the same point. This is very handy when you are listening carefully and want to hear a single note, chord, or riff repeatedly while you're trying to identify what note(s) to play.\n\n• The new Mixer allows you to set the playback volume in Capo touch independently from the metronome and the sound of chords when they're tapped. This feature is helpful when the metronome is difficult to hear over an especially loud song, or if you'd like to play Capo's audio alongside your favorite guitar amp simulation apps.\n\n• You can now adjust the playback pitch of a song using a separate slider that's dedicated to this purpose. Adjustments can be made between -100 and +100 cents, which is equivalent to a semitone in either direction. We know it took a very long to introduce this feature, but the Control Strip made it possible to do it *properly*!\n\nNew Subscriber-Only Features:\n\n• None! The new features in this release are available to all our existing customers, so enjoy!\n\nEnhancements:\n\n• Region looping is now much easier to use! Similar to the macOS version of Capo, looping a region is now enabled by simply selecting it. The play button will change to indicate that Capo touch will loop the selected region, and tapping it starts your loop immediately!\n\n• We added controls for Regions and Chords that allow you to move around the song using a left and right arrow to quickly move around the entries stored in your Project. You'll find these in the respective sets of controls in the Control Strip.\n\n• While working on some future improvements, we spent some quality time with the isolation engine and tweaked our approach a little bit to improve the sound quality of the effect. Let us know what you think!\n\nBug Fixes:\n\n• The \"Open In\" functionality in iOS 10.3 has been restored for all you folks that like to import audio files from other apps (such as Mail, Dropbox, etc.) We apologize for any trouble that we caused with this bug in the last update!\n\n• We addressed an issue that led to the isolation's power display to appear flipped, causing energy on the right side to appear on the left, and vice versa. This is now resolved, and we regret any error/confusion that was caused.\n\n• The top crashes were addressed, and we appreciate all your submissions and feedback. Keep it coming so we can keep making the app better with each new update!\n\nPlease leave us a review on the App Store to let us know how you're enjoying Capo touch and the new update.

This was made necessary by changes to iOS 11, but we think it's quite a nice improvement—and it saves you a tap in many cases!\n\nSubscriptions:\n\n• Capo touch now offers a subscription to unlock all its current features as well as exclusive, subscriber-only features that we will be adding in the future.\n\n• NOTE TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS: If you already paid to download Capo touch, a subscription is completely optional!

Read on to see all the improvements that help make the best music learning app for iOS even better.\n\nNew Features:\n\n• Integrated iTunes Purchases - Capo doesn’t want to get in the way of your music discovery, so now it displays *all* the songs that are in your iCloud Music Library, even if you added them from the vast Apple Music catalog. When Capo encounters a song you don’t own, you can now buy it quickly on the iTunes Store and have it ready to learn once it’s done downloading. Fast and easy!\n\n• Open in Music - When the songs you own are stored in the cloud, Capo can now take you directly to the track in the Music app so you can download it to your device and make it available to Capo soon after. This is a *huge* time saver compared to previous releases.\n\n• Improved Audio Scrubbing - During playback, seeking through the song by swiping the waveform will start Capo’s “Audio Freezer” scrubbing engine. Scrolling slowly will let you focus on specific sounds.\n\n• Import audio files directly from iCloud, Dropbox, and more  - Capo now uses the system-wide document provider extensions to give you easy access to audio files stored in the cloud. Quickly download shared stems and early mixes from your collaborators and band mates that you can work immediately without leaving the comfort of Capo.\n\nUser-Requested Improvements:\n\n• Jump to Beginning and End Gestures - Many users have asked for a way to get to the start of the song quickly, and we made it simple to do. Just double-tap the left or right edge of the waveform to jump to the start or end of the song.\n\n• Toggle snapping while adjusting regions - You can now drag your finger above or below the regions’ resize handles to disable beat snapping for songs that do not follow Capo’s detected beat grid.\n\nEnhancements:\n\n• We've added a “What's New” onboarding experience that allows us to share exciting new features with our customers in video form as we continue to add more of them in future updates. You can get back to these videos at any time from Settings.\n\n• All-new project browsing - We overhauled the project list to provide a faster, and far more useful view of your projects. Projects can now be sorted by modification date (keeping the newest at the top), or title, and of course they can be searched as well.\n\n• Increment and decrement buttons for speed and pitch - Just tap the + and - buttons on either side of the speed and pitch slider to increment their values by either 1%, or one semitone at a time. A small improvement, but very handy!\n\nBug Fixes:\n\n•  Capo no longer deletes markers that were saved in Capo 3 on the Mac\n•  The playhead location is properly restored when re-opening a project\n•  Capo now reports playback position on the Now Playing screen\n•  When closing a project, Capo no longer appears on the Now Playing screen in Control Center\n•  The playhead no longer jumps around when starting playback\n•  The section headers (aka “The alphabet”) in My Music views no longer appear when there are too few items to jump between\n•  Plus-sized phones will no longer display the iPad-sized region titles in landscape\n•  Fixed all of our top crashes.
