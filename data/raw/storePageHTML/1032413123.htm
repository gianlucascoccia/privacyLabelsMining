These data are used for the sole purpose of obtaining anonymous statistical information on the use of the application and to check its correct functioning. This information is not collected for the identification of users, although it cannot be excluded that, through the normal process of processing and crossings with data held by third parties, it is possible to identify the user. The data could be used to ascertain responsibility in the case of hypothetical computer crimes against the Data Controller or third parties. The provision of such data is necessary for the use of the Application and the use of the related services.\nData provided by users during the registration process: by completing the registration form available on the Karaoke One platform, the user will create his own personal account. The data provided voluntarily by the user will be collected, including, but not limited to, the name, surname, date of birth, e-mail address, profile picture, and data related to the payment instruments used. The data necessary for registration and to be able to use the services provided through the Application will be marked with a special asterisk.
