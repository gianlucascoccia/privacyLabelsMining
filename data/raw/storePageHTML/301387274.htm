      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Pocket god... oh, I remember the days when it was exciting. Wow. I love this game but... HOW COULD YOU STOP UPDATING THIS APP!!!!! Right when you bring in the only girl Pygmy you take her out! This can&#39;t be happening! I noticed that your blog, bolt creative. com is no longer available. And I noticed you are not responding to your reviews. All we need is one more update ONE MORE so we can get SUN!!! ( and hopefully a couple more things too) of you are reading this, DON&#39;T DOWNLOAD THIS APP! You will only be tortured by the knowledge that you will never have a truly satisfying ending. Oh, what a beautiful game this used to be...<br />(Sorry for the long review)</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This game used to be the best. I remember back in school we would wait every week for the new updates. Whenever a new update came out, my friends and I gathered together and played with all the new features. This game was great, so sad it&#39;s over. Re-downloaded it after years of not playing it, and it&#39;s cool to see a few new things. People are complaining that there aren&#39;t any updates, but they don&#39;t know that episode 47 was supposed to be the last one. They did episode 48 just because of popular demand. While I do wish there was a way to have alien pygmy&#39;s, werewolves, and female pygmy&#39;s, the game is packed with fun things to do. Maybe if the developers come back they can make 2 more episodes to finish it off? Just because 50 episodes is a lot cooler than 48 haha. Personally love the app, just kinda sad the graphics are the same and not high resolution like other apps. But I hope one day Bolt decides to finish up this app for good! And just one recommendation: I think Tom and Charlie should have a more distinct look, like Charlie should be in his tiger form permanently instead of just when slicing a Pygmy. I know the two characters are already somewhat distinct with their facial expressions, but it would still be cool. Just my thoughts!</p>

If you guys are reading this, PLEASE, for the love of god, MAKE NEW POCKET GOD CONTENT. I don’t care if it’s a spin-off game like Ooga Jump. I don’t care if it’s a sequel.<br />I don’t care if it’s another update. The community wants more Pocket God! You guys have been working on this game and have been making thousands and millions of dollars from the comics, merchandise, and in-app purchases. Don’t give up on Pocket God! People will still support your content! Don’t believe me? If you check the Entertainment section on the Apple App Store, you will see that Pocket God is the #1 Paid Entertainment App. People are still buying Pocket God! I hope you are convinced to make more Pocket God stuff. Even if you won’t make Pocket God stuff anymore, please give us an update on you guys. You can’t go silent like this.  I’m gonna end this review on one message: WE LOVE POCKET GOD -From the hearts of all the Pocket God lovers</p>

Fix:\nDue to an issue with save data being corrupted, some users are losing their Challenge of the Gods idol data.

In Challenge Options (accessible from the opening screen), there are two new buttons. “Unlock All Challenges” will automatically unlock idols for all episode challenges and “Level Up All Idols” to set all idols to 20. We apologize for any inconvenience. For those of you who haven't lost your save data, Merry Christmas you can now unlock all your challenges and max out your idols.\n\nEpisode 48: Call of Booty\nBy popular demand, we introduce to you a whole new update with a vast new undersea area! Find water wings lying around on an island, put them on a pygmy, and he’ll dive in! Explore the depths of the ocean while hunting for hidden treasure. Use the map to locate pieces of booty while avoiding mines that turn pygmies to stone, face-huggers that impregnate you with their young, and hungry oysters that lurk on the ocean floor. Finding the first piece of booty, kicks off the mini-game and gets the attention of the face-huggers who will start to chase you. Swim and swerve to avoid them! Also, the area wraps so even if the treasure is behind you, the best strategy MAY BE to forge ahead until the treasure cross the screen to the front of you. But be warned, time is limited while the mini-game is going and the pygmy can run out of air. Collecting treasure trapped in air bubbles renews his oxygen supply.

A Monster Ate My Condo gets more nods when you turn the Dodo into a Dodo/Reginald Starfire hybrid, the Doodler into Mr. Shigoto, and, weirdest of all, the shark into the Geisha Finger! Pay homage to Amateur Surgeon by splatting the islands with blood, or by using a hypodermic needle as a spear. The island's moon can be turned into the Robot Unicorn Crystal Star! And more!\n\nIn response, pygmies make a cameo in Adult Swim Games' hit iOS game, Amateur Surgeon! Alan Probe must perform surgery on Baby Awoogah, a killer whale.

Many things they come into contact with (including each other) also gets germ-love, and become contagious. This continues until disease is spread throughout the islands. To make matters worse, the dead bodies hang around and the pygmies can’t be regenerated until you burn them on the campfire. Not our happiest update! \r\n\r\nBut wait, there’s hope! In just the next room, there is a Purification Fountain, that sparkles and shines with magical liquid that kills germs. Let the pygmies play in THAT fountain and they become Purified Pygmies that spread the anti-germ elixir to counteract the plague. But nothing is ever quite perfect, as purification comes with a price: obsessive germ phobia! Go away, microbes, go away! \r\n\r\nAlso included in this update is Aaron Blecha's Monster Pack!

To make matters worse, the dead bodies hang around and the pygmies can’t be regenerated until you burn them on the campfire. Not our happiest update!\n\nBut wait, there’s hope! In just the next room, there is a Purification Fountain, that sparkles and shines with magical liquid that kills germs. Let the pygmies play in THAT fountain and they become Purified Pygmies that spread the anti-germ elixir to counteract the plague. But nothing is ever quite perfect, as purification comes with a price: obsessive germ phobia! Go away, microbes, go away!\n\nAlso included in this update is Aaron Blecha's Monster Pack! One of our favorite artists made us a hilarious skin pack that is all monster, all the time! Turn the volcano into a lava-spewing Kraken, the meteor into a furry ball of horror, the T-Rex egg into a booger, the outhouse into a hungry monster (best not to think about that one too much), and much more! \n\nAnd don't forget the iOS5-powered Battle of the Gods Multiplayer!

But what they lack in counting skills they make up for in moves (like Jagger).  Because deeper in Apocalypse temple lies the Dance Room, where the Pygmies can either boogie on the dance floor or shake it in the go-go cage. There’s also some organic party balloons filled with a gas that the Pygmies breathe in order to sound like a certain \"David after Dentist\", the Youtube sensation: “I…I feel funny.”\n\nBut that’s not all! This update has our first mini-game since the Battle of the Gods. And you've probably already guessed that it’s a dancing game!  Place a Pygmy on the center platform to begin Dance Dance Execution. In a cross between Tap Tap Revenge and Dance Dance Revolution, you must tap the icons in time with the beat, while the Pygmy dances for his life...literally!  The dance loop, like the majority of the Pocket God loops, was composed by Grammy winner Christopher Tin, and features the voice talents of Brett Pels.\n\nTo celebrate our party update, our custom pack this time around is, what else? A Dance Pack! “Dance Pack Three” (99¢) features the Elaine Dance, Kony Guy Naked Dance, Hammer Time, Double Dream Hands, Bad Zombie, and the YMCA.   Also, we are proud to introduce “The Pygmy Theme,” written and performed by “Nerdcore” punk superstar Parry Gripp! Parry is not only known for leading the punk band  Nerf Herder, but he is also a solo artist that produces insanely catchy pop songs and YouTube videos.\n\nSpecial thanks go to Chris Kennet for the Dance Dance Execution poster and for animating the pygmy dances.\n\nThis is an all-star update, and we thank all our contributors at parrygripp.com, christophertin.com,davidafterdentist.com, brettpels.blogspot.com, and crikeyboy.blogspot.com!\n\n**********\n\nAnd don't forget the iOS5-powered Battle of the Gods Multiplayer!

The blocked door in the temple’s Chamber of Time has been opened, leading to the frightening Locust Room. Inside is an enormously disgusting Locust Queen who can birth a swarm of locusts, as long as she is given sustenance--and you can guess what her favorite food is!\n\nOnce the swarm is created, experiment to see what they can do.  For instance, they can harass Pygmies, toss ‘em around, slice 'em up “Fruit Ninja” style, or even turn pygmies into mutant locusts themselves. Weird!!\n\nFind all the locust interactions to earn the Locust God idol for Battle of the Gods.

I remember back in school we would wait every week for the new updates. Whenever a new update came out, my friends and I gathered together and played with all the new features. This game was great, so sad it's over. Re-downloaded it after years of not playing it, and it's cool to see a few new things. People are complaining that there aren't any updates, but they don't know that episode 47 was supposed to be the last one. They did episode 48 just because of popular demand. While I do wish there was a way to have alien pygmy's, werewolves, and female pygmy's, the game is packed with fun things to do. Maybe if the developers come back they can make 2 more episodes to finish it off? Just because 50 episodes is a lot cooler than 48 haha. Personally love the app, just kinda sad the graphics are the same and not high resolution like other apps. But I hope one day Bolt decides to finish up this app for good! And just one recommendation: I think Tom and Charlie should have a more distinct look, like Charlie should be in his tiger form permanently instead of just when slicing a Pygmy. I know the two characters are already somewhat distinct with their facial expressions, but it would still be cool.

I did ended the apocalypse a couple times over and SUN appeared at the end saying “Hey guys! What’s up?,” and then the alien got her and she screamed, then the alien ate her... First, it says *Go into story mode to see prophecy, okay, so I looked for “Story Mode” and found nothing! So I (once again) need to know WHO THE HECK SUN is! Also, why is her name in all caps? Not anything against the game, it’s just making my curiosity a murderer due to the mystery of this SUN Pygmy. I mean, I love the game, I still play it!

There are so many things to do and and so many things to see. And the best part is NO ADS! Now there is a part called the apocalypse. It is so fun! And there is fishing and water wings!

What happened to the updates every week? What happened to episode 48? What about the girl Pygmy? Aliens? Not sure how many people still play, but I'm betting if you removed the ads from this PAID for game, and finally started updating (at least once a month I mean seriously) you'd get a lot of players back.

But what they lack in counting skills they make up for in moves (like Jagger).  Because deeper in Apocalypse temple lies the Dance Room, where the Pygmies can either boogie on the dance floor or shake it in the go-go cage. There’s also some organic party balloons filled with a gas that the Pygmies breathe in order to sound like a certain \"David after Dentist\", the Youtube sensation: “I…I feel funny.”\n\nBut that’s not all!

In a cross between Tap Tap Revenge and Dance Dance Revolution, you must tap the icons in time with the beat, while the Pygmy dances for his life...literally!  The dance loop, like the majority of the Pocket God loops, was composed by Grammy winner Christopher Tin, and features the voice talents of Brett Pels.\n\nTo celebrate our party update, our custom pack this time around is, what else?
