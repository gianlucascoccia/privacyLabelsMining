With Myro:Home Helper you can enable capabilities like receiving push notifications, log data, expose items as HomeKit accessories and much more!\n\nExperience the ultimate in home automation control with Myro:Home for Leviton/HAI automation controllers. Myro:Home combines Leviton/HAI's proven home automation controllers with the latest features of iOS like FaceID/TouchID, Siri and WatchOS.  Finally, a user-friendly and convenient home automation interface for your Leviton/HAI system that is as usable from anywhere in the world as it is from the comfort of your couch.\n\nAnything from changing the thermostat setting to controlling lights or the security system is only a few taps away. The interface is customizable using a \"Favorites\" tab, where any controller object can be added for quick access and the \"Recents\" tab provides access to the last used items.  iBeacon and Location triggering is also possible.\n\nThe \"Status\" tab gives you a quick overview of the system's status including the security status for each area, the thermostat statuses, auxiliary sensor statuses, as well as any unread messages or zones that are not ready.  \n\nThe \"Security\" tab, conveniently organized by area allows you to view all zone statuses, bypass zones or arm/disarm the system (or set the mode for Lumina systems). The \"Security\" icon at the bottom of the screen displays a count of any insecure or bypassed zones.  A filter bar at the top also allows you to quickly find which zones are not ready.\n\nThe \"Climate\" tab provides a list of all configured thermostats and any auxiliary sensors, displaying their status, temperature and humidity levels. Tapping any thermostat allows you to have full control over its functionality including temperature and humidity setpoints, mode, fan and hold.\n\nThe \"Control\" tab allows you to control all of the configured lighting units in your home. \n\nThe \"Audio\" tab is displayed only on panels with an audio interface connected and allows control of all defined audio zones and sources, including any of its metadata!\n\nThe \"Messages\" tab provides a list of all system messages and allows you to display or acknowledge any unread messages. \n\nThe \"Cameras\" tab allows viewing of an unlimited number of MJPEG and RTSP capable cameras.  It can also access cameras with static JPEG images and automatically refresh them at 1 fps.\n\nThese are just a few of the things you can do with Myro:Home, download and try it all out for yourself!  \n\nSubscription Details:\n- Trial length is 14-days and a subscription can be paid monthly or on a yearly plan.\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nHardware Requirements: \nMyro:Home supports all recent Ethernet-enabled HAI home automation and security controllers, including: Lumina, Lumina Pro, OmniPro II, Omni IIe and Omni LTe. Controller firmware 3.5 or later is required.\n\nPrivacy:\nMyro Control, LLC does not use or collect any of your home usage data, private keys or connection details.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>After many years struggling with Haiku, Space, and kludgey HAI software, I finally made the purchase to my:ro home and I feel like an idiot for not doing so eons ago.  <br /><br />First of all, the app is outstanding and provides an amazing level of control and access that just has been absent from every other software program ever available for HAI systems. I often hated my HAI system because I struggled with these awful software programs to control it from my phone… And now I finally have an amazing app that does everything needed and I can hate HAI for the right reasons such as being tortured and killed by Leviton. Secondly, I just had my first support experience and it was world class outstanding! My profession is customer service leader ship so I know of what I speak, and if anything I am more hyper critical than the average consumer because this is my craft. The support provided when I reached to them was outstanding in every way: it was friendly, fleet, and accurate.<br /><br /> I left the contact feeling happy, and though the reason I initially hesitated to purchase the app is because I am resistant to subscription software models but this experience converted me and convinced me the subscription investment is worth every single penny.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is my third Omni-Pro controller in 20 years. Started out with earlier versions and have kept current. With Leviton’s purchase of HAI doubt we will see any new controllers until they drop the line. Sad, as HAI was a very innovative company. Leviton killed it. <br />But for those lucky to have this controller, Myro:Home is the very best mobile software to interface with this controller. Yes, you have to pay for it but it has been continually updated. Just did an update this month. Solid performance for a reasonable price. Worth every penny.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I am a home automation dealer and have purchased all of the HAI/Leviton apps (SnapLink, HAIKU, Space) and have the free version of this one. I love HAIKU and like what I see on this one but I can’t recommend this to my customers at the subscription price. It’s too expensive. From rumors I am hearing, the future of Omni controllers is uncertain as well. Leviton discontinued all HLC lighting, wireless products and EU version of controllers this past week. I am hearing other products including controllers may also be discontinued at the end of 2019. <br /><br />As for the app, I prefer to purchase it one time and not have it as a subscription. Major upgrades should be offered as a small cost to the original purchase price. I would recommend it to my customers as a $50 (maximum) one time purchase price.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Thanks for the feedback!  Pricing is always a difficult topic -- there is never a perfect price point for everyone. The reason for a subscription model is to keep development ongoing instead of just one and done.  We saw what happened to Haiku/Space.  New devices and iOS updates sometimes require significant efforts to support.  I hope you can recommend Myro:Home to your customers as our plans is to keep this going even long after Leviton/HAI stop supporting their products.  There is still a lot of life left in our panels -- Myro:Home can help keep them relevant.   More updates coming as well!</p>

It's with your support I can continue to improve this app.   It also seems like a lot of you seem to be running earlier firmware versions on your controllers than I thought, it's still recommended you update to the latest firmware, but understand that's not easy for some, so I added official support for panels running firmware 3.6 and later.   I also added an optimal firmware version indicator on the \"About\" tab.  If it displays a red \"!\", that means it's recommended you update your controller firmware (to at least 3.15).\n\nNEW FEATURES:\n• SECTION HEADERS: If a section is collapsed on Status, Room, Favorites, Security, and Climate screens, the setting will now be saved so the next time you open the app, it will remain collapsed.\n• ABOUT: Added an alert indicator next to firmware.  If it's visible on your system, it means your controller requires a firmware update for all the features to function properly.\n• CORE: Added support for controller firmware 3.6 and greater (still recommend you update your controller to at least firmware version 3.15 for best performance).

Tapping any thermostat allows you to have full control over its functionality including temperature and humidity setpoints, mode, fan and hold.\n\nThe \"Control\" tab allows you to control all of the configured lighting units in your home. \n\nThe \"Audio\" tab is displayed only on panels with an audio interface connected and allows control of all defined audio zones and sources, including any of its metadata!\n\nThe \"Messages\" tab provides a list of all system messages and allows you to display or acknowledge any unread messages. \n\nThe \"Cameras\" tab allows viewing of an unlimited number of MJPEG and RTSP capable cameras.

many years struggling with Haiku, Space, and kludgey HAI software, I finally made the purchase to my:ro home and I feel like an idiot for not doing so eons ago.  \n\nFirst of all, the app is outstanding and provides an amazing level of control and access that just has been absent from every other software program ever available for HAI systems. I often hated my HAI system because I struggled with these awful software programs to control it from my phone… And now I finally have an amazing app that does everything needed and I can hate HAI for the right reasons such as being tortured and killed by Leviton. Secondly, I just had my first support experience and it was world class outstanding! My profession is customer service leader ship so I know of what I speak, and if anything I am more hyper critical than the average consumer because this is my craft. The support provided when I reached to them was outstanding in every way: it was friendly, fleet, and accurate.\n\n I left the contact feeling happy, and though the reason I initially hesitated to purchase the app is because I am resistant to subscription software models but this experience converted me and convinced me the subscription investment is worth every single penny.","title":"Outstanding in every way!","userName":"JC Davis"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6064549206","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-11T21:58:15Z","rating":5,"review":"This is my third Omni-Pro controller in 20 years. Started out with earlier versions and have kept current. With Leviton’s purchase of HAI doubt we will see any new controllers until they drop the line. Sad, as HAI was a very innovative company. Leviton killed it. \nBut for those lucky to have this controller, Myro:Home is the very best mobile software to interface with this controller. Yes, you have to pay for it but it has been continually updated. Just did an update this month. Solid performance for a reasonable price.

Pricing is always a difficult topic -- there is never a perfect price point for everyone. The reason for a subscription model is to keep development ongoing instead of just one and done.

I hope you can recommend Myro:Home to your customers as our plans is to keep this going even long after Leviton/HAI stop supporting their products.

I love HAIKU and like what I see on this one but I can’t recommend this to my customers at the subscription price. It’s too expensive. From rumors I am hearing, the future of Omni controllers is uncertain as well. Leviton discontinued all HLC lighting, wireless products and EU version of controllers this past week. I am hearing other products including controllers may also be discontinued at the end of 2019. \n\nAs for the app, I prefer to purchase it one time and not have it as a subscription. Major upgrades should be offered as a small cost to the original purchase price.

The \"Security\" icon at the bottom of the screen displays a count of any insecure or bypassed zones.  A filter bar at the top also allows you to quickly find which zones are not ready.\n\nThe \"Climate\" tab provides a list of all configured thermostats and any auxiliary sensors, displaying their status, temperature and humidity levels. Tapping any thermostat allows you to have full control over its functionality including temperature and humidity setpoints, mode, fan and hold.\n\nThe \"Control\" tab allows you to control all of the configured lighting units in your home. \n\nThe \"Audio\" tab is displayed only on panels with an audio interface connected and allows control of all defined audio zones and sources, including any of its metadata!\n\nThe \"Messages\" tab provides a list of all system messages and allows you to display or acknowledge any unread messages. \n\nThe \"Cameras\" tab allows viewing of an unlimited number of MJPEG and RTSP capable cameras.

It's with your support I can continue to improve this app.   It also seems like a lot of you seem to be running earlier firmware versions on your controllers than I thought, it's still recommended you update to the latest firmware, but understand that's not easy for some, so I added official support for panels running firmware 3.6 and later.   I also added an optimal firmware version indicator on the \"About\" tab.
