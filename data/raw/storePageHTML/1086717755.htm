Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can press and hold onto the app icon to open a quick popout menu, you can swipe to the notification center to adjust the temperature on the Widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app lets you use Siri and Apple Watch to control your Nest Thermostat!<br />It also lets you see HomeKit Thermostat info on the Watch Complications.<br /><br />Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.<br /><br />＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).<br /><br />＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.<br />_____________<br /><br />• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It&#39;s all finally just one casual &quot;Hey Siri&quot; away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.<br />• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.<br />• On your iOS device you can press and hold onto the app icon to open a quick popout menu, you can swipe to the notification center to adjust the temperature on the Widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.<br />• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.<br /><br />The app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.<br /><br />The app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.<br /><br />Monitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.<br /><br />You can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as &quot;Start Heating&quot; or &quot;Make it Cooler&quot;. If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example &quot;Start Heating Upstairs&quot; or &quot;Start Cooling the Living Room&quot;.<br /><br />Visit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.<br /><br />Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.<br /><br />The app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.<br /><br />Beyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.<br /><br />While the app&#39;s minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don&#39;t show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.<br /><br />Thermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.<br />This app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc.</p>

Thanks to Alexander for helping troubleshoot this!<br /><br />Previous major updates:<br />＊ Added support for iOS/iPadOS 14 and watchOS 7.<br />＊ You can sign in with a Google or a Nest account to both the iOS app, and the Apple TV app.<br />＊ You can save both the Google account and Nest account API Key from the app menu. As usual, it&#39;s advisable to do this.<br />＊ Watch app can now display temperatures from Nest temperature sensors, and change the active sensor. To do this, press the watch screen firmly.<br />＊ Fan running time can now be configured in the app settings, independently for the iOS app, and the Watch app.<br />＊ HomeKit thermostat support added to the Apple TV version of the app.<br />＊ Tip Jar added to the app menu.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>***UPDATE*** <br />Marko replied to my response immediately, and knew the issue right away, I’m brand new to Nest Thermostat and Google changed a few things. Although he was unable to resolve it, he was very willing to refund me the purchased price. He gave me a very detailed reason why (the Google/Nest transition) it isn’t working. He is working on a solution to the problem, and hopefully will have it resolved soon. He was very pleasant to work with, and again, I love the Camera app he created. Just waiting for the bugs to be removed for me. Overall, great developer, very professional, and a pleasure to work with. (I would give a 5 because of his help, but the app still doesn’t work for me)<br /><br />Previous - When I try and log in through the app on my phone, using my nest account, it says I must use the main users account information, which I am. The camera app they have works well but this doesn’t work.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I started with a couple of Nest Thermostats in my home, but after Google stopped authorizing keys for new app integrations &amp; a need to access with some new software, decided to use Ecobee for the rest of my house &amp; will eventually replace Existing Nest with Ecobee. Unfortunately, I can not find any way to link Ecobee account to the app. I’ve searched the developers website and find plenty of information on linking to Nest, but not a word on Ecobee. If you are not supporting Ecobee, then remove it from the app name.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY, while the developer states that I only need to add the thermostats to my HomeKit configuration, then connect through the app, it doesn’t work. I already had all of my thermostats connected to HomeKit. I connected to HomeKit, when I installed each Thermostat. (They all show up in the Home app, along with the remote sensors) The ThermoWatch app doesn’t give me an option of connecting to my HomeKit Devices, the closest option is to Authorize my AppleTV (HomeKit Hub). That doesn’t work either. Those instructions refer to connecting to a Nest Thermostat. Running the AppleTV app, when selecting this option on the phone, doesn’t do anything at all.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi Wulfeman. The Ecobee thermostats are supported in this app when they are added to your HoneKit setup. Then you just choose the “Connect to your HomeKit Thermostat” from the app’s first screen, and they will show up in the app. You can then control them from the iOS app, the Widget, Apple Watch, and Apple TV.<br />Please note that with this app you can choose to control Nest thermostats, or HomeKit thermostats, but not both at the same time.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The app is great! The app is very functional and gives me a great status view and control of my two Nest Thermostats! Some of my favorite features are: 1) the iOS widget provides me a fast way to control the temp, home/away status, humidity, and ambient temperature for my upstairs and downstairs thermostats. 2) Apple Watch widget gives me the same control as the iOS widget but it also has a GREAT complication showing me the cool/heat status, on/off status, ambient temperature and humidity. [the Nest Watch app doesn’t have this]. 3) tvOS app also gives me all the above control on my AppleTV [the Nest TV app doesn’t have this-in fact, you can’t control your thermostats on the AppleTV Nest app. It’s only for the Nest Cam].  <br /><br />With all that said, I’ve reached out to the developer a few times to provide suggestions and issues and they have been VERY responsive! I would recommend this to anyone who wants a really cool control and UI for their Nest Thermostats.</p>

The app will set your home into Away state (which can set the thermostat into Eco mode) as soon as the phone exits the defined perimeter - and back into Home state when you get back in.

Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can press and hold onto the app icon to open a quick popout menu, you can swipe to the notification center to adjust the temperature on the Widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest.

Nest thermostat has two visual modes, so to speak. One, called “Farsight”, is active when you move around the thermostat, but are not close to it. This mode lets you show the weather, time, or the room temperature. The other mode becomes active when you get close to the thermostat, and that mode always shows the target temperature in the middle, and it lets you adjust it.\nSimilarly, in this app, even though it can’t match the “Farsight” setting from the thermostat, you can choose what to show on the app complications on the watch face. You can do this if you launch the app called “Watch” on your phone, then scroll down to Thermo Watch and tap on it. You can choose between Ambient Temperature, Target temperature and Humidity. However, when you launch the app, the big number in the middle has to be the target temperature, while you’re adjusting it, much like on the thermostat itself. Note that there is a small dot around the thermostat ring, which indicates the ambient temperature, so you can easily see its relation to the target temperature in the app. I understand that it’s nice to have a large ambient temperature number displayed, and you can actually have it on some of the watch faces, especially on the X-Large watch face.\nYou can contact me at marconelly@gmail.com and I can explain how to set this up in more detail, so you can have the app that will be better suited to you.","modified":"2020-06-13T01:12:01Z"},"rating":4,"review":"I would like to see an update where you can have options to show different displays on app. So currently when I look at my nest display in the app, the screen displays the cooling point set temp and not the current room temp. I know it shows the current room temp underneath, but being able to display it on the nest icon in the app would be nice. Also, just if you could make it mirror my actual nest display. So for example you can see the digital clock if your nest has been set to this for the display. Even better would be an option to set your display in the app and have it change on the nest at home or even an option to change the display in the app without it changing the display on your actual nest.

Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can press and hold onto the app icon to open a quick popout menu, you can swipe to the notification center to adjust the temperature on the Widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."},"versionHistory":[{"versionDisplay":"15.5","releaseNotes":"＊ Home Screen Widget on iOS 14.\n＊ Support for the newest Nest Thermostat.\n＊ Fix for the Watch app authorization problem that has affected some users.\n＊ Temperature sensors should now be visible in the Watch app for all users.

The app will set your home into Away state (which can set the thermostat into Eco mode) as soon as the phone exits the defined perimeter - and back into Home state when you get back in. You will receive notifications that confirm the Home/Away state has been successfully set, when these events happen. You can set the perimeter to be anything from very small, to several miles in radius. Use this feature if you are for any reason not happy with the similar functionality provided by the main Nest app.  Note that if someone else stays at home when you exit the perimeter, your home will soon go back into Home state, when thermostat picks up motion activity inside the home.\n\n＊ Each of your Nest homes can have one geofence. To set up fences, press the menu button in the top left, and select the option from the menu. Make sure to \"Always Allow\" location updates, as geofencing won't work otherwise. The app uses your location only to change the Home/Away state, and never sends your location anywhere.
