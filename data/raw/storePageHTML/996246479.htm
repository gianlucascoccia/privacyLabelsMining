      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I downloaded this app because Netflix was taking off one of my all time favorite shows, The Tudors. I like to go back and rewatch this show now and then and was happy that it is available on here as it is an original Showtime series. I am also seeing other shows on here  that look interesting. This app seems to run very smoothly, which I greatly appreciate! However I was wondering if you can put a rewind 10 sec and fast forward 10 seconds instead of the 30 sec rewind. Don’t get me wrong, I am happy to have it but sometimes if I missed something and want to quickly go back 30 seconds seems kinda long to me. Would greatly appreciate you guys considering this and thank you for a great app!!☺️👍🏼</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Ok so this app is just out right terrible. Showtime its self is a good streaming service with a great selection of content that is not the issue. The issue is with the design of the app, I subscribe to most of the streaming services available and Showtimes app is by far the worst. Now I feel this is a huge shame as Showtimes content with verity and just out right quality shows is one of if not the best streaming service for TV seasons etc. Just the navigation and design of the app puts it down at the bottom of all the streaming services. At first I thought it was me and I was just missing some menu or button but after asking my family and others I know they all had the same problems. Now I’m sure when you eventually figure out how to perform simple tasks on the app then what I’m saying would seem silly, but that is the issue after 4 weeks using the app I am still unable to skip backward 2 episodes, or buying up the list of episodes for instance. I genuinely went on to my local university to see if there was a coarse or something Showtime expect you to take to be able to navigate the app, I have no issue performing any functions when watching on different platforms e.g. Roku threw my television but the Apple app for me with a masters in software engineering, its just to complicated to use.</p>

Showtime its self is a good streaming service with a great selection of content that is not the issue. The issue is with the design of the app, I subscribe to most of the streaming services available and Showtimes app is by far the worst. Now I feel this is a huge shame as Showtimes content with verity and just out right quality shows is one of if not the best streaming service for TV seasons etc. Just the navigation and design of the app puts it down at the bottom of all the streaming services. At first I thought it was me and I was just missing some menu or button but after asking my family and others I know they all had the same problems. Now I’m sure when you eventually figure out how to perform simple tasks on the app then what I’m saying would seem silly, but that is the issue after 4 weeks using the app I am still unable to skip backward 2 episodes, or buying up the list of episodes for instance. I genuinely went on to my local university to see if there was a coarse or something Showtime expect you to take to be able to navigate the app, I have no issue performing any functions when watching on different platforms e.g. Roku threw my television but the Apple app for me with a masters in software engineering, its just to complicated to use.","title":"Terrible","userName":"isk-lilly"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6656513119","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-11-17T19:45:48Z","developerResponse":{"id":19260999,"body":"We appreciate your interest in SHOWTIME and your suggestion to improve the SHOWTIME app. Your comments regarding content navigation have been forwarded internally for consideration when making app enhancements in the future.

If you want to watch a series from the beginning (e.g. Dexter) there’s no way to add the show to a watch list. Every time you log in you have to go to the menu, series, scroll through all shows until you find it, find the season you want (newest first, of course), then the episode. You get to do this every time you log in. If you watch more than one show, you do it for that show too. This is such a fundamental blunder in design that it makes me angry each time I use it. It is mind bogglingly bad. There’s not even a search function to enter the name of the show. You can’t even pick up where you left off because if you go to menu, recently watched it restarts the last episode you watched.  The only possible explanation I have for this poorly designed app is that it was created by someone that does not watch television and doesn’t understand how tv shows work.","title":"Navigation is awful","userName":"Eremalla"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5783851924","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-09T02:44:44Z","developerResponse":{"id":14596231,"body":"We appreciate your interest in SHOWTIME and your suggestion to improve the SHOWTIME app. Your comments regarding content navigation have been forwarded internally for consideration when making app enhancements in the future.

I usually just missed the last 10 seconds of dialogue, and if you really need 30, hitting a 10-second button three times is simple. So a smaller increment please!\n\nHaving a forward-10-seconds button to undo that would be nice too. \n\nI do like the easy on/off close captioning button, though only seems to work for English because it doesn't seem to have a language selector. But for me, a native English speaker, being able to turn it on and off without disrupting play is awesome, and it's the first app I've seen with this. \n\nHaving an option to turn CC on only for a back-10-seconds playback would be cool though, where it turns on just until you get back to the spot where you originally hit the button. \n\nOverall, the app does the job. But the meager playback controls are probably the most frustrating I've found in a video app.","title":"Video works well, playback controls lacking","userName":"computageek"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6654449041","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-11-17T07:08:51Z","developerResponse":{"id":19261113,"body":" If you need assistance canceling your SHOWTIME subscription, we can help.

I like the live TV feature on the Roku app.  I’m not a fan of the obvious political agenda, particularly the documentary on Ronald Reagan, which is a hatchet job depicting him as a buffoon with no mind of his own, who let Nancy run the show.  I didn’t agree with his politics, but he was in office over 30 years ago and long since deceased, so maybe we should let the man Rest In Peace.  I have seen other programming on your network that obviously leans in a certain direction.  Whether I agree or not, it is not a very balanced approach.  \n\nI’m not renewing because there isn’t enough to watch and because of the app itself — no play from beginning feature and a difficult to use rewind button.

I ended up having to watch the show on my tablet at home smh. The layout is very poorly created and there’s so many steps just to play a certain episode of a show.

When you log into the app with your tv subscriber, it only keeps you logged in for a limited time, even when you’re signed into that tv provider with your iPhone. Very annoying to constantly have to re-enter your credentials.\n\n2. Would be nice if the app auto played the next episode of a show. Also it would be nice if, similar to Netflix, you could pick up right where you left off in an episode/show from the home screen. But you have to go back into search, click through etc, to go to the last episode you watched and continue from there.\n\n3. I used to watch shows from the app on my tv via my chrome cast, but for the past few months, there is no longer an option to cast from the app. I’ve troubleshooted, downloaded the latest app version, etc. yet nothing. All of my other streaming apps continue to work with chrome cast. This is a major drawback as this has resulted in my no longer using the app since this issue started (for at least 5 months now).
