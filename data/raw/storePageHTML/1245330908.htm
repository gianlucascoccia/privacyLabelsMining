      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>My main purpose for this app is the ability to cast my iTunes movies to a chromecast, which works well. I also like the idea of combining the many digital libraries in one place. My only issue is I can’t get all of my iTunes purchases to appear in my library. Hopefully this gets fixed and the app gets polished to the point it becomes a go to app.<br /><br />Edit: I’m now learning, from developer response, not all movie studios/titles are supported. This is unfortunate, and perhaps this could be denoted more clearly, but it’s certainly better than none. This may very well be noted, but I’m one of the many who glosses through all the disclaimers/alerts. <br /><br />What would probably be the best solution is to load titles that aren’t supported faded back in a section under available movies. This way users can see clearly which movies are currently available from studios.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>UPDATE:<br />I’ve received responses from the developer. They assured me that the movies in my account were fine. I updated iTunes on my computer, updated my phone to the latest iOS, and did an app update. I still receive the error, and Now there is a (19) at the end of it. HOWEVER, if I tap OK, and then tap Play on the movie again, it will start to play. I’m changing my rating form one star to three. I’m very happy that the movies will play, but it’s somewhat annoying having to get them to play. Thanks for working through the issues!<br /><br />Because of Disney movies anywhere shutting down I was forced to go with this app.  At first things appeared to be an order and was working properly. In the recent weeks or months every time I try to play a video that worked fine on my Disney movies anywhere account or this account now all of a sudden are giving me a licensing issue error. I have paid for the movies that are giving the licensing error.  Then a bunch of random movies showed up in my account but I did not pay for.  It’s not easy to explain to a four year old that something that was working fine is no longer working when we’re on a long car ride. I have opened a ticket through the app. We’ll see what happens.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Let’s start with “AT LAST”. I paid for these movies and FINALLY some genius realized it profits everyone to let me use them on whichever device, whichever media I choose. No more separate download sources depending on the studio. No more telling my wife to make sure the box has the iTunes logo. We’re done here. Prime Video acts like I bought it through them, so my LG smart tv and kids kindles can watch them. iTunes acts like I bought it through them, so all my iOS devices can watch them. Across all capable devices I can download them. So my kids don’t have to waste my limited DSL bandwidth (I live in the sticks, back off). When I do stream through the app or otherwise it’s flawless. Honestly, this is what living in the 21st should be. Yeah, I said it. <br /><br />Oh by the way, the app UI is well thought-out and intuitive. Really well done. I honestly don’t understand what is holding Paramount back from buying-in, but they’re morons for doing so. <br /><br />If MA is looking for investors or anything, I’d sign up. I’ll go door-to-door. Probably not door-to-door, I don’t really like people, but I do like this app... a lot.</p>

This may very well be noted, but I’m one of the many who glosses through all the disclaimers/alerts. \n\nWhat would probably be the best solution is to load titles that aren’t supported faded back in a section under available movies.

Anyway....my issue that I had was a movie that was eligible and that I had purchased was not syncing from my iTunes onto MA. Toy story 3. Toy Story 1 \u0026 2 transferred over but 3 did not. I tried to log out and log back in. I also tried to unlink iTunes and reconnect to see if it’ll refresh and sync again....but nothing. Finally I contacted them via the contact us chat through the app. I let them know what was going on and sent the message. 2 MINUTES later I received a message saying that they refreshed it from their end and hopefully that fixed any issue I was having. IT DID! I was so happy. 1 minute later I came on here to give them a review and rate them 5 stars just for that lol good job MA!!

Well, it’s been over a week and they are missing the 3 movies exclusive to that app, but they did get the purchases from iTunes/Amazon.  It seems to be a problem with the movies the Disney Anywhere app gave me for free so I guess I can’t keep them on the new app? Anyways, they’re at least in my iTunes account so I can still watch them there, it just defeats the point if they’re not all accessible from this app like advertised. But in all fairness they did give me some new movies with this app so it’s not a total waste.\n\nMovies Anywhere won’t let me view my movies from my from Disney Movies Anywhere account. Each time I attempt to import my movies, it tells me the movies have already been imported for my account, but then shows no movies. Still watching my movies on Disney Movies Anywhere, hopefully they will fix this problem before that app closes in February. This one is also not as easy to maneuver through in comparison to the Disney Movies Anywhere.

He started to watch one at home minutes before getting into the car. It was good for 30 minutes. \nAfter half an hour application stopped and gave message about not having any offline copies. So long trip was with no movies. When we arrived to destination I’ve checked the app: it asked me to sign in again, as soon as I did - movies appeared. In several days my son was flying with my wife, I’ve checked the app and movies were there. They boarded the plane - movies were gone. I’ve checked later iPad (when it had WiFi connection to internet) the app asked me to sign in again and after that movies appeared. \nApplication has deep issues with authentication and needs internet connection to work. In case if I want to watch purchased movie when offline - hold off your expectations. \nMore fixes and improvements are needed.

The only control they give you is using the film’s rating. This would be fine if you agreed with the rating system of the movie industry, or if that system was applied equally over its history. But that’s not always the case. For example, I have given my kids access to G and PG rated movies, but right now I’m debating whether or not I should buy Beetlejuice, because I know it’ll show up under their account and I clearly don’t want them to see this movie. But I have no way to select specific films I want to show up in their account. I don’t feel like this would be a hard thing to change, and I hope they consider it.\n\nI also hope they consider a better way to provide feedback, because currently I don’t see any, and the service has no presence on social media.","title":"Good but could be better","userName":"Dignan17"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6215175390","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-19T05:03:38Z","rating":5,"review":"I was a but skeptical when obtaining this app considering that I would divulge access to my accounts to an app that was relatively newly created. But the advantage has been overwhelming, considering that whatever was purchased on any store ex: Apple Store connected to app didn't require me to shell an additional $20 in another Microsoft Store for the same movie. The only item that seems to affect true interconnected services is that movie labels will be concerned about not obtaining sufficient gains and someone foolishly purchase 1 movie multiple times. Its 2020 get with the program and the interconnected world is becoming more of a reality.

This may be a potentially convenient service, but if you ever need support, you’re out of luck. I’ll be deleting the app and my account.\n\n11/12 Update: My first attempt to reach support was via chat. The automated system asked me to detail my issue, which I did. To prevent a lengthy wait, the system invited me to transfer my chat into an email support ticket that would retain all the info I had already input. That would have been a terrific feature, except the email I ultimately received made no reference to the info I had already input and asked all over again for details about my issue. Although frustrated, I complied...which launched my series of “no reply other than auto responder emails.” While I appreciate the suggestion to use phone support, I’m not sure I’m prepared to put any more energy into this app. So, for now, my rating stands.","title":"No Support Whatsoever","userName":"mdg8"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2176545176","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-02-07T05:44:07Z","rating":5,"review":"I can’t say enough good things about this app.  First off I don’t have a technical cell in my brain!

I am in the states now for a while and couldn’t figure out how to get my movies from phone to my T.V.  This app has completely solved my problem.  After trying for 3 weeks to figure something out I ran across this app and in no time have all my purchased shows in 1 spot. It was super easy to get going (don’t know the technical jargon) and in minutes was watching a movie. Thank you so very much for this terrific app. I can’t rave enough about its ease of use etc..
