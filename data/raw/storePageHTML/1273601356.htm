      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>By first opening the app there are specific types of problems (mental or physical) to talk about in group chats. You can add more specific types of chats and people can join. There are ‘guides’ who monitor the conversation, keep it going and will talk to you with others in the chat and even direct message you if you don’t want all people to see. Even though the live chats are about specific things you can chat a guide or any person in general that’s willing to talk about any situation you might have. <br />Under another tab there are various subjects such as depression, MS, anorexia, child birth and even more mainstream things such as graduating from college, loosing a job, divorce and breakups that give some good advice (I’m bad at explaining just check it out for yourself). These really target specific problems. <br />I suggest everyone get this app. The only thing I don’t like is the Pinterest looking theme under the specific tabs and I also wish they could tell you what the specific thing is about Incase you just want to learn about it (but I guess part of the app is defining that for yourself per your own experience) <br />Overall great.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>If you are feeling alone, if you are in pain, if you need a loving heart... Wisdo is your community. Wisdo is love, family, listening, and everything community means. By creating connections, whether they are one time interactions or life long friends, whether they are exactly like you or someone you never thought you would get to know, Wisdo creates strength. A platform for the messy, uncomfortable, and embarrassing, this place is full of people radiating positivity just waiting to lift you up. Even when the person you are connecting with can&#39;t provide an perfect answer or say the perfect thing, Wisdo is always, always, always a safe place to just listen and accept with open arms. Because of this place, I went from being depressed and lost to feeling completely supported and knowing I want to help others through counseling, just like the counseling I got here. You deserve all of the support and community that Wisdo gives freely to you. Join in the conversation! We can&#39;t wait to meet you ♥️</p>

Wisdo is a safe community and is kept that way, by Guides who explain rules of conduct, give a heads up to those breaching the rules and only if all else fails, take action.

New on Wisdo - Goals Progression and Success Stories \n\nAs you join Wisdo you are invited not only to share what you've \"been through\" and where you \"are now\", so we can connect you with the right person at the right time. \n\nWe also ask you to choose up to three life Goals that we can help you achieve. Since launching this empowering feature we've seen people making extraordinary progress which is why, this week, we're adding a new Goal Tracking layer that will ask you if you've achieved your goal or are still working towards it.\n\nWhy? because we care. \n\nIf you haven't achieved your Goal yet, we will work extra hard to get you to where you want to go.\n\nIf you have achieved your Goal, thanks to Wisdo and our community of peers and coaches, we will invite you to share a \"Success Story\" so others can find inspiration and hope in your words and journey. \n\nAfter all, we all need someone to rely on as we make our way in the world. Why not be that person?\n\n2. New on Wisdo: 1:1 Coaching Sessions \n\nWisdo already offers 2 weekly Group Coaching sessions to every new member, included in the price of your monthly or yearly membership.\n\nImagine: 96 Group Coaching sessions for just the price of 2 cups of coffee a month. Incredible, no? :)\n\nThis week we're adding a whole new layer of support, for those moments when you need a 1:1 setting to really get to where you want to: namely, 1:1 Coaching Sessions with vetted coaches who have specifically earned experience in the area of life where you lack support and mentorship in most. \n\nFor now, 1:1 Coaching Sessions are not included in the price of your monthly membership and are an extra layer of support, but most of our coaches do offer introductory 30 minute 1:1 sessions for free.\n\nWhy? what, you forgot already?\n\nBecause we care.\n\nRemember: We are here for you 24/7. Join us. \n\nWith love, \n\nTeam Wisdo\nwearewisdo@wisdo.com","releaseDate":"2020-09-08"},{"versionDisplay":"2.58","releaseNotes":"** IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT ** \nTo ease the transition from COVID-19 lockdown to recovery for 25 million college students around the world, Wisdo is free in the next 6 months to college students with .edu or ac.uk emails.

New on Wisdo: 1:1 Coaching Sessions \n\nWisdo already offers 2 weekly Group Coaching sessions to every new member, included in the price of your monthly or yearly membership.\n\nImagine: 96 Group Coaching sessions for just the price of 2 cups of coffee a month. Incredible, no? :)\n\nThis week we're adding a whole new layer of support, for those moments when you need a 1:1 setting to really get to where you want to: namely, 1:1 Coaching Sessions with vetted coaches who have specifically earned experience in the area of life where you lack support and mentorship in most. \n\nFor now, 1:1 Coaching Sessions are not included in the price of your monthly membership and are an extra layer of support, but most of our coaches do offer introductory 30 minute 1:1 sessions for free.\n\nWhy? what, you forgot already?\n\nBecause we care.\n\nRemember: We are here for you 24/7. Join us. \n\nWith love, \n\nTeam Wisdo\nwearewisdo@wisdo.com","releaseDate":"2020-08-12"},{"versionDisplay":"2.57.1","releaseNotes":"Cherished Wisdonians,\n\nAnother week, another update released to help of you safely and quickly connect to that special person - who has walked in your shoes and is eager to help you thrive.\n\nAs usual, our team has spent time zeroing on bugs that needed squashing and performance upgrades that were called for.\n\nFinding someone to learn from, whom has been there - is now even easier.\n\nWe are here for you always.\n\nTeam Wisdo\n\nwearewisdo@wisdo.com","releaseDate":"2020-08-04"},{"versionDisplay":"2.57","releaseNotes":"Cherished Wisdonians,\n\nAnother week, another update released to help of you safely and quickly connect to that special person - who has walked in your shoes and is eager to help you thrive.\n\nAs usual, our team has spent time zeroing on bugs that needed squashing and performance upgrades that were called for.\n\nFinding someone to learn from, whom has been there - is now even easier.\n\nWe are here for you always.\n\nTeam Wisdo\n\nwearewisdo@wisdo.com","releaseDate":"2020-07-28"},{"versionDisplay":"2.56","releaseNotes":"Cherished Wisdonians,\n\nAnother week, another update released to help of you safely and quickly connect to that special person - who has walked in your shoes and is eager to help you thrive.\n\nAs usual, our team has spent time zeroing on bugs that needed squashing and performance upgrades that were called for.\n\nFinding someone to learn from, whom has been there - is now even easier.\n\nWe are here for you always.\n\nTeam Wisdo\n\nwearewisdo@wisdo.com","releaseDate":"2020-07-19"},{"versionDisplay":"2.55","releaseNotes":"** IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT ** \nTo ease the transition from COVID-19 lockdown to recovery for 25 million college students around the world, Wisdo is free in the next 6 months to college students with .edu or ac.uk emails.

You can add more specific types of chats and people can join. There are ‘guides’ who monitor the conversation, keep it going and will talk to you with others in the chat and even direct message you if you don’t want all people to see. Even though the live chats are about specific things you can chat a guide or any person in general that’s willing to talk about any situation you might have. \nUnder another tab there are various subjects such as depression, MS, anorexia, child birth and even more mainstream things such as graduating from college, loosing a job, divorce and breakups that give some good advice (I’m bad at explaining just check it out for yourself). These really target specific problems. \nI suggest everyone get this app. The only thing I don’t like is the Pinterest looking theme under the specific tabs and I also wish they could tell you what the specific thing is about Incase you just want to learn about it (but I guess part of the app is defining that for yourself per your own experience) \nOverall great.

There shouldn’t ever be a reason you should have to subscribe or make payments for these services. I understand that it costs money and time and effort and all that Jazz to make apps. However, this is free, unsolicited advice from everyday people. Not professionals. There may be some spread throughout the app but this is the generalized public. This is to get help in a way that is supposed to be more comfortable for people. Statistically speaking, people who live in the “middle class” and lower have higher rates of mental illness and higher rates of suicide. The lower you go in poverty level, the higher and higher suicide rates climb and the higher percentage of mental illness. I’m more than willing to bet that a fairly decent amount of people, probably 80% minimum struggle financially and are just trying to get help in one of the only ways they can afford to. I would highly HIGHLY suggest revisiting this option. I know that I can’t afford that extra money right now as every penny counts. Those who read this review it is a great app. Take advantage of the free trial. It’s worth it. But I would suggest writing low star reviews and hopefully the people who made this app will reconsider their fees.","title":"Help shouldn’t Cost","userName":"SkeletonQueen29"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3506415300","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-12-08T05:55:54Z","rating":5,"review":"This is one of the best apps I’ve ever used first off let me tell you, you need to be 17 and up because that’s the rules.

That being said: this app is not user-friendly; when I click ‘view more replies’ I constantly receive a message with a red bar that says ‘something is wrong’. Additionally, notifications can be slow to appear, and the chat rooms are difficult to keep up with. Part of this results from the largest groups being ridiculously large, but also: when you click to read the chat history, you often can’t find the newest notification that showed up in the preview screen. The timeline ‘trending’ feature also constantly shows the same posts/doesn’t refresh correctly. Please fix the numerous bugs in this app. \n\nLastly: many people try to use this app as a dating site. It’s incredibly irritating, and could potentially be harmful to those seeking help when feeling especially vulnerable.

I left and tried installing it 6-8 months later. Anyways I don’t understand where you are going with payments. I’m not sure if the system has changed since I can’t view unless I pay. I would not use this app anymore if I have to pay to help other people through your app. That seems pretty low, and definitely not something I ever want to be a part of. It doesn’t align with my morals. I hope the people who create groups get paid for it and everyone who actually helps people. I’m sorry but this feels like a slap in the face. I wish you luck in whatever it is you’re trying to achieve, sort of. There is a lack of transparency with categories being locked. It’s as big of a mess as my review because the lack of transparency in the app doesn’t allow me to properly rate Wisdo unless I pay. Clearly I won’t be doing that and will search for better alternatives. They are out there.","title":"I was a committed helper","userName":"Croyyyyyy"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2342087331","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-03-24T18:25:31Z","developerResponse":{"id":2922186,"body":"Dear ggddl - thank you for this super helpful comment.

Every single thing I posted was ignored. It just caused me more anxiety because I was already anxious enough about posting it and then literally no one would reply. Some of the guides don’t really seem to care about everyone and only pick specific people to interact with. I also believe that letting people who have been through things help others who are dealing with the same thing is a great idea, however, putting thousands of people together that are all currently dealing with anxiety or depression while they’re trying to help each other isn’t that great. It’s like the blind leading the blind. That’s probably why there are programs that pair someone with someone who has dealt with it or understands and can give advice, rather than someone currently dealing with it. Great idea but not executed properly. This app just caused me more anxiety due to the fact that no one ever replied to me.","title":"Did more harm than good","userName":"ggddl"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2917539791","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-07-16T13:37:06Z","developerResponse":{"id":4269597,"body":"Dear Elliewhonow - these types of reviews are what helps us keep going full speed ahead, until our mission is fulfilled.

Now, I am honored to have become a guide, helping to guide conversation and keep Wisdo a safe place. Wisdo was created and is run with love and nothing but good intentions for the people who use it, and it shows. It is a place for anyone who needs someone to be a friend or who has ever needed someone to listen and support them. Wisdo is a place where you can seek advice and support from someone who has “been there,” wherever “there” is and where you can share your own insights, joys, and triumphs. The app is divided into “experiences” such as coping with depression, eating disorders, lgbt+, college, chronic pain, cancer, going vegan, learning mindfulness, coping with loss, and so so many more. Plus, new experiences are always being added! I highly recommend this app.","title":"Wonderful App","userName":"Elliewhonow"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1482535791","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"Wisdo Monthly

New on Wisdo - Goals Progression and Success Stories \n\nAs you join Wisdo you are invited not only to share what you've \"been through\" and where you \"are now\", so we can connect you with the right person at the right time. \n\nWe also ask you to choose up to three life Goals that we can help you achieve. Since launching this empowering feature we've seen people making extraordinary progress which is why, this week, we're adding a new Goal Tracking layer that will ask you if you've achieved your goal or are still working towards it.\n\nWhy? because we care. \n\nIf you haven't achieved your Goal yet, we will work extra hard to get you to where you want to go.\n\nIf you have achieved your Goal, thanks to Wisdo and our community of peers and coaches, we will invite you to share a \"Success Story\" so others can find inspiration and hope in your words and journey. \n\nAfter all, we all need someone to rely on as we make our way in the world. Why not be that person?\n\n2. New on Wisdo: 1:1 Coaching Sessions \n\nWisdo already offers 2 weekly Group Coaching sessions to every new member, included in the price of your monthly or yearly membership.\n\nImagine: 96 Group Coaching sessions for just the price of 2 cups of coffee a month. Incredible, no? :)\n\nThis week we're adding a whole new layer of support, for those moments when you need a 1:1 setting to really get to where you want to: namely, 1:1 Coaching Sessions with vetted coaches who have specifically earned experience in the area of life where you lack support and mentorship in most. \n\nFor now, 1:1 Coaching Sessions are not included in the price of your monthly membership and are an extra layer of support, but most of our coaches do offer introductory 30 minute 1:1 sessions for free.\n\nWhy? what, you forgot already?\n\nBecause we care.\n\nRemember: We are here for you 24/7.

And we love you, Team Wisdo.\n\nFriends of Wisdo, \n\nNeed some new friends you can rely on? suffering sleepless nights and looking for purpose and support?\n\nYou've come to the right place: the #1 online community today to find peers and coaches who've \"been there\", and work towards social wellness. \n\n1. New on Wisdo - After subscribing, connect to your support network \n\nWisdo's mission is to surround people with others who can make them feel good about themselves and work towards their life goals.\n\nTo make this even easier, once choosing to Subscribe to our community - you will now be matched with supportive people who share your life paths. Simply choose whom you want to connect to based on their helpfulness bio and what you share in life. \n\nThey will be notified - that you've joined and would like to start an empowering connection.\n\n2. New on the Wisdo homepage - build you Support Network. Every day \n\nSo you've subscribed to Wisdo. Yay! you've been matched with supportive peers and booked to two Coaching Sessions a week (!), the equivalent of thousands of dollars of worth anywhere else.\n\nHowever, since we can never have enough supportive people in our lives - we've added a new section to the homepage where you will always find people that you'd benefit from connecting to. Every day.\n\nJust click on any of the beautiful tiles and chose to connect to that person, or else say \"hi\" and start conversing!\n\n3. A new gallery of life experiences - College Life\n\nIt isn't a secret that college students are hurting now. If you're looking at challenges such as Reducing debt, Finding a dream job or Academic stress - look no further. Wisdo can connect you to other students who are going through the same things, as well as professional coaches who can help you take these experiences head on. \n\nRemember: We are here for you always.
