      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This game takes the sandbox Genre into a whole new level between how beautiful the game is and the way that everything in racks you can definitely tell there’s a lot of time put into this app I’ve played several if not all of the other sand box games in the App Store and none of them really compared to the amount of satisfaction of this game gives youThere’s so many different things that you could potentially do between building civilizations just to watch some crumble or even setting up a 4 way rumble between races to see who would win and so many other things from turning all populations in the zombies making a thrive in civilization the options are so vast and with the right additions this game shouLd be on pc and console <br /><br />But...if there were things I would ask for would maybe be the option to advanceCivilizations technologically wise you know like cars planes boats or even like horseback stuff like this would help bring the immersion factor into the game may even make it to where they can slowly after many many years evolved into modern cities along with military and police medical I know it sounds like a lot but from what you’ve done you pretty much made the steppingstones for the simple upgrade I have no doubt that these things will be able to be added especially with the creativity that the developer has shown  I think this could be the absolute best sand game ever add a few tweaks my dude your doing great so far .<br /><br />Thanks-</p>

</h3>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This game has so far been really awesome and I can tell this game has the potential of having really cool things added to it. With the addition of boats this opens the door for awesome possibilities to come to the future but first I want to address an idea I came up with that would be cool for all aspects of the game. I know this idea I’m about to say will take a lot of time to make but I think would be overall really interesting and that is a learning system for the Ai. So for example a civilization is just created and at first they are really primitive and stupid but the more the people do the more the Ai learns so like say that civilization wants to attack another but a tactic isn’t working and they keep getting killed the Ai would think of an different plan of attack and maybe try a different angle, send more fighters, etc and the same idea can be implemented for a defensive stand point or really anything. After a lot of in game  years have passed that one civilization will be very smart and wise and a hard opponent to defeat. I came up with this idea when one civilization kept attacking the other but the defending civilization would destroy the Attacking then right after they did that they would swim across the channel and do the same tactic as their enemy and they kept doing that back and forth for so long and without my intervention it would’ve stayed like that. Just a thought for the future I’m sure you have your hands full but something to think about!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Love this game. Plain and simple. It has awesome features that no other game in the genre has. However, if it&#39;s possible, I&#39;d love to see more things added to this game. Mainly just more powers/creatures/ect. I&#39;d also love to see the whole colony system expanded on. Maybe add more features to that aspect specifically. Maybe some Heroes live in the colonies who go out and adventure or something. Animals should be able to breed so that you don&#39;t have a limited supply and have to spawn more of them. Also, it&#39;d be cool to see some kind of automated spawner for hostile mobs. And maybe those hostile mobs also make little civilizations of their own, just to add another enemy for the races to fight. Imagine being able to spawn dragon eggs that start out as baby dragons who simply hunt for food, giving time for the humans to build up their defenses against the inevitable dragon attack as they grow and breed. It&#39;d be cool if the humans could tame passive mobs like horses or dogs. Or for that matter, if they could tame dragons and fly around with them. Maybe nerf some of the hostile mobs so that spawning more than a few doesn&#39;t devestate an entire colony. <br /><br />Anyway, I understand the difficulty in making things like these so I&#39;ll cut this endless review short. Bottom line: the game is awesome and purchasing the extra content is definitely worth it. However even more content would be pristine. Great job dev(s)!</p>

With the addition of boats this opens the door for awesome possibilities to come to the future but first I want to address an idea I came up with that would be cool for all aspects of the game. I know this idea I’m about to say will take a lot of time to make but I think would be overall really interesting and that is a learning system for the Ai. So for example a civilization is just created and at first they are really primitive and stupid but the more the people do the more the Ai learns so like say that civilization wants to attack another but a tactic isn’t working and they keep getting killed the Ai would think of an different plan of attack and maybe try a different angle, send more fighters, etc and the same idea can be implemented for a defensive stand point or really anything. After a lot of in game  years have passed that one civilization will be very smart and wise and a hard opponent to defeat. I came up with this idea when one civilization kept attacking the other but the defending civilization would destroy the Attacking then right after they did that they would swim across the channel and do the same tactic as their enemy and they kept doing that back and forth for so long and without my intervention it would’ve stayed like that. Just a thought for the future I’m sure you have your hands full but something to think about!","title":"A cool idea","userName":"Master chief 118"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6585703413","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-29T08:31:46Z","developerResponse":{"id":19369010,"body":"Hello!\nThanks for your ideas!

It has awesome features that no other game in the genre has. However, if it's possible, I'd love to see more things added to this game. Mainly just more powers/creatures/ect. I'd also love to see the whole colony system expanded on. Maybe add more features to that aspect specifically. Maybe some Heroes live in the colonies who go out and adventure or something. Animals should be able to breed so that you don't have a limited supply and have to spawn more of them. Also, it'd be cool to see some kind of automated spawner for hostile mobs. And maybe those hostile mobs also make little civilizations of their own, just to add another enemy for the races to fight. Imagine being able to spawn dragon eggs that start out as baby dragons who simply hunt for food, giving time for the humans to build up their defenses against the inevitable dragon attack as they grow and breed. It'd be cool if the humans could tame passive mobs like horses or dogs. Or for that matter, if they could tame dragons and fly around with them. Maybe nerf some of the hostile mobs so that spawning more than a few doesn't devestate an entire colony. \n\nAnyway, I understand the difficulty in making things like these so I'll cut this endless review short. Bottom line: the game is awesome and purchasing the extra content is definitely worth it. However even more content would be pristine.

It’s so entertaining to create worlds and destroy them, as well as giving life to many creatures. A key feature that would get me to give that last star would be boats. That would make this perfect. A few ideas to make the game even more enjoyable would be to add more races. For example, merfolk would set up buildings in oceans, can swim faster and attack in water, and can only last for a limited amount of time on land. The current races are great, but after a while they get boring. I think having more races with different attributes would make the game more interesting and give it a better replay value. Another thing that would be cool to add are more disasters. One example is a hurricane which could be a buffed up version of the tornado. It would be able to throw buildings rather than just destroy them for even more destruction. The last idea I have for a feature is more controlled monsters. One monster can be a controllable dragon or some other flying monster. Another could be a leviathan that swims in the water and jumps out to cause destruction. Those are just my takes though. Otherwise it’s an awesome game with tons to do! The very last thing I’d like to say is......   please add dogs. They could be tame able by humans and would have stats and a name when named. (I am aware that the devs and other people have come up with these ideas. I just wanted to show my examples and ideas of these potential features)","title":"Amazing game!

I think it would be a perfect game to put on Steam, virtually everyone has a pc capable of running this. There are a few things though. For a free game this is awesome, and don’t do this for Mobile because it might not be able to handle it. Try to add more room for the player to build empires, Civilizations, and allow the humans to use explosives on there own in a war for the bigger worlds. Give people the ability to chose the size of there world, and if they’re wanna cut explosives off from being used by Humans give them that choose. Also, allow them to chose there pre generated world, or to not chose one, and to have a blank map. Also on pc add ray tracing support if possible (would be cool, but don’t have to), and allow the player to chose there frame rate, graphics level, and resolution. Also, allow people to use save slots to save there worlds. Last I would like it if you put the game on consoles so I could play on my big living room tv. If you did all this I’d pay $10 for the game. As long as it included the pack your selling for $8. If you add any contact after that, like skins, extra abilities I’d pay for that via micro transactions. If the game gets big enough a multiplayer would be cool. So far I love the game, but you should add these things. 8/10 game currently. This would put it at a 9/10.

Please add the magic and buildings related to specific race into the game along with classes, and traits that benefits them depending on race. To lessen the magic impact, you could add natural ability to create mana from the body which increases over time or a structure that creates it over time. Also make constructing more strategic I want to see more advanced house rather a house that didn’t get upgrade because of lack of space or farming area, I would be very happy if you choose to add all of it or some of it if you deem it too overpowered.

The aspect of watching a short ad to gain a power for some time is a good idea but it’s too random and maybe you could pick 3 things you want and it would increase your chance of getting them. Maybe there could be a “undo” button Incase you do something by accident. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve clicked to place a bit of land with the big fat brush. These are all understandable things and you may not want to change them, however not adding dogs is a SIN. Pls add doggos. , and a noSpeaking of stats, there should be differences from human to human, wolf to wolf etc. also, why are all piranhas immortal? I’m genuinely confused. It’d be cool if there were normal fish and dolphins and stuff (more sea life)\nAlso, there could be spell-casting as a trait that could only develop when the creature was a certain level, and wouldn’t always develop (maybe 1 in 10 for orcs, 2 in 10 for humans and 4 in 10 for elves). This could mean explosions, damage rays etc. if a humanoid didn’t have spell casting they could shoot a bow. 5 out of 5, MASSIVE potential.

The construction is done well, with various ways to shape it with 4 varieties, a circle, square, diamond, and a weird jumble mix.  The destruction in this game is great.  Blowing people, animals, and just the world up feels great.  The screen vibrates making it feel nice and powerful, you can also bandits which throw tnt and destroy the world for you.  The RPG part of the game is fun, it can be worked on on the future.  I like that when they grow barley or wheat, or whatever it may be, you can put rain on it to grow it faster.  I also love how you can give them stone to make there wooden huts into stone houses.  I don’t really see them use metals that much, unless you zoom in on them and they have like a metal sword.  I would say my only problem with the game is that it cost 8$ for a full release build, the game is not that like phenomenal to cost that much, I would understand if it had more content, I recommend that they change the price to at least 3$ or 4$ and it would be fine.  I also think they should let you use some more of the items in the game before you buy, like let you have elfs and zombies.  Also they should give you lava in the beginning without having to buy.  I say this game is worth while if you have a child through 8-10 so they can just absolutely go ham on the innocent people of WorldBox.","title":"Good game, but limited","userName":"Meaty Reviews"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6392447215","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-03T23:54:41Z","developerResponse":{"id":18240133,"body":"Thanks for feedback!

You can do anything you want! Make worlds, spawn different types of people to make kingdoms, destroy the world in a multitude of different and fun ways, blow up places, and so much more! However I want to do one thing so badly: kill everyone with The plague. Now I know people that take randomly generated worlds and destroy them with the plague will be like: What do you mean?! I have no trouble getting the world infected with the plague you moron! I wish I could delete your vote! But, it’s really hard to get people to have the plague naturally spread across big oceans. You have to somehow pick them up or send them somehow to the place and you have to make sure they have the plague AND you have to make sure they don’t die AND you have to make sure that they infect someone AND you have to make sure they don’t go back to their home across the whole world. If one of those things I just listed goes wrong all of a sudden YOU FAILED. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\nOO!

More Civilizations I honestly don’t like only having 4 races because there are a lot more races I will really like the goblins are perfect enemy for the elves and the beastman can be like a neutral civilization I also will like the size of the maps to be bigger because I try to make continent’s but I can only make 1 because the map is small it will also be helpful to add some more animals like horses and foxes badgers any passive or neutral And that’s all I do have millions of other ideas but those are my main ideas I wanted to get out that’s all other than that great game edit 1              ok I have another suggestion how about we can take control of a unit or be able to be born in the world as a human orc dwarf or elf and we’re able to chop down trees make houses weapons\\armor fight expand put out fires attack and mine usual stuff the civilizations do because we always look at them from above but we’re not actually with them I know we have crabzilla but I will really like this
