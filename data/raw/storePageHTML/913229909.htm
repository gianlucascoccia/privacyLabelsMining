      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The Mobile Rewards (for Apple phones at least) seems to only support AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Sprint! Really stupid. I have a brand new iphone SE, the 2nd gen/2020 (and i still have a 5C, 5S’s, and 1st gen SE’s), but i use Straight Talk/TFW. I previously had Sprint, so now it makes sense why the Mobile Rewards stopped working for me a few years ago. 😒🙄 The ‘major’ carriers are too expensive, and don’t work any better than the cheaper stuff (i live in a rural area). I’m part of a few other research panels, and none of those care about Who provides your phone service, only about your Device/Data Usage!!<br />I have a ~10 year old laptop for the Nielsen ‘Computer’ rewards and that’s fine.. Just doesnt make sense to me. —— Oh, and i Joined this crap in 2016. All you get for a ‘connected computer’ is Sweepstakes entries. I still have old emails where i contacted “Customer Support” and it Sucked back then too! (My issue was NEVER Resolved. My rewards most likely stopped working when i switched carriers, and that was never asked..) Seems the ‘Support’ hasnt improved much after reading the recent reviews.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love how I can earn rewards just by having it on my device. I especially love that I don’t have to read a bunch of emails or sign up for anything or purchase anything in order to earn. I just wish I could earn the rewards faster. I would also like to add I’ve been a member since October 2014 I have the app and use it on my iPad when I first installed it I noticed it did seem to slow my device down. Then I found that my device wasn’t slowing down because I was running this app in the background it was running slow because of all the other apps I had been using were still running in the background not to mention all the web history and data from my web browsing just like on a computer every once in a while you have to clear out the cache and remove the junk files. So for those who claim this app caused their device to slow down try shutting down apps running in the background. Clearing out your web browser history, try deleting some of the past text messages you have stored on your device because it’s easier</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>There really should be a caution about not downloading this app unless you are with the specific carriers this app works with. I have Xfinity and since it uses Verizon I chose Verizon and had a nightmare of a time after losing my cellular data connection to Xfinity. Xfinity had no idea what was going on and it was only after I did a Google search that I found out how to restore my phone with Xfinity. If you have experienced the same thing go into Settings&gt;General&gt;Profiles and remove Nielsen. I have nothing against the app as I was never able to utilize it. As I stated I just wish there was a warning sign.</p>

Really stupid. I have a brand new iphone SE, the 2nd gen/2020 (and i still have a 5C, 5S’s, and 1st gen SE’s), but i use Straight Talk/TFW. I previously had Sprint, so now it makes sense why the Mobile Rewards stopped working for me a few years ago. 😒🙄 The ‘major’ carriers are too expensive, and don’t work any better than the cheaper stuff (i live in a rural area). I’m part of a few other research panels, and none of those care about Who provides your phone service, only about your Device/Data Usage!!\nI have a ~10 year old laptop for the Nielsen ‘Computer’ rewards and that’s fine.. Just doesnt make sense to me. —— Oh, and i Joined this crap in 2016. All you get for a ‘connected computer’ is Sweepstakes entries. I still have old emails where i contacted “Customer Support” and it Sucked back then too! (My issue was NEVER Resolved. My rewards most likely stopped working when i switched carriers, and that was never asked..)

I would also like to add I’ve been a member since October 2014 I have the app and use it on my iPad when I first installed it I noticed it did seem to slow my device down. Then I found that my device wasn’t slowing down because I was running this app in the background it was running slow because of all the other apps I had been using were still running in the background not to mention all the web history and data from my web browsing just like on a computer every once in a while you have to clear out the cache and remove the junk files. So for those who claim this app caused their device to slow down try shutting down apps running in the background.
