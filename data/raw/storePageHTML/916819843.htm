Sharped up my drawing skills in some of my week areas...which helped me out a lot and I was very impressed and thankful for. Learned great self drawn character building with different apps...one basic character drawing class based on basic shapes-CIRCLE*SQUARE*TRIANGLE and thee emotions each shape holds.  Made building characters 100% easier knowing if your character was going to be bad, powerful, happy, or even confused ...the shapes invented the character.  Even looking at cartoons or comic book characters the shapes speak for the bad guys right away.. I also learned VISUAL JOURNALING...which is a whole new world for me, new watercolour techniques, taking better photos with my phone, Chinese etegami painting, street drawing (building), interior design on vintage finds, Linocut Workshop, etc...etc... My list goes on and on.   I do recommend this to everyone.  They have something for all.   I am having a lot of fun with it and how seriously involved I got.  I look forward to my SKILLSHARE class daily.  I. JUST LOVE IT AND SO WILL YOU.  ENJOY AND HAVE FUN...BE SAFE...PEACE</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve tried various apps for learning, none of them have been satisfying so it was with reservation that I tried Skillshare. I was more than pleasantly surprised. The lesson get straight to the subject, the instructors explain everything with clarity and don’t waste any time on unnecessary babbling. For all that you can learn on Skillshare, I find the price to be great. I can actually afford it and for everything that you can learn, I can only say that it’s Amazing! Some of the classes are surprisingly interesting. I have found classes, for example, on designs that I’ve never even thought about. On Skillshare you can discover all kinds of classes that are completely new to you, or new aspects that you can add to skills and knowledge that you already have. If you like to learn new things, I highly recommend Skillshare.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I like the idea of Skillshare-the class content is great and constantly evolving, the amount of videos and topics is almost overwhelming lol..the app could use some work. I have tons of saved classes and no way to sort through them. Also, I would REALLY like a functional Roku TV app. I hate streaming from my phone and watching it on there-I have incredibly bad vision and watching things on my phone screen (which is an iPhone plus, so not the smallest screen) puts a lot of strain on my eyes. I was able to find a free screen mirroring service to stream to my Roku but it wasn’t the easiest to use and was loaded with ads. My free trial will be up in the beginning of April and I would really like to sign up for an annual subscription but I just can’t justify the cost for something I can’t stream directly to my tv, limiting my ability to really use the service. As of now I have probably 50 classes saved to my list and have only been able to watch maybe 5 of them since I signed up in January, because as I said, the strain on my eyes is too much. Please add a Roku TV app or the ability to mirror directly from the Skillshare app to any tv!</p>

The Skillshare website and service including (without limitation) www.skillshare.com (the “Site”) and other all websites, mobile applications and other interactive properties through which the service is delivered (collectively, the “Services”) are owned, operated and distributed by Skillshare, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Skillshare” or “we” and through similar words such as “us,” “our,” etc.). By accessing any part of the Services, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions described below (this “Privacy Policy”) and the terms and conditions of our terms of service (the “Terms of Service”). If you do not agree to any of these terms, you should not use the Services. This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both users who are simply viewing content available via the Services and users who have registered as members of Skillshare.\n\nWe may, at our sole discretion, modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make material changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email. By accessing the Services at any time after such modifications, you are agreeing to be bound by the updated policy. This Privacy Policy was last modified as of May 23, 2018.\n\nGeneral\nYour privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of Personal Data (as defined below). The following outlines our privacy policy.\n\nEU Personal Data\nIf you are located in the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined in the EU Privacy Notice below.\n\nPersonal Data\nWhen your register with us and become a Skillshare Member, when you choose to teach or attend a class, we will ask you for Personal Data. “Personal Data” refers to information about you that can be used to contact or individually identify you. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information. Transactions on Skillshare involving your billing and payment information are processed by PayPal and Stripe and are subject to their privacy policies. We do not store any of the credit card or banking information that you provide to these payment processors.\n\nIn order to send you email from Skillshare, we need your email address. To provide you with additional services, we may also request your name, general location, and telephone number. We may give some or all of this information to the teachers for classes that you sign up for so that they can coordinate their classes. We will not give your name, email, or other Personal Data to unaffiliated third parties except with your consent or as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy. Though we employ industry standard measures to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose Personal Data when required by law or when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process that we receive or to protect our interests or the safety of others. In addition, we may provide Personal Data to employees, consultants or other business or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. In such circumstances, we require that these parties agree to protect the confidentiality of such information and to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We may use your Personal Data to operate, improve, understand and personalize our Services.\n\nVoluntary Disclosure\nAny Personal Data or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other users for any reason. Your profile pages (“Profile”) and any online classrooms you participate in are typically publicly available. You have the ability to change your account settings to limit access to your profile, and may delete content you post to public classrooms. You should exercise caution before disclosing your Personal Data via these or any other public venues.\n\nFor example, if you choose to sign up for a Skillshare account, you may have a Profile on the site, containing your full name and some basic information including your location and bio. You may also add additional optional information to your Profile. You may control what type of Profile information is shown to others through your Account Settings. Any information you choose to provide as part of your Profile should reflect how much you want other Skillshare users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise your profile information at any time.\n\nChildren’s Privacy\nAs noted in our Terms of Service, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Data about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at help@skillshare.com.\n\nInformation About Cookies\nWe use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Services, and to analyze traffic patterns on the Services. The Services also use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and JavaScript (collectively, “Cookies”) to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and use our Site and Services, to analyze trends, learn about our user base and operate and improve our Services. For example, we use Cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit, and to track whether emails we send you have been viewed. Cookies are small files – usually consisting of letters and numbers – placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device when you use that device to visit our Site. We sometimes combine information collected through Cookies that is not Personal Data with Personal Data that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are or whether you have an account with us. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties.\n\nCookies can either be “session Cookies” or “persistent Cookies”. Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that are stored on your device while you are visiting our Site or using our Services, whereas “persistent Cookies” are stored on your device for a period of time after you leave our Site or Services. The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your device varies from Cookie to Cookie. We use persistent Cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our Services, how often you return, how your use of the Services may vary over time. We also use persistent Cookies to measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts. Through these Cookies, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” or “DNT” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites, and web applications, and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Because we collect browsing and persistent identifier data, the Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our properties.\n\nSome Cookies are placed by a third party on your device and may provide information to us and third parties about your browsing habits (such as your visits to our Site or Services, the pages you have visited and the links and advertisements you have clicked). These Cookies can be used to determine whether certain third party services are being used, to identify your interests, to retarget advertisements to you and to serve advertisements to you that we or others believe are relevant to you. We do not control third party Cookies.\n\nWe use the following types of Cookies:\n\nEssential Cookies. Essential Cookies are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Site or Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.\nFunctionality Cookies. Functional Cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services. These Cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).\nPerformance/Analytical Cookies. Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Site and Services such as by collecting information about the daily number of visitors to the Services, the daily requests we receive for particular files on the Services, and what geographical areas those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others. Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Services’ content for those who engage with our advertising. For example, Google, Inc. (“Google”) uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics services. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You have the option to opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.\nRetargeting/Advertising Cookies. Retargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you. For more information about this, please see the section below titled “Third Party Advertising”.\nYou can decide whether or not to accept Cookies. One way you can do this is through your internet browser’s settings. Most browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allow you to decide on acceptance of each new Cookie in a variety of ways. You can also delete all Cookies that are already on your computer. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some Services and functionalities may not work.\n\nTo explore what Cookie setting are available to you, look in the “preferences” or “options” section of your browser’s menu. To find our more information about Cookies, including information about how to manage and delete Cookies, please visit https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/ or http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.\n\nThird Party Advertising\nWe may serve advertisements, and also allow third party ad networks, including third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services. These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors (“Interest-Based Ads”). Information for Internet-Based Ads (including Personal Data) may be provided to us by you, or derived from the usage patterns of particular users on the Services and/or services of Third Parties (but will not include your name, address, email address or telephone number). Such information may be gathered through tracking users’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties. To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Web beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.\n\nThrough the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites. To make choices about Interest-Based Ads from participating third parties, including to opt out of receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from participating organizations, please visit the DAA’s or NAI’s consumer opt out pages, which are located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ or http://www.aboutads.info/choices. Users in the European Union should visit the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s user information website http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.\n\nWe do not share your Personal Data with advertisers without your consent. However, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a Cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected.\n\nOther Sites\nThe Services may contain links to other websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites or services, and you should review the privacy policy of each such website or service to make sure that you are comfortable with it before providing any Personal Data. For example, all teacher payments for classes are processed through third party payment processors. As discussed above, we do not receive any of the credit card information you provide to our third party payment processors, and all such information is subject to their privacy policies.\n\nTeachers\nAs discussed above, we may give your Personal Data to the teachers for classes (“Teachers”) that you sign up for so that they can coordinate their classes. As part of our Terms of Use, Skillshare Teachers agree not to abuse other users' Personal Data. Abuse is defined as using Personal Data for any purpose other than those explicitly specified in the Teachers' Class. However, please understand that Skillshare Teachers are not our employees or consultants and that we are not party to any transaction between you and the Teacher. As a result, we cannot control their actions and cannot be held liable for any actions that they may take.\n\nBusiness Transfers\nIn the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from users, including without limitation Personal Data, as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your Personal Data is treated, transferred, or used.\n\nTransfers to the United States\nThe Services are hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Services from the European Union, please see the section titled “Transfers of Personal Data” in the EU Privacy Notice below. If you are accessing the Services from any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Services, which is governed by United States law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service, you are transferring your Personal Data to the United States and you consent to that transfer.\n\nCalifornia Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of the Services who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email with 'California Privacy Rights' in the heading to help@skillshare.com or write us at the address listed below.\n\nEU Privacy Notice\nIf you are located in the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.\n\nFor this EU Privacy Notice section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but, in addition to the information identified in the Privacy Policy as Personal Data above, “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. Skillshare will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.\n\nIf there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at help@skillshare.com.\n\nWhat Personal Data Do We Collect From You?

You hereby consent to the transfer of your data to the U.S. as set forth herein.\n\nSkillshare is committed to the Principles of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection and use of Personal Data transferred from the EU.

The Privacy Shield Principles require that we remain potentially liable if any third party processing Personal Data on our behalf fails to comply with these Privacy Shield Principles (except to the extent we are not responsible for the event giving rise to any alleged damage). Skillshare’s compliance with the Privacy Shield is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

The Skillshare website and service including (without limitation) www.skillshare.com (the “Site”) and other all websites, mobile applications and other interactive properties through which the service is delivered (collectively, the “Services”) are owned, operated and distributed by Skillshare, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Skillshare” or “we” and through similar words such as “us,” “our,” etc.). By accessing any part of the Services, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions described below (this “Privacy Policy”) and the terms and conditions of our terms of service (the “Terms of Service”). If you do not agree to any of these terms, you should not use the Services. This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both users who are simply viewing content available via the Services and users who have registered as members of Skillshare.\n\nWe may, at our sole discretion, modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make material changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email. By accessing the Services at any time after such modifications, you are agreeing to be bound by the updated policy. This Privacy Policy was last modified as of May 23, 2018.\n\nGeneral\nYour privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of Personal Data (as defined below). The following outlines our privacy policy.\n\nEU Personal Data\nIf you are located in the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined in the EU Privacy Notice below.\n\nPersonal Data\nWhen your register with us and become a Skillshare Member, when you choose to teach or attend a class, we will ask you for Personal Data. “Personal Data” refers to information about you that can be used to contact or individually identify you. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information. Transactions on Skillshare involving your billing and payment information are processed by PayPal and Stripe and are subject to their privacy policies. We do not store any of the credit card or banking information that you provide to these payment processors.\n\nIn order to send you email from Skillshare, we need your email address. To provide you with additional services, we may also request your name, general location, and telephone number. We may give some or all of this information to the teachers for classes that you sign up for so that they can coordinate their classes. We will not give your name, email, or other Personal Data to unaffiliated third parties except with your consent or as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy. Though we employ industry standard measures to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose Personal Data when required by law or when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process that we receive or to protect our interests or the safety of others. In addition, we may provide Personal Data to employees, consultants or other business or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. In such circumstances, we require that these parties agree to protect the confidentiality of such information and to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We may use your Personal Data to operate, improve, understand and personalize our Services.\n\nVoluntary Disclosure\nAny Personal Data or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other users for any reason. Your profile pages (“Profile”) and any online classrooms you participate in are typically publicly available. You have the ability to change your account settings to limit access to your profile, and may delete content you post to public classrooms. You should exercise caution before disclosing your Personal Data via these or any other public venues.\n\nFor example, if you choose to sign up for a Skillshare account, you may have a Profile on the site, containing your full name and some basic information including your location and bio. You may also add additional optional information to your Profile. You may control what type of Profile information is shown to others through your Account Settings. Any information you choose to provide as part of your Profile should reflect how much you want other Skillshare users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise your profile information at any time.\n\nChildren’s Privacy\nAs noted in our Terms of Service, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Data about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at help@skillshare.com.\n\nInformation About Cookies\nWe use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Services, and to analyze traffic patterns on the Services. The Services also use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and JavaScript (collectively, “Cookies”) to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and use our Site and Services, to analyze trends, learn about our user base and operate and improve our Services. For example, we use Cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit, and to track whether emails we send you have been viewed. Cookies are small files – usually consisting of letters and numbers – placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device when you use that device to visit our Site. We sometimes combine information collected through Cookies that is not Personal Data with Personal Data that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are or whether you have an account with us. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties.\n\nCookies can either be “session Cookies” or “persistent Cookies”. Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that are stored on your device while you are visiting our Site or using our Services, whereas “persistent Cookies” are stored on your device for a period of time after you leave our Site or Services. The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your device varies from Cookie to Cookie. We use persistent Cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our Services, how often you return, how your use of the Services may vary over time. We also use persistent Cookies to measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts. Through these Cookies, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” or “DNT” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites, and web applications, and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Because we collect browsing and persistent identifier data, the Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our properties.\n\nSome Cookies are placed by a third party on your device and may provide information to us and third parties about your browsing habits (such as your visits to our Site or Services, the pages you have visited and the links and advertisements you have clicked). These Cookies can be used to determine whether certain third party services are being used, to identify your interests, to retarget advertisements to you and to serve advertisements to you that we or others believe are relevant to you. We do not control third party Cookies.\n\nWe use the following types of Cookies:\n\nEssential Cookies. Essential Cookies are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Site or Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.\nFunctionality Cookies. Functional Cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services. These Cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).\nPerformance/Analytical Cookies. Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Site and Services such as by collecting information about the daily number of visitors to the Services, the daily requests we receive for particular files on the Services, and what geographical areas those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others. Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Services’ content for those who engage with our advertising. For example, Google, Inc. (“Google”) uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics services. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You have the option to opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.\nRetargeting/Advertising Cookies. Retargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you. For more information about this, please see the section below titled “Third Party Advertising”.\nYou can decide whether or not to accept Cookies. One way you can do this is through your internet browser’s settings. Most browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allow you to decide on acceptance of each new Cookie in a variety of ways. You can also delete all Cookies that are already on your computer. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some Services and functionalities may not work.\n\nTo explore what Cookie setting are available to you, look in the “preferences” or “options” section of your browser’s menu. To find our more information about Cookies, including information about how to manage and delete Cookies, please visit https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/ or http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.\n\nThird Party Advertising\nWe may serve advertisements, and also allow third party ad networks, including third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services. These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors (“Interest-Based Ads”). Information for Internet-Based Ads (including Personal Data) may be provided to us by you, or derived from the usage patterns of particular users on the Services and/or services of Third Parties (but will not include your name, address, email address or telephone number). Such information may be gathered through tracking users’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties. To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Web beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.\n\nThrough the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different websites. To make choices about Interest-Based Ads from participating third parties, including to opt out of receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from participating organizations, please visit the DAA’s or NAI’s consumer opt out pages, which are located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ or http://www.aboutads.info/choices. Users in the European Union should visit the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s user information website http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.\n\nWe do not share your Personal Data with advertisers without your consent. However, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a Cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected.\n\nOther Sites\nThe Services may contain links to other websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites or services, and you should review the privacy policy of each such website or service to make sure that you are comfortable with it before providing any Personal Data. For example, all teacher payments for classes are processed through third party payment processors. As discussed above, we do not receive any of the credit card information you provide to our third party payment processors, and all such information is subject to their privacy policies.\n\nTeachers\nAs discussed above, we may give your Personal Data to the teachers for classes (“Teachers”) that you sign up for so that they can coordinate their classes. As part of our Terms of Use, Skillshare Teachers agree not to abuse other users' Personal Data. Abuse is defined as using Personal Data for any purpose other than those explicitly specified in the Teachers' Class. However, please understand that Skillshare Teachers are not our employees or consultants and that we are not party to any transaction between you and the Teacher. As a result, we cannot control their actions and cannot be held liable for any actions that they may take.\n\nBusiness Transfers\nIn the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from users, including without limitation Personal Data, as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your Personal Data is treated, transferred, or used.\n\nTransfers to the United States\nThe Services are hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Services from the European Union, please see the section titled “Transfers of Personal Data” in the EU Privacy Notice below. If you are accessing the Services from any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Services, which is governed by United States law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service, you are transferring your Personal Data to the United States and you consent to that transfer.\n\nCalifornia Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of the Services who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email with 'California Privacy Rights' in the heading to help@skillshare.com or write us at the address listed below.\n\nEU Privacy Notice\nIf you are located in the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.\n\nFor this EU Privacy Notice section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but, in addition to the information identified in the Privacy Policy as Personal Data above, “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. Skillshare will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.\n\nIf there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at help@skillshare.com.\n\nWhat Personal Data Do We Collect From You?

Sharped up my drawing skills in some of my week areas...which helped me out a lot and I was very impressed and thankful for. Learned great self drawn character building with different apps...one basic character drawing class based on basic shapes-CIRCLE*SQUARE*TRIANGLE and thee emotions each shape holds.  Made building characters 100% easier knowing if your character was going to be bad, powerful, happy, or even confused ...the shapes invented the character.  Even looking at cartoons or comic book characters the shapes speak for the bad guys right away.. I also learned VISUAL JOURNALING...which is a whole new world for me, new watercolour techniques, taking better photos with my phone, Chinese etegami painting, street drawing (building), interior design on vintage finds, Linocut Workshop, etc...etc... My list goes on and on.   I do recommend this to everyone.  They have something for all.   I am having a lot of fun with it and how seriously involved I got.

Some of the classes are surprisingly interesting. I have found classes, for example, on designs that I’ve never even thought about.

I was able to find a free screen mirroring service to stream to my Roku but it wasn’t the easiest to use and was loaded with ads. My free trial will be up in the beginning of April and I would really like to sign up for an annual subscription but I just can’t justify the cost for something I can’t stream directly to my tv, limiting my ability to really use the service. As of now I have probably 50 classes saved to my list and have only been able to watch maybe 5 of them since I signed up in January, because as I said, the strain on my eyes is too much.

They gave me a generic response on how to nevigate by category, obviously they didn’t read the content of my email. \nI was seeking to learn some more advanced animation techniques, digital painting techniques but only found beginner classes that cover the same basic content. \nIn addition, most of the “instructors” are not teachers or professionals working at a high level. I watched a digital painting class where the instructor taught how to TRACE  an imported photo. It was a class suited to kindergarten craft so you can bring home something that looks good but takes NO skill to make. No one is impressed and nothing learned. If you are looking to make fun art or learn a little trick or two to look like you can do something then this maybe for you.

This is particularly painful for me because I have satellite Internet on my computer where is on my phone I have unlimited data. Perhaps I have the opposite problem of most people but I live in the wilds of Maine and there is no broadband. Otherwise the app is very convenient and I quite enjoy just watching the classes but I’m waiting in the car somewhere and can’t even do the projects.

They proceeded to tell me that I could not get a refund because they can’t see any cancellation attempts??? You can’t see that I cancelled my account, so I am getting charged? When I laid the situation out to the employee, they were completely useless. They told me they can’t help me at all and there’s no way I can get a refund for the service that I NEVER USED and CANCELLED. Why call it customer service at all? More like frustrating email clutter that does not serve any purpose, because they have no power to help you. I’m outraged and would strongly advice you not subscribe or start a “free” trial.

I can’t edit my lists in the app there isn’t a very clean way within the app to organize the classes I want to watch which seems a shame with something with so much content and more coming everyday there’s not a good way to really sift through it all.\n\nThe app almost seems like it’s designed to be a one off kind of thing like use the free trial and be done there’s no incentive to keep it long term because it doesn’t make it easily accessible long term. If I want to watch 15-20 different classes there’s no way to find the one I want besides sifting through my watch later list. It’s sad that the website is the only way to manage your content like what’s the point of even having the app if it’s just completely inferior to the website in every way. \n\nI want to be able to cast to my tv and organize my classes it really doesn’t seem like a whole lot to ask if I’m paying a premium price for content in 2019 it’s not like the service is free.
