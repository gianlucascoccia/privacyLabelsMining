Absolutely love it!” -- @brennandunn\n\n“I never, ever, ever thought I’d see this, and yet here it is: CREDIT CARD BEAST DEFEATED! Props to @YNAB which helped me get it done!” -- @taber\n\n“3 years ago I started with YNAB, the goal was paying off all my debt. With YNAB, I was able to double the goal!

Thank you!” -- @Thai_Jonny\n\nYou’ve Never Budgeted Like This Before \nYNAB is unlike any personal finance app, expense tracker, or money management system you’ve tried before—because it works. The powerful combination of award-winning apps and a proven method—YNAB’s Four Rules—has changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people by teaching them to get control of their finances, stop stressing, and live the life they want to live. \n\nA Proven Method—YNAB’s Four Rules \nRule One: Give Every Dollar A Job | Be intentional about what you want your money to do before you spend it. \n\nRule Two: Embrace Your True Expenses | Break up larger, less frequent expenses into smaller, manageable amounts. By saving monthly for insurance premiums, holidays, or car repairs, when the time comes, your money is ready and waiting to do its job.\n\nRule Three: Roll With The Punches | When life changes, so must your budget.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>What’s New in v2.15.1<br />Today’s release includes some infrastructure improvements that fall under the category of “nothing to see here.” But also some bug-fixes that fall under “you might have seen these”. With that, a few details:<br /><br />• We fixed an issue that could crash the app when assistive technologies like VoiceOver or Voice Control were enabled.<br />• We also fixed an issue where the keyboard could cover text fields during sign-in (which, as you can imagine, was not at all helpful).<br />• And we fixed a bug where going back to a device or budget that hadn’t been synced in a while could cause scheduled transactions to enter the budget when they shouldn’t.<br />• Speaking of scheduled transactions, “Enter Now” wasn’t working correctly 100% of the time with scheduled transfers—but now it does.<br />• Also, we cleaned up some issues with the animations that happen when approving transactions.<br />• Finally, the new iOS 14 widgets are now longer cut off when Display Zoom is enabled.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The app/methodology/paradigm(s) have really revolutionized the way I approach my own finances and i cannot recommend it enough from that regard as a service &amp; function. I have budgeted myself for well over a decade and have done alright, but always felt there was some missing piece or rather a “hole” that seemed to be getting in my way. This app/way of tagging and budgeting really helped me see in a very adult way, the ways in which I was failing to connect some financial dots and keep myself from doing as well as I should have been; it made sense after I really pressed myself to drop my bad thinking that I had developed to try and work around the natural holes in a standard budget logic.<br /><br />Having said all of that, I find myself using my iPad Pro to access the web client, as the app itself is so kiddy and limited that it makes it actually harder to digest the information presented and make the most sense of it. So much information but it’s all so “big” that you can’t see the big picture, almost simply because the text and forms are so LARGE. Really the app could be and needs to be as feature-rich and dense as the web app; basically take the web app and adapt it to be touch targets and color coded like the app is. It could be so much BETTER than the web interface with all the screen real estate on the iPad and the easy entry and basic structure they have in place for it already. I really look forward to the iPad app “growing up.”</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve used YNAB since I was a broke college student, and it’s helped me keep my financial life on track despite barely breaking the poverty line for my first few years out of school. I have never struggled to make rent or pay for my necessities, and I’ve stayed free of consumer debt. Because of YNAB I have been able to carefully weigh any debt I did take on (training for a career switch, a car) and pay it down without any stress. I clung stubbornly to the desktop app until I convinced my partner to start using it, and saw how far the web/mobile app had come, at which point I promptly switched over. I have a thing about app subscriptions (hate ‘em), but the YNAB team is consistently rolling out improvements and features, all of which have been rock solid and helped me plan for my financial future even better. It’s one of the rare cases where I get enough value from the service that I’m not only willing but HAPPY to pay to help the company grow. I could not recommend this app more highly. If you’ve ever struggled to save money or pay down debt, if you regularly get clobbered by predictable but irregular payments (6 month insurance premiums, replacing your computer/phone/car), if you need more accountability to make sure you’re spending your money in line with your values, there is nothing better on the market for helping you get there.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is one of the best things I have ever done for myself. I have always lived paycheck to paycheck. It’s been very difficult for me to save, and when expenses would pop up, like car repairs, I would have high anxiety. I had tried making a budget for myself before, using various spreadsheets designed for budgeting, but most had me try to figure out what I would bring in in a year and what I would spend in that year. It was something I could never figure out very well or stick to. YNAB starts by only having you budget the money you have right now. Every dollar gets a job. It makes it so much more manageable. In just a short period of six months, I’ve gone from having debt, to a point where that debt is gone and I just reached 30 days of the age of my money, which gives me so much more choice and MUCH less anxiety.<br /><br />The other great thing that sets this app apart is the help you receive. There are tons of online training sessions daily, and any time I hit a snag where I wasn’t sure how to handle something, I could get a hold of someone almost immediately who would walk me through the issue I was having. <br /><br />I would highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to get control of their personal finances and live a bit more at ease day to day.</p>

New in v2.15.1\nToday’s release includes some infrastructure improvements that fall under the category of “nothing to see here.” But also some bug-fixes that fall under “you might have seen these”. With that, a few details:\n\n• We fixed an issue that could crash the app when assistive technologies like VoiceOver or Voice Control were enabled.\n• We also fixed an issue where the keyboard could cover text fields during sign-in (which, as you can imagine, was not at all helpful).\n• And we fixed a bug where going back to a device or budget that hadn’t been synced in a while could cause scheduled transactions to enter the budget when they shouldn’t.\n• Speaking of scheduled transactions, “Enter Now” wasn’t working correctly 100% of the time with scheduled transfers—but now it does.\n• Also, we cleaned up some issues with the animations that happen when approving transactions.\n• Finally, the new iOS 14 widgets are now longer cut off when Display Zoom is enabled.","releaseDate":"2021-02-22"},{"versionDisplay":"2.15","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.15\nWith the new year comes a new YNAB update! \n\nNew feature:\n• We’re releasing support for iOS 14 widgets!

Fewer loading screens = more time for the finer things in life, like reading these release notes.\n• Previously, you could only use Enter Now on one scheduled transaction at a time. No longer! Bulk enter to your heart’s content.\n\nBug fixes\n• We fixed an issue where, under some circumstances, you might see the category balance for the current month rather than the affected month when choosing the category for, and saving,  past transactions. No, we are not warping the space-time continuum (yet).\n• We fixed a bug on iOS 14 where tapping the “spent” amount on iPad would not show the category activity. You’ll see it now, never fear.\n• In the past, occasionally the Overspent Categories banner on iPad wouldn’t show the correct number of overspent categories. That was infuriating, and is now fixed.","releaseDate":"2020-11-23"},{"versionDisplay":"2.14","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.14\n\n• Improvements\nIn this release, we’ve revamped the help section!

Previously, we only showed an alert icon and messaging saying: \"Transaction Import Failed, Resolve errors to retry.\" We now break this error status down into more useful messages such as \"Delayed, This issue usually resolves itself\", \"Reauthorize, To continue importing transactions\", \"Blocked, Learn more\", and a few others.\n• We've now made it possible to leave the transaction editor by swiping down on its title bar in all cases.\n\nBug fixes\n• We fixed a couple of cosmetic issues when swiping left on transactions on iOS 12.","releaseDate":"2020-08-17"},{"versionDisplay":"2.13.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.13.1\n\nWe’ve pushed out a handful of bug-fixes just in time for Summer! Maybe “handful” isn’t the right measurement. Maybe it is. Either way, they’re big hands, because they also did some meaningful behind-the-scenes infrastructural work as well. I feel weird that we’re still talking about hands now. Anyway, here are just a few of the bug-fixes that we did for this release:\n\nBug Fixes\n• We’ve fixed a bug that sometimes sent users to the budget switcher when starting the app, even though a budget was open when they last left the app. That’s like when you accidentally pull out your bookmark from the book you’re reading, which is super frustrating...which is why I dog-ear my pages...I know...I’M A MONSTER!!!\n• We’ve fixed a bug where the app would sometimes crash while starting up. Safety first! No one likes crashing.\n• We’ve fixed a bug where uploading an image in the support chat could sometimes crash the app. Yeah...that sounds like the opposite of how awesome our Support team is. “Oh...you need help with your budget? [image uploading]...and...oh...looks like YNAB crashed, and thanks for reaching out.” Fortunately, this is all fixed.","releaseDate":"2020-07-06"},{"versionDisplay":"2.13","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.13\nYou’ve heard of #lifegoals and maybe even #squadgoals, but what about #goalgoals?! Well, in this latest release, YNAB has fulfilled everyone’s #goalgoals by taking goals in YNAB to the next level. When setting goals in YNAB you’ll now have quite a few more options to help you accomplish all of your #moneygoals.\n\nImprovements\n[extreme Andrés Cantor voice] GoooooooooOOOOOOOOaaaaaaAAAAAlllllllllLLLLs\n• We added new “goal type selection” for increased clarity on which type of goal to use and when.\n• You can now set a target day of the month for Monthly goals.\n• There is also now a Weekly goal option where you can target a day of the week.\n• Lastly, we’ve also extended the By Date goals to allow selecting an exact target date. You can also (optionally) repeat goals every n months/years. And “n” in this case stands for number...I think...or maybe just months that start with “n”...November? Napril? Hmmm....\n------------------\n• We've now made it possible to collapse all scheduled transactions so you can decide whether you want to see them in your accounts or not. I wish I could literally and existentially just collapse my scheduled auto insurance bills.\n• You thought we were done talking about goals, didn’t you. Nope! YNAB will now show more information about how budgeting a negative amount affects a Target Balance By Date goal.\n• We changed the behavior for configuring notifications to always be consistent. You can now always configure your notifications from the Settings menu.\n\nBug fixes\n• This was just a small tweak, but now all transactions align vertically perfectly in the Accounts tab...or at least they’re more perfect...perfecter?\n• We fixed a rare crash that happened when going into split screen multitasking on iPad while reordering accounts. Listen, you multitasking YNABers, we get it. You want to do everything at once and we salute you, but give us time to catch up to your prolificness!\n• If you enabled larger accessibility text sizes in your iOS Settings, the payee wouldn't show in the transaction editor, but we fixed this particular issue.","releaseDate":"2020-06-17"},{"versionDisplay":"2.12.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.12.1\nOnce again, our developers have put on their bug-fixing pants (and pantsuits) to go-a-bug-wranglin’. And you’re all like, “why do you need to wear specific pants to fix bugs?” Hey, maybe don’t worry about how the bug-fixing sausage is made or how we just freely mix all sorts of metaphors together all willy-nilly. Just check out these sweet, sweet results:\n\n- Bug fixes\n• In some cases, the Create Goal button in the category details wouldn’t show up due to specific layout constraints. If it wasn’t showing up for you, it should now after this release.\n\n• Nearby payees can now be manually removed again without having to forget their location...or without having to choose to “forget their location.” Who among us wants to remember going to the DMV?\n\n• We fixed a rare issue where you could sometimes end up in an empty budget state on your phone while changing your password on web at the same time. No, this wasn’t an experimental Rule 5 - Transport Your Budget To An Alternate Dimension bit of code we were testing out. That hasn’t been released yet.\n\n• Fixed an edge case that would allow a transfer payee to get a geo location. For online banks that was probably extra creepy (your bank is calling from inside your house???) but it’s been fixed now!\n\n• We fixed a bug where the username and password input fields would be hidden behind the keyboard after returning to the app during login. Probably the most boring game of hide and seek ever, but that shouldn’t happen anymore.\n\n• On the iPhone SE, we fixed an issue where the notes field in the transaction editor would be hidden by the keyboard. Man. That keyboard is cramping our style. What are you trying to hide, keyboard?!\n\n• Fixed a rare crash when using Quick Budget. Um...that wasn’t what we meant by “Quick Budget.”\n\n• As part of our continued effort to make the web/mobile experiences more cohesive, we updated the icon for \"Account Settings\" to match what we have on web. Where we used to have a little \"settings panel\" icon, we now have a little \"user\" icon.","releaseDate":"2020-04-16"},{"versionDisplay":"2.12","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.12\nYou've signed in with a password and you may have signed in with Google, but I don't think you've truly lived until you've signed in with Apple. And now, with this release, you can (sign in with Apple)! Just think of how convenient it will be to not have to remember your password every time you go into YNAB to give dollars jobs. The future has truly arrived...or, at least, this is a nice-to-have feature for all of you die hard Apple fans...are we calling you AppleHeads™? I am now. We've also pushed some nice bug-fixes for all of you hard core (I know what I did there) AppleHeads™:\n\nImprovements\n• When you go to delete a category with transactions, we will now show you a warning explaining the risks and offer to hide the categories instead. I believe it was either Sir Winston Churchill or maybe Spiderman’s uncle who said, \"with great power comes great responsibility\"...but also, it doesn't hurt to throw in a courtesy warning modal with that power too.\n\nBug fixes\n• Fixed an iPad crash in iOS 12 when tapping the \"More\" menu button while editing transactions...and you thought we meant MORE crashes. Nope! \n• Fixed a crash that happened after doing a Fresh Start. Hopefully now, though, only your money stress levels will crash after doing a Fresh Start to go out there and get it with your financial goals. You can do this!...especially now that the app isn't crashing.\n• Fixed an issue where the To Be Budgeted banner on iPad would sometimes show as green when the amount was 0.\n• Fixed an issue where the Overspent Categories banner sometimes displayed a count of 0. This was a bug and NOT a Minority Report-style \"Precog\" feature where we tell you that you have overspent categories before you have them. Whew.\n• Fixed the toolbar layout for approving or categorizing transactions.\n• Fixed an issue where the scroll indicator never reached the bottom of the table on the Budget, Accounts and Transaction screens\n\nUntil next time, AppleHeads™...","releaseDate":"2020-03-19"},{"versionDisplay":"2.11.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.11.1\nSo, it looks like all of our iOS developers woke up on January 1st and made a New Year's resolution to completely eradicate all bugs and possibly even the memory of bugs existing as a thing. I don't know if maybe they watched A Bug's Life or Antz or that Jerry Seinfeld movie with bees, and just said, \"who do these guys even think they are with their legs and wings, swimming in raindrops and ruining picnics?!!!\" But then, instead of taking out actual bugs, they just went ham on getting rid of a ton of bugs for this release. Whatever the case may be, we fixed a TON of bugs:\n\n• Fixed a rare issue where the app could get stuck loading on launch...just like how real bugs sometimes get stuck loading up on lunch.\n• On the iPad, we fixed some cases where the budget tab would show a different month after switching back to the app or resizing it. To be clear, a different \"month\" was showing up, not a different \"moth.\" Moths are terrifying the way they dive bomb your lantern when you're camping at night. Sorry, we’ll stop talking about real bugs now.\n• We made it so the actions on the transaction toolbar are now all accessible in all multitasking modes and orientations. BTW, Multitasking is new. Now it’s new and improved!\n• Fixed a bug where sometimes subcategories were not able to be reordered until after an app restart. Not ideal, but now that restart shouldn’t be necessary!\n• Replaced \"Add Transaction\" with \"Record Payment\" in context menus for debt categories. This wasn’t just a text swap. There is now an appropriate behavior that happens as well, such as the cursor going to the outflow field.\n• Fixed a bug where if you had a By Date goal and the target date had already passed, we weren't letting you save changes to a category! Whoops! Fixed now.\n• Changed the flow for covering overspending on iPad using the red pill. Now it goes straight to a filtered list of categories to cover the overspending with. Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with Keanu Reeves choosing to leave the Matrix to become a grown-up man fetus who gets flushed down a robot toilet...sounds maybe a little strange out-of-context...\n• Cleaned up icons, simplified color schemes and did some minor animation fixes. Nothing major here, but it will pave the way for possible improvements to colors, icons and animations in the future.\n• Fixed the top of the empty state text being cut off in the payee selection screen. Was the full state half empty, or was the empty state half full? Now, we’ll never know.\n• Fixed an issue where the nearby payee was not defaulted when creating a new transaction before the device location is loaded. But let’s be honest, it’s usually Amazon, Target or Costco #AmIRight?\n• Previously, when tapping and holding on a section header, the context menu came up for the first cell in the section, making it difficult to reorder groups. This prevented context menus from popping up on budget section headers and also on all cells while editing. But we fixed this.\n• Fixed a crash when unmatching transactions on iPad.\n• Fixed a rare crash when reordering category groups...and hey, no one likes crashes, except I remember that movie, “Crash” winning best picture or something. Also, that Dave Matthews song was OK. Other than that, though, crashes are universally not liked.","releaseDate":"2020-02-10"},{"versionDisplay":"2.11","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.11\n2020. We're here. THE FUTURE!!!! And we are so ready for 2020 with this release. In honor of basically all of us now being in Bladerunner (the Harrison Ford one...well, maybe the Ryan Gosling one...who knows?) this new version of YNAB supports screen rotation and split-view/slide-over multitasking on iPad. I know. We're pretty much just all cyborgs at this point. Talk about a futuristic feature: with multitasking, you can have YNAB open on one side of your iPad and have Amazon open on the other side, looking at all of your purchases trying to figure out what that $5.49 charge was...socks? A single light bulb?...that might explain why the future is so bright...\n\nImprovements\n• When a user creates a split transaction, but then only enters a single category, we used to just send over the category information into a flattened single transaction. With this release, we now preserve all data from that split transaction (amount and memo) and bring it over to the single parent transaction. Split it and forget it is what we like to say...nope...that's not a thing.\n\nBug fixes\n• We did a tweak to fix a bug where keypad button presses didn't always register if users moved their fingers slightly while tapping a button. Look, we're not saying you're a sloppy typer. We've all been over-excited to enter in a vacation savings goal or a transaction for a gift for a friend. Either way, you're covered now.\n• We fixed a few cases of horizontal scrolling and/or cutoff side margins on iPad popovers where the arrow is on the right or left.\n• We also fixed an issue where the bottom of the hidden categories list gets cut off. We said \"hidden,\" not cut in half!!!\n• Raise your hand if you hate unexpected crashes...oh, literally everyone hates this...we do too. So, we fixed an issue that was causing crashes when the app was attempting to present an action sheet on the transaction list popover. Whew. We're so glad that everyone raised their hands there. Crashes are the worst.","releaseDate":"2020-01-13"},{"versionDisplay":"2.10.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.10.1\n\nWhat’s that smell? Is it frankincense? Lutefisk? Nope! It’s a whole bunch of yuletide bug-fixes and improvements that we’ve dropped just in time for the Holidays:\n\n• We’ve improved our integration with password managers. In particular, we now use iCloud key sharing, if you want to share credentials between the web and mobile app. Oh, what fun it is to login to YNAB without having to remember your password in a one-horse open (but secure) sleigh.\n• We improved the transaction details area, so that it no longer does any annoying horizontal scrolling. Hark! The horizontal angel of scrolling will no longer sing! Also, we don’t use the word “hark” enough. Let’s make that a thing.\n• Hark!...actually more like, “dark!” We fixed the text color for matched transactions that looked a little blurry in Dark Mode. “Was that letter an L or an I?” Now, you’ll know that there was “No L, Noooo L, No L, Noooooo LL.” I’ll see myself out.\n• We fixed an issue that involved the timing for when we ask for biometric authentication again. What more can we do? Baby, all we want for Christmas is...proper biometric authentication timing.\n• Alright, so remember how the matched transaction text was blurry for Dark Mode and then we fixed it? Well, our flag images were also a little blurry as well. And we’ve now fixed those flag images to be nice and crisp...like a winter day...like a winter wonderland, even?\n• There was an issue when using voiceover for frequency selection in the Repeat field. But we fixed it, and now things can be said many times, many ways…\n• We made the transaction screen button animations smoother. And by that, I mean we made them so they actually animate now. Hallelujah!\n\nAnd, with that, I know you’re tired of our Holiday-themed release notes, so we’ll just end by wishing you a Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and a Happy New Year from all of us at YNAB!","releaseDate":"2019-12-11"},{"versionDisplay":"2.10","releaseNotes":"You know how the old saying goes: the darker the mode, the sweeter the budgeting. That's totally not a thing anyone has ever said, but perhaps it will be? With this release, we've gone dark. Yep. We added Dark Mode to your favorite budgeting app. Some of you might be wondering if it will still be as satisfying to move money and crush debt in the dark...we think it will be! Don't be afraid of the dark! Give YNAB's new Dark Mode a try! And when you're ready to turn the light back on, check out some of the other bug fixes and improvements that we've made in this release:\n\nWhat’s new\n• Dark Mode - I can't stress enough how deliciously dark YNAB is now. It's at least 100% darker than our normal mode.\n• iOS 13 Context Menus - We've taken advantage of this helpful, new iOS 13 feature. Now you can do literally dozens of contextually appropriate actions in the budget view, account view and transaction lists. These menus will save you time by doing all sorts of things like pre-populating the appropriate category when adding transaction or giving you the ability to add or edit goals in the contextually appropriate category.\n\nBug fixes\n• We fixed a budget reorder issue...well, actually it was two issues. When reordering the top budget group in a budget table, the other budget views would get pushed all the way down. Even worse than that, though, was if you only had two budget groups, the reordering would appear to work, but upon refreshing the table, it would revert back to the order it was in. We fixed these issues and order (or reorder) has been restored to the universe...er, your budget.\n• In iOS 13, there was a cursor issue when YNABers were going in to edit a budget category. You would have to delete the category name in order to get the cursor to move from the beginning of the text field. We went ahead and fixed that, so that should be an improvement upon a cursory reassessment of your budget categories...is that what 'cursory' means?\n• We recently added the search feature to our iOS app, and it's pretty great. But also, there was a small issue...when users were tapping the \"Cancel\" button to cancel their search, the \"Cancel\" button wasn't going away. It was overstaying its welcome. Well, \"Cancel\" button, I hate to tell you this, but after you've been tapped, that's really all that we need from you. You're great. We love what you do, but when you cancel something, you really just need to go away until we need you again. Oh, also, we didn't just tell the \"Cancel\" button to go away. We actually fixed the issue.\n• We were able to fix an issue where the bottom tab bar would disappear in some cases when YNABers were moving money or editing transactions. We've got to give a huge shout out to our new mobile developer, Itai, on a lot of these fixes. He came into a world where we've got buttons not disappearing when they should and tab bars disappearing when they shouldn't and he totally wrangled these disappearing/reappearing problem children and put them back in line. Thanks, Itai!","releaseDate":"2019-11-13"},{"versionDisplay":"2.9.3","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.9.3\n\nThis release contains fixes to some bugs related to our 3rd-party messaging platform. Did someone say \"party?\" Yes we did. Feel free to celebrate this release with us!","releaseDate":"2019-10-07"},{"versionDisplay":"2.9.2","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.9.2\n\nOh, don’t mind us...we’ve just been busy polishing and bug fixing split transactions and sync issues for this past release. Here are some of the changes we’ve made to keep your YNAB experience as smooth as possible:\n\nImprovements\n• We “KonMari’d” and decluttered the \"Edit\" mode for reordering accounts. For starters, the button now says \"Reorder\" instead of \"Edit,\" which is clearer. But we also now hide the Notification Permission section, transaction banners and the Manage section. We left only the UI pieces necessary that will bring you reordering joy. The other UI pieces for that mode have been taken to the local Goodwill.\n• In Account Settings, we added the ability to allow external \"Learn More\" style links to open in Mobile Safari.\n• If you create a split transaction with a single subtransaction on the web we'll now display that correctly...we’re not 100% sure why you would want to do that, but you may have some system you use where that’s necessary, and we’re not going to deny you that!\n\nBug fixes\n• We fixed a rare bug that could break the synchronization of budget data with the server. We don’t want it that way. We’re way more into having things N Sync.\n• We fixed a bug that resulted in an infinite loop when a user would try to open the Help tab if a page they were trying to access was filtered out with Screen Time content filters OR if that page was inaccessible or offline for other reasons. If you don’t know what an infinite loop is then you don’t know what an infinite loop is and then you just really don’t know what an infinite loop is until you realize that you don’t know what an infinite loop is...\n• When editing transactions in bulk, split subtransactions are included as items in the list and it was difficult to tell which transactions were split subtransactions and which ones were just regular transactions. We've now clearly marked the split subtransactions and disabled bulk categorization and swipe actions for these subtransactions, which before could lead to data loss.\n• We’re always careful to limit sync requests sent to the server to only sync on an “as needed” basis, because too many server hits can affect battery life and performance. But, we’ve added a few more syncing points for scheduled transactions and for uploading budget changes. This makes syncing data more reliable when switching between accounts or budgets. There will now be less occurences of some of that data going bye bye bye.","releaseDate":"2019-09-26"},{"versionDisplay":"2.9.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.9.1\nSearching and Fresh Starting and fixes, oh my!\n\nImprovements\n• Still haven't found what you're looking for? We've now added a search button at the top right of the transaction list, making search easier to find and easier to get to!\n• Ever go into YNAB to do a Fresh Start and get annoyed that all of the account balances are at zero? Well, we fixed that. Linked accounts now pull in account balances and the current day’s transactions.\n\nBug fixes\n• This may seem like a minor thing, but we fixed an issue where scheduled transactions wouldn't fire and notifications for those transactions wouldn't be shown, if the user didn't open the mobile app. The great thing about this fix is that now all of these things happen during background syncing, which paves the way for better YNAB notifications, in general, which will include pending transactions. Kind of a big deal.\n• At YNAB, we strive to make accessibility paramount when designing and developing features. With that in mind, this release fixes the \"New Category\" button, so that visually impaired YNABers who use VoiceOver can add categories.","releaseDate":"2019-09-03"},{"versionDisplay":"2.9","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.9\n• It's been a long time coming, but you can now search for transactions! You can search for categories, payees, amounts, memos, flags, and more! Gone are the days of going full on Where's Waldo looking for your transactions. With our new search feature, we'll find Waldo (your transactions) for you!\n\nImprovements\n• Payoff Balance by Date Goals for Credit Card Payments now count the budgeted amount carried over from the previous month (before the goal is created) as progress toward the goal. Before this update, if you had budgeted money for a credit card payment in the payment category, but you hadn’t applied the budgeted amount to pay down the debt yet, this category balance wasn’t counted towards the goal (if it was rolled over from a previous month). But now it will be. You're working hard to pay off those credit cards, so there's no reason to leave last month's budgeted amount off the table.","releaseDate":"2019-08-01"},{"versionDisplay":"2.8","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.8\n• On iOS 12.2 and later, the download size of the app has decreased by a few megabytes. That’s not nothing, as they say.\n\nImprovement\n• You can now disable TouchID or FaceID in the app if it’s disabled at the OS level. The option to disable used to be hidden from the UI if biometric ID was turned off system wide. No longer.\n• When scheduled transactions fire, we'll now attempt to match them to previously imported transactions. That's especially useful for transactions imported via the API.\n• When covering overspending by using the \"move money\" option in the budget inspector, we'll now correctly set that selected category as the destination and fill the amount to be covered.\n• We fixed a rare crash that could happen when trying to select a budget for the first time while the device is offline.\n• Bigger numbers could overflow to a second line when moving money which would look weird. Fixed now.","releaseDate":"2019-06-17"},{"versionDisplay":"2.7.2","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.7.2\n• Fixed a gnarly problem where the app could become unresponsive when trying to renew if your trial or subscription expired while on the budget screen.","releaseDate":"2019-05-27"},{"versionDisplay":"2.7.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.7.1\n  • You can now switch between budgets on offline devices. Since you're offline, you're limited to switching between budgets you've opened previously on that device.\n\nImprovements\n  • We’re less annoying when it comes to asking you to rate the app. Kindly take that into consideration.\n  • The account register got a nice little performance boost.\n  • We only show the credit spending bar graph on the credit card payment inspector if there’s been credit spending since the last payment. It quiets things down visually.\n  • New cash transactions are now cleared by default. That brings mobile in line with web’s existing behavior.\n  • We simplified the account editing flow.\n\nBug Fix\n  • The app badge number could disappear if the app hadn’t been opened for a bit. Our original fix of “open the app more often” didn’t seem to catch on, so we fixed it for real.","releaseDate":"2019-04-03"},{"versionDisplay":"2.7","releaseNotes":"What's New in v2.7\n• Keep your YNAB account secure with TouchID or FaceID. Use biometric authentication to access YNAB when you open the app or switch back to it after a few minutes. Enable it from the Settings menu.\n\nImprovements\n• The iPad transaction editor got embiggened, making it more pleasant to add/update transactions, as if adding/updating transactions weren't already pleasant enough.\n• You can now change the date of existing transactions to be in the future. Marty McFly urges caution.\n• You can now change the frequency of existing transactions, essentially using the existing transaction as a template for a new recurring transaction.\n• And now you can clear transaction categories. I don't suggest you do so, but—as you are no doubt thinking to yourself—I'm not the boss of you.\n• Using transfers in split transactions is now more straightforward and intuitive.\n• In the unlikely event you're logging in and get your email address or password incorrect several times in a row, for security reasons we ask you to wait a short time before trying again. The old message was cryptic, and frankly, not very helpful. The new one's much better. I hope you never see it.\n\nBug Fixes\n• For a few hours on either side of the turn of the month (depending on your timezone), Reports used the wrong month as \"current\". Fixed now.\n• Choosing a payee for a new split transaction no longer overwrites the category.\n• Fixed an exceedingly rare crash that could happen when processing transactions.","releaseDate":"2019-03-13"},{"versionDisplay":"2.6.3","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.6.3\n\nBug fixes\n• If you used “Enter Now” for a scheduled split then changed back to the originally scheduled date, you could end up with duplicate splits in some situations.

The powerful combination of award-winning apps and a proven method—YNAB’s Four Rules—has changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people by teaching them to get control of their finances, stop stressing, and live the life they want to live. \n\nA Proven Method—YNAB’s Four Rules \nRule One: Give Every Dollar A Job | Be intentional about what you want your money to do before you spend it. \n\nRule Two: Embrace Your True Expenses | Break up larger, less frequent expenses into smaller, manageable amounts. By saving monthly for insurance premiums, holidays, or car repairs, when the time comes, your money is ready and waiting to do its job.\n\nRule Three: Roll With The Punches | When life changes, so must your budget. Make adjustments and move along. Flexible budgets succeed because they’re guilt-free, realistic, and sustainable. \n\nRule Four: Age Your Money | As you repeat the first three rules, you’ll increase the time between earning a dollar and the moment you need to spend it. When your money is at least a month old, you’ll have finally broken the paycheck to paycheck cycle for good. \n\nFree for 30 Days, Then an Annual Subscription\n\nSubscription Details \n- YNAB is a

app/methodology/paradigm(s) have really revolutionized the way I approach my own finances and i cannot recommend it enough from that regard as a service \u0026 function. I have budgeted myself for well over a decade and have done alright, but always felt there was some missing piece or rather a “hole” that seemed to be getting in my way. This app/way of tagging and budgeting really helped me see in a very adult way, the ways in which I was failing to connect some financial dots and keep myself from doing as well as I should have been; it made sense after I really pressed myself to drop my bad thinking that I had developed to try and work around the natural holes in a standard budget logic.\n\nHaving said all of that, I find myself using my iPad Pro to access the web client, as the app itself is so kiddy and limited that it makes it actually harder to digest the information presented and make the most sense of it. So much information but it’s all so “big” that you can’t see the big picture, almost simply because the text and forms are so LARGE. Really the app could be and needs to be as feature-rich and dense as the web app; basically take the web app and adapt it to be touch targets and color coded like the app is. It could be so much BETTER than the web interface with all the screen real estate on the iPad and the easy entry and basic structure they have in place for it already.

I have never struggled to make rent or pay for my necessities, and I’ve stayed free of consumer debt. Because of YNAB I have been able to carefully weigh any debt I did take on (training for a career switch, a car) and pay it down without any stress. I clung stubbornly to the desktop app until I convinced my partner to start using it, and saw how far the web/mobile app had come, at which point I promptly switched over. I have a thing about app subscriptions (hate ‘em), but the YNAB team is consistently rolling out improvements and features, all of which have been rock solid and helped me plan for my financial future even better. It’s one of the rare cases where I get enough value from the service that I’m not only willing but HAPPY to pay to help the company grow. I could not recommend this app more highly. If you’ve ever struggled to save money or pay down debt, if you regularly get clobbered by predictable but irregular payments (6 month insurance premiums, replacing your computer/phone/car), if you need more accountability to make sure you’re spending your money in line with your values, there is nothing better on the market for helping you get there.","title":"Stable, Essential, Life Changing","userName":"Ula VL"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6957127920","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-05T14:06:03Z","rating":5,"review":"This is one of the best things I have ever done for myself. I have always lived paycheck to paycheck. It’s been very difficult for me to save, and when expenses would pop up, like car repairs, I would have high anxiety. I had tried making a budget for myself before, using various spreadsheets designed for budgeting, but most had me try to figure out what I would bring in in a year and what I would spend in that year. It was something I could never figure out very well or stick to. YNAB starts by only having you budget the money you have right now. Every dollar gets a job. It makes it so much more manageable. In just a short period of six months, I’ve gone from having debt, to a point where that debt is gone and I just reached 30 days of the age of my money, which gives me so much more choice and MUCH less anxiety.\n\nThe other great thing that sets this app apart is the help you receive. There are tons of online training sessions daily, and any time I hit a snag where I wasn’t sure how to handle something, I could get a hold of someone almost immediately who would walk me through the issue I was having. \n\nI would highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to get control of their personal finances and live a bit more at ease day to day.","title":"This app has changed my entire financial way of life","userName":"93Stephen"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6746488510","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-12-12T21:43:42Z","rating":5,"review":"I’ve always been so bad with my finances.

I canceled subscriptions that I rarely use and changed others to be more frugal where possible, and it’s going to save me nearly 10% of my income that I was essentially flushing down the toilet!

It has helped us tremendously with our budget and is easy to use. For me, the app is a bit smoother and simpler to use than the website. Here is my conundrum:  We use a small town bank that does not have direct download, so we have to manually download our transactions. I don’t want to fire up the laptop just to do this, as it doesn’t really take that long. So it goes, sign into bank website, download transactions, sign into YNAB website, which using an iPad means go to YNAB site, choose Request Desktop Site, then login, then import. \nUnderstandably, being it is a small bank, there may be no direct link in the near or distant future. I have no desire to move to another larger bank (there aren’t any close enough) that has direct link. So, I have one request, could we have a way to upload our manual transactions from the app instead of having to go through the website every time?

With the most recent update, the app went from feeling 8 years outdated and nearly unusable to one of the best-designed apps on my phone. I used to have to apologize for it - “if you can get over the outdated app, the system works really well” - and now I can wholeheartedly recommend the YNAB system to people who ask for help with budgeting.\n\nDon’t fall for the convenience of automated budget tracking with other apps! YNAB’s manual system forces you to pay attention to the consequences of every single purchase. The learning curve is difficult at first, and it does take an hour or two to get everything set up. But the payoff is literal - managing my money tightly with YNAB lets me spend more comfortably by making sure I have what I need for expenses and savings.

For some reason I have to constantly relink my discover accounts, I always have, but now that process which used to take seconds takes minutes every time. I’m not sure if Discover or ynab is to blame but the new server is significantly drawing out the process. Other accounts which have been historically not able to connect at all but maybe once a week (commerce bank) is showing as connected with the new server but is not actually syncing. So that’s confusing because at least with the older server it would tell me when it wasn’t synced and was so when it was I could rely on the information but now it’s not even telling me so I can’t rely on it at all ever, I just have to manually balance. \n\nIt’s unfortunate that this has happened because ynab was awesome, and still is but I am very hopeful they can work out the issues with the new server which seem to be pestering others besides myself according to reviews.","title":"New link server 👎🏻","userName":"scott\u0026julia"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5617882936","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-03-05T04:48:49Z","rating":4,"review":"I just switched away from a much deteriorated mvelopes, which I’ve used for years, and signed up for ynab. Overall, it is a much better implementation of a very similar and useful approach to budgeting— I really like it. Customer support is responsive, the interface is nice, and it nails all the essentials except for one thing— the way it handles reimbursements. I spend money for work costs in one month and am fully reimbursed the next. I never used to have to worry about it and it was useful for making sure I was capturing all my reimbursable expenses.  Whereas with mvelopes I used to be able to carry over that negative balance into the next month, which would resolve when I get paid, ynab forces the balance to zero when the month turns over and moves the debt into my credit card accounts. This in turn forces me to have to allocate my personal funds to cover expenses I know will be reimbursed, or track down where the debt was created and manually allocate the payment to my credit cards. It makes a simple process that should have no impact on my personal budget MUCH more complicated than it needs to be. Ynab says they are working on creating a dedicated reimbursement category to address this issue, and I will be 100% happy with ynab when they do.","title":"A significant upgrade from mvelopes but with

The powerful combination of award-winning apps and a proven method—YNAB’s Four Rules—has changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people by teaching them to get control of their finances, stop stressing, and live the life they want to live. \n\nA Proven Method—YNAB’s Four Rules \nRule One: Give Every Dollar A Job | Be intentional about what you want your money to do before you spend it. \n\nRule Two: Embrace Your True Expenses | Break up larger, less frequent expenses into smaller, manageable amounts. By saving monthly for insurance premiums, holidays, or car repairs, when the time comes, your money is ready and waiting to do its job.\n\nRule Three: Roll With The Punches | When life changes, so must your budget. Make adjustments and move along. Flexible budgets succeed because they’re guilt-free, realistic, and sustainable. \n\nRule Four: Age Your Money | As you repeat the first three rules, you’ll increase the time between earning a dollar and the moment you need to spend it. When your money is at least a month old, you’ll have finally broken the paycheck to paycheck cycle for good. \n\nFree for 30 Days, Then an Annual Subscription\n\nSubscription Details \n- YNAB is a one-year auto-renewable subscription, billed annually. \n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase.\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a\nsubscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of Use:\nhttps://www.youneedabudget.com/terms/?isolated\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.youneedabudget.com/privacy-policy/?isolated"},"versionHistory":[{"versionDisplay":"2.15.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.15.1\nToday’s release includes some infrastructure improvements that fall under the category of “nothing to see here.” But also some bug-fixes that fall under “you might have seen these”. With that, a few details:\n\n• We fixed an issue that could crash the app when assistive technologies like VoiceOver or Voice Control were enabled.\n• We also fixed an issue where the keyboard could cover text fields during sign-in (which, as you can imagine, was not at all helpful).\n• And we fixed a bug where going back to a device or budget that hadn’t been synced in a while could cause scheduled transactions to enter the budget when they shouldn’t.\n• Speaking of scheduled transactions, “Enter Now” wasn’t working correctly 100% of the time with scheduled transfers—but now it does.\n• Also, we cleaned up some issues with the animations that happen when approving transactions.\n• Finally, the new iOS 14 widgets are now longer cut off when Display Zoom is enabled.","releaseDate":"2021-02-22"},{"versionDisplay":"2.15","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.15\nWith the new year comes a new YNAB update! \n\nNew feature:\n• We’re releasing support for iOS 14 widgets!

Fewer loading screens = more time for the finer things in life, like reading these release notes.\n• Previously, you could only use Enter Now on one scheduled transaction at a time. No longer! Bulk enter to your heart’s content.\n\nBug fixes\n• We fixed an issue where, under some circumstances, you might see the category balance for the current month rather than the affected month when choosing the category for, and saving,  past transactions. No, we are not warping the space-time continuum (yet).\n• We fixed a bug on iOS 14 where tapping the “spent” amount on iPad would not show the category activity. You’ll see it now, never fear.\n• In the past, occasionally the Overspent Categories banner on iPad wouldn’t show the correct number of overspent categories.

Previously, we only showed an alert icon and messaging saying: \"Transaction Import Failed, Resolve errors to retry.\" We now break this error status down into more useful messages such as \"Delayed, This issue usually resolves itself\", \"Reauthorize, To continue importing transactions\", \"Blocked, Learn more\", and a few others.\n• We've now made it possible to leave the transaction editor by swiping down on its title bar in all cases.\n\nBug fixes\n• We fixed a couple of cosmetic issues when swiping left on transactions on iOS 12.","releaseDate":"2020-08-17"},{"versionDisplay":"2.13.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.13.1\n\nWe’ve pushed out a handful of bug-fixes just in time for Summer! Maybe “handful” isn’t the right measurement. Maybe it is. Either way, they’re big hands, because they also did some meaningful behind-the-scenes infrastructural work as well. I feel weird that we’re still talking about hands now. Anyway, here are just a few of the bug-fixes that we did for this release:\n\nBug Fixes\n• We’ve fixed a bug that sometimes sent users to the budget switcher when starting the app, even though a budget was open when they last left the app. That’s like when you accidentally pull out your bookmark from the book you’re reading, which is super frustrating...which is why I dog-ear my pages...I know...I’M A MONSTER!!!\n• We’ve fixed a bug where the app would sometimes crash while starting up. Safety first! No one likes crashing.\n• We’ve fixed a bug where uploading an image in the support chat could sometimes crash the app. Yeah...that sounds like the opposite of how awesome our Support team is. “Oh...you need help with your budget? [image uploading]...and...oh...looks like YNAB crashed, and thanks for reaching out.” Fortunately, this is all fixed.","releaseDate":"2020-07-06"},{"versionDisplay":"2.13","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.13\nYou’ve heard of #lifegoals and maybe even #squadgoals, but what about #goalgoals?! Well, in this latest release, YNAB has fulfilled everyone’s #goalgoals by taking goals in YNAB to the next level. When setting goals in YNAB you’ll now have quite a few more options to help you accomplish all of your #moneygoals.\n\nImprovements\n[extreme Andrés Cantor voice] GoooooooooOOOOOOOOaaaaaaAAAAAlllllllllLLLLs\n• We added new “goal type selection” for increased clarity on which type of goal to use and when.\n• You can now set a target day of the month for Monthly goals.\n• There is also now a Weekly goal option where you can target a day of the week.\n• Lastly, we’ve also extended the By Date goals to allow selecting an exact target date. You can also (optionally) repeat goals every n months/years. And “n” in this case stands for number...I think...or maybe just months that start with “n”...November? Napril? Hmmm....\n------------------\n• We've now made it possible to collapse all scheduled transactions so you can decide whether you want to see them in your accounts or not. I wish I could literally and existentially just collapse my scheduled auto insurance bills.\n• You thought we were done talking about goals, didn’t you. Nope! YNAB will now show more information about how budgeting a negative amount affects a Target Balance By Date goal.\n• We changed the behavior for configuring notifications to always be consistent. You can now always configure your notifications from the Settings menu.\n\nBug fixes\n• This was just a small tweak, but now all transactions align vertically perfectly in the Accounts tab...or at least they’re more perfect...perfecter?\n• We fixed a rare crash that happened when going into split screen multitasking on iPad while reordering accounts. Listen, you multitasking YNABers, we get it. You want to do everything at once and we salute you, but give us time to catch up to your prolificness!\n• If you enabled larger accessibility text sizes in your iOS Settings, the payee wouldn't show in the transaction editor, but we fixed this particular issue.","releaseDate":"2020-06-17"},{"versionDisplay":"2.12.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.12.1\nOnce again, our developers have put on their bug-fixing pants (and pantsuits) to go-a-bug-wranglin’. And you’re all like, “why do you need to wear specific pants to fix bugs?” Hey, maybe don’t worry about how the bug-fixing sausage is made or how we just freely mix all sorts of metaphors together all willy-nilly. Just check out these sweet, sweet results:\n\n- Bug fixes\n• In some cases, the Create Goal button in the category details wouldn’t show up due to specific layout constraints. If it wasn’t showing up for you, it should now after this release.\n\n• Nearby payees can now be manually removed again without having to forget their location...or without having to choose to “forget their location.” Who among us wants to remember going to the DMV?\n\n• We fixed a rare issue where you could sometimes end up in an empty budget state on your phone while changing your password on web at the same time. No, this wasn’t an experimental Rule 5 - Transport Your Budget To An Alternate Dimension bit of code we were testing out. That hasn’t been released yet.\n\n• Fixed an edge case that would allow a transfer payee to get a geo location. For online banks that was probably extra creepy (your bank is calling from inside your house???) but it’s been fixed now!\n\n• We fixed a bug where the username and password input fields would be hidden behind the keyboard after returning to the app during login. Probably the most boring game of hide and seek ever, but that shouldn’t happen anymore.\n\n• On the iPhone SE, we fixed an issue where the notes field in the transaction editor would be hidden by the keyboard. Man. That keyboard is cramping our style. What are you trying to hide, keyboard?!\n\n• Fixed a rare crash when using Quick Budget. Um...that wasn’t what we meant by “Quick Budget.”\n\n• As part of our continued effort to make the web/mobile experiences more cohesive, we updated the icon for \"Account Settings\" to match what we have on web. Where we used to have a little \"settings panel\" icon, we now have a little \"user\" icon.","releaseDate":"2020-04-16"},{"versionDisplay":"2.12","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.12\nYou've signed in with a password and you may have signed in with Google, but I don't think you've truly lived until you've signed in with Apple. And now, with this release, you can (sign in with Apple)! Just think of how convenient it will be to not have to remember your password every time you go into YNAB to give dollars jobs. The future has truly arrived...or, at least, this is a nice-to-have feature for all of you die hard Apple fans...are we calling you AppleHeads™? I am now. We've also pushed some nice bug-fixes for all of you hard core (I know what I did there) AppleHeads™:\n\nImprovements\n• When you go to delete a category with transactions, we will now show you a warning explaining the risks and offer to hide the categories instead. I believe it was either Sir Winston Churchill or maybe Spiderman’s uncle who said, \"with great power comes great responsibility\"...but also, it doesn't hurt to throw in a courtesy warning modal with that power too.\n\nBug fixes\n• Fixed an iPad crash in iOS 12 when tapping the \"More\" menu button while editing transactions...and you thought we meant MORE crashes. Nope! \n• Fixed a crash that happened after doing a Fresh Start. Hopefully now, though, only your money stress levels will crash after doing a Fresh Start to go out there and get it with your financial goals. You can do this!...especially now that the app isn't crashing.\n• Fixed an issue where the To Be Budgeted banner on iPad would sometimes show as green when the amount was 0.\n• Fixed an issue where the Overspent Categories banner sometimes displayed a count of 0. This was a bug and NOT a Minority Report-style \"Precog\" feature where we tell you that you have overspent categories before you have them. Whew.\n• Fixed the toolbar layout for approving or categorizing transactions.\n• Fixed an issue where the scroll indicator never reached the bottom of the table on the Budget, Accounts and Transaction screens\n\nUntil next time, AppleHeads™...","releaseDate":"2020-03-19"},{"versionDisplay":"2.11.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.11.1\nSo, it looks like all of our iOS developers woke up on January 1st and made a New Year's resolution to completely eradicate all bugs and possibly even the memory of bugs existing as a thing. I don't know if maybe they watched A Bug's Life or Antz or that Jerry Seinfeld movie with bees, and just said, \"who do these guys even think they are with their legs and wings, swimming in raindrops and ruining picnics?!!!\" But then, instead of taking out actual bugs, they just went ham on getting rid of a ton of bugs for this release. Whatever the case may be, we fixed a TON of bugs:\n\n• Fixed a rare issue where the app could get stuck loading on launch...just like how real bugs sometimes get stuck loading up on lunch.\n• On the iPad, we fixed some cases where the budget tab would show a different month after switching back to the app or resizing it. To be clear, a different \"month\" was showing up, not a different \"moth.\" Moths are terrifying the way they dive bomb your lantern when you're camping at night. Sorry, we’ll stop talking about real bugs now.\n• We made it so the actions on the transaction toolbar are now all accessible in all multitasking modes and orientations. BTW, Multitasking is new. Now it’s new and improved!\n• Fixed a bug where sometimes subcategories were not able to be reordered until after an app restart. Not ideal, but now that restart shouldn’t be necessary!\n• Replaced \"Add Transaction\" with \"Record Payment\" in context menus for debt categories. This wasn’t just a text swap. There is now an appropriate behavior that happens as well, such as the cursor going to the outflow field.\n• Fixed a bug where if you had a By Date goal and the target date had already passed, we weren't letting you save changes to a category! Whoops! Fixed now.\n• Changed the flow for covering overspending on iPad using the red pill. Now it goes straight to a filtered list of categories to cover the overspending with. Unfortunately, this has nothing to do with Keanu Reeves choosing to leave the Matrix to become a grown-up man fetus who gets flushed down a robot toilet...sounds maybe a little strange out-of-context...\n• Cleaned up icons, simplified color schemes and did some minor animation fixes. Nothing major here, but it will pave the way for possible improvements to colors, icons and animations in the future.\n• Fixed the top of the empty state text being cut off in the payee selection screen. Was the full state half empty, or was the empty state half full? Now, we’ll never know.\n• Fixed an issue where the nearby payee was not defaulted when creating a new transaction before the device location is loaded. But let’s be honest, it’s usually Amazon, Target or Costco #AmIRight?\n• Previously, when tapping and holding on a section header, the context menu came up for the first cell in the section, making it difficult to reorder groups. This prevented context menus from popping up on budget section headers and also on all cells while editing. But we fixed this.\n• Fixed a crash when unmatching transactions on iPad.\n• Fixed a rare crash when reordering category groups...and hey, no one likes crashes, except I remember that movie, “Crash” winning best picture or something. Also, that Dave Matthews song was OK. Other than that, though, crashes are universally not liked.","releaseDate":"2020-02-10"},{"versionDisplay":"2.11","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.11\n2020. We're here. THE FUTURE!!!! And we are so ready for 2020 with this release. In honor of basically all of us now being in Bladerunner (the Harrison Ford one...well, maybe the Ryan Gosling one...who knows?) this new version of YNAB supports screen rotation and split-view/slide-over multitasking on iPad. I know. We're pretty much just all cyborgs at this point. Talk about a futuristic feature: with multitasking, you can have YNAB open on one side of your iPad and have Amazon open on the other side, looking at all of your purchases trying to figure out what that $5.49 charge was...socks? A single light bulb?...that might explain why the future is so bright...\n\nImprovements\n• When a user creates a split transaction, but then only enters a single category, we used to just send over the category information into a flattened single transaction. With this release, we now preserve all data from that split transaction (amount and memo) and bring it over to the single parent transaction. Split it and forget it is what we like to say...nope...that's not a thing.\n\nBug fixes\n• We did a tweak to fix a bug where keypad button presses didn't always register if users moved their fingers slightly while tapping a button. Look, we're not saying you're a sloppy typer. We've all been over-excited to enter in a vacation savings goal or a transaction for a gift for a friend. Either way, you're covered now.\n• We fixed a few cases of horizontal scrolling and/or cutoff side margins on iPad popovers where the arrow is on the right or left.\n• We also fixed an issue where the bottom of the hidden categories list gets cut off. We said \"hidden,\" not cut in half!!!\n• Raise your hand if you hate unexpected crashes...oh, literally everyone hates this...we do too. So, we fixed an issue that was causing crashes when the app was attempting to present an action sheet on the transaction list popover. Whew. We're so glad that everyone raised their hands there. Crashes are the worst.","releaseDate":"2020-01-13"},{"versionDisplay":"2.10.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.10.1\n\nWhat’s that smell? Is it frankincense? Lutefisk? Nope! It’s a whole bunch of yuletide bug-fixes and improvements that we’ve dropped just in time for the Holidays:\n\n• We’ve improved our integration with password managers. In particular, we now use iCloud key sharing, if you want to share credentials between the web and mobile app. Oh, what fun it is to login to YNAB without having to remember your password in a one-horse open (but secure) sleigh.\n• We improved the transaction details area, so that it no longer does any annoying horizontal scrolling. Hark! The horizontal angel of scrolling will no longer sing! Also, we don’t use the word “hark” enough. Let’s make that a thing.\n• Hark!...actually more like, “dark!” We fixed the text color for matched transactions that looked a little blurry in Dark Mode. “Was that letter an L or an I?” Now, you’ll know that there was “No L, Noooo L, No L, Noooooo LL.” I’ll see myself out.\n• We fixed an issue that involved the timing for when we ask for biometric authentication again. What more can we do? Baby, all we want for Christmas is...proper biometric authentication timing.\n• Alright, so remember how the matched transaction text was blurry for Dark Mode and then we fixed it? Well, our flag images were also a little blurry as well. And we’ve now fixed those flag images to be nice and crisp...like a winter day...like a winter wonderland, even?\n• There was an issue when using voiceover for frequency selection in the Repeat field. But we fixed it, and now things can be said many times, many ways…\n• We made the transaction screen button animations smoother. And by that, I mean we made them so they actually animate now. Hallelujah!\n\nAnd, with that, I know you’re tired of our Holiday-themed release notes, so we’ll just end by wishing you a Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and a Happy New Year from all of us at YNAB!","releaseDate":"2019-12-11"},{"versionDisplay":"2.10","releaseNotes":"You know how the old saying goes: the darker the mode, the sweeter the budgeting. That's totally not a thing anyone has ever said, but perhaps it will be? With this release, we've gone dark. Yep. We added Dark Mode to your favorite budgeting app. Some of you might be wondering if it will still be as satisfying to move money and crush debt in the dark...we think it will be! Don't be afraid of the dark! Give YNAB's new Dark Mode a try! And when you're ready to turn the light back on, check out some of the other bug fixes and improvements that we've made in this release:\n\nWhat’s new\n• Dark Mode - I can't stress enough how deliciously dark YNAB is now. It's at least 100% darker than our normal mode.\n• iOS 13 Context Menus - We've taken advantage of this helpful, new iOS 13 feature. Now you can do literally dozens of contextually appropriate actions in the budget view, account view and transaction lists. These menus will save you time by doing all sorts of things like pre-populating the appropriate category when adding transaction or giving you the ability to add or edit goals in the contextually appropriate category.\n\nBug fixes\n• We fixed a budget reorder issue...well, actually it was two issues. When reordering the top budget group in a budget table, the other budget views would get pushed all the way down. Even worse than that, though, was if you only had two budget groups, the reordering would appear to work, but upon refreshing the table, it would revert back to the order it was in. We fixed these issues and order (or reorder) has been restored to the universe...er, your budget.\n• In iOS 13, there was a cursor issue when YNABers were going in to edit a budget category. You would have to delete the category name in order to get the cursor to move from the beginning of the text field. We went ahead and fixed that, so that should be an improvement upon a cursory reassessment of your budget categories...is that what 'cursory' means?\n• We recently added the search feature to our iOS app, and it's pretty great. But also, there was a small issue...when users were tapping the \"Cancel\" button to cancel their search, the \"Cancel\" button wasn't going away. It was overstaying its welcome. Well, \"Cancel\" button, I hate to tell you this, but after you've been tapped, that's really all that we need from you. You're great. We love what you do, but when you cancel something, you really just need to go away until we need you again. Oh, also, we didn't just tell the \"Cancel\" button to go away. We actually fixed the issue.\n• We were able to fix an issue where the bottom tab bar would disappear in some cases when YNABers were moving money or editing transactions. We've got to give a huge shout out to our new mobile developer, Itai, on a lot of these fixes. He came into a world where we've got buttons not disappearing when they should and tab bars disappearing when they shouldn't and he totally wrangled these disappearing/reappearing problem children and put them back in line. Thanks, Itai!","releaseDate":"2019-11-13"},{"versionDisplay":"2.9.3","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.9.3\n\nThis release contains fixes to some bugs related to our 3rd-party messaging platform. Did someone say \"party?\" Yes we did. Feel free to celebrate this release with us!","releaseDate":"2019-10-07"},{"versionDisplay":"2.9.2","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.9.2\n\nOh, don’t mind us...we’ve just been busy polishing and bug fixing split transactions and sync issues for this past release. Here are some of the changes we’ve made to keep your YNAB experience as smooth as possible:\n\nImprovements\n• We “KonMari’d” and decluttered the \"Edit\" mode for reordering accounts. For starters, the button now says \"Reorder\" instead of \"Edit,\" which is clearer. But we also now hide the Notification Permission section, transaction banners and the Manage section. We left only the UI pieces necessary that will bring you reordering joy. The other UI pieces for that mode have been taken to the local Goodwill.\n• In Account Settings, we added the ability to allow external \"Learn More\" style links to open in Mobile Safari.\n• If you create a split transaction with a single subtransaction on the web we'll now display that correctly...we’re not 100% sure why you would want to do that, but you may have some system you use where that’s necessary, and we’re not going to deny you that!\n\nBug fixes\n• We fixed a rare bug that could break the synchronization of budget data with the server. We don’t want it that way. We’re way more into having things N Sync.\n• We fixed a bug that resulted in an infinite loop when a user would try to open the Help tab if a page they were trying to access was filtered out with Screen Time content filters OR if that page was inaccessible or offline for other reasons. If you don’t know what an infinite loop is then you don’t know what an infinite loop is and then you just really don’t know what an infinite loop is until you realize that you don’t know what an infinite loop is...\n• When editing transactions in bulk, split subtransactions are included as items in the list and it was difficult to tell which transactions were split subtransactions and which ones were just regular transactions. We've now clearly marked the split subtransactions and disabled bulk categorization and swipe actions for these subtransactions, which before could lead to data loss.\n• We’re always careful to limit sync requests sent to the server to only sync on an “as needed” basis, because too many server hits can affect battery life and performance. But, we’ve added a few more syncing points for scheduled transactions and for uploading budget changes. This makes syncing data more reliable when switching between accounts or budgets. There will now be less occurences of some of that data going bye bye bye.","releaseDate":"2019-09-26"},{"versionDisplay":"2.9.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.9.1\nSearching and Fresh Starting and fixes, oh my!\n\nImprovements\n• Still haven't found what you're looking for? We've now added a search button at the top right of the transaction list, making search easier to find and easier to get to!\n• Ever go into YNAB to do a Fresh Start and get annoyed that all of the account balances are at zero? Well, we fixed that. Linked accounts now pull in account balances and the current day’s transactions.\n\nBug fixes\n• This may seem like a minor thing, but we fixed an issue where scheduled transactions wouldn't fire and notifications for those transactions wouldn't be shown, if the user didn't open the mobile app. The great thing about this fix is that now all of these things happen during background syncing, which paves the way for better YNAB notifications, in general, which will include pending transactions. Kind of a big deal.\n• At YNAB, we strive to make accessibility paramount when designing and developing features. With that in mind, this release fixes the \"New Category\" button, so that visually impaired YNABers who use VoiceOver can add categories.","releaseDate":"2019-09-03"},{"versionDisplay":"2.9","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.9\n• It's been a long time coming, but you can now search for transactions! You can search for categories, payees, amounts, memos, flags, and more! Gone are the days of going full on Where's Waldo looking for your transactions. With our new search feature, we'll find Waldo (your transactions) for you!\n\nImprovements\n• Payoff Balance by Date Goals for Credit Card Payments now count the budgeted amount carried over from the previous month (before the goal is created) as progress toward the goal. Before this update, if you had budgeted money for a credit card payment in the payment category, but you hadn’t applied the budgeted amount to pay down the debt yet, this category balance wasn’t counted towards the goal (if it was rolled over from a previous month). But now it will be. You're working hard to pay off those credit cards, so there's no reason to leave last month's budgeted amount off the table.","releaseDate":"2019-08-01"},{"versionDisplay":"2.8","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.8\n• On iOS 12.2 and later, the download size of the app has decreased by a few megabytes. That’s not nothing, as they say.\n\nImprovement\n• You can now disable TouchID or FaceID in the app if it’s disabled at the OS level. The option to disable used to be hidden from the UI if biometric ID was turned off system wide. No longer.\n• When scheduled transactions fire, we'll now attempt to match them to previously imported transactions. That's especially useful for transactions imported via the API.\n• When covering overspending by using the \"move money\" option in the budget inspector, we'll now correctly set that selected category as the destination and fill the amount to be covered.\n• We fixed a rare crash that could happen when trying to select a budget for the first time while the device is offline.\n• Bigger numbers could overflow to a second line when moving money which would look weird. Fixed now.","releaseDate":"2019-06-17"},{"versionDisplay":"2.7.2","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.7.2\n• Fixed a gnarly problem where the app could become unresponsive when trying to renew if your trial or subscription expired while on the budget screen.","releaseDate":"2019-05-27"},{"versionDisplay":"2.7.1","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.7.1\n  • You can now switch between budgets on offline devices. Since you're offline, you're limited to switching between budgets you've opened previously on that device.\n\nImprovements\n  • We’re less annoying when it comes to asking you to rate the app. Kindly take that into consideration.\n  • The account register got a nice little performance boost.\n  • We only show the credit spending bar graph on the credit card payment inspector if there’s been credit spending since the last payment. It quiets things down visually.\n  • New cash transactions are now cleared by default. That brings mobile in line with web’s existing behavior.\n  • We simplified the account editing flow.\n\nBug Fix\n  • The app badge number could disappear if the app hadn’t been opened for a bit. Our original fix of “open the app more often” didn’t seem to catch on, so we fixed it for real.","releaseDate":"2019-04-03"},{"versionDisplay":"2.7","releaseNotes":"What's New in v2.7\n• Keep your YNAB account secure with TouchID or FaceID. Use biometric authentication to access YNAB when you open the app or switch back to it after a few minutes. Enable it from the Settings menu.\n\nImprovements\n• The iPad transaction editor got embiggened, making it more pleasant to add/update transactions, as if adding/updating transactions weren't already pleasant enough.\n• You can now change the date of existing transactions to be in the future. Marty McFly urges caution.\n• You can now change the frequency of existing transactions, essentially using the existing transaction as a template for a new recurring transaction.\n• And now you can clear transaction categories. I don't suggest you do so, but—as you are no doubt thinking to yourself—I'm not the boss of you.\n• Using transfers in split transactions is now more straightforward and intuitive.\n• In the unlikely event you're logging in and get your email address or password incorrect several times in a row, for security reasons we ask you to wait a short time before trying again. The old message was cryptic, and frankly, not very helpful. The new one's much better. I hope you never see it.\n\nBug Fixes\n• For a few hours on either side of the turn of the month (depending on your timezone), Reports used the wrong month as \"current\". Fixed now.\n• Choosing a payee for a new split transaction no longer overwrites the category.\n• Fixed an exceedingly rare crash that could happen when processing transactions.","releaseDate":"2019-03-13"},{"versionDisplay":"2.6.3","releaseNotes":"What’s New in v2.6.3\n\nBug fixes\n• If you used “Enter Now” for a scheduled split then changed back to the originally scheduled date, you could end up with duplicate splits in some situations.
