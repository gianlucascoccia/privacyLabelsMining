      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been struggling to keep up with all the new benefits that the card companies initiated last Spring when we became home bodies. I also realized that I was not able to remember or efficienctly look up card benefits or point maximazing choice of card, despite being very familiar with several blogs, websites and services devoted to points. I was so happy to find this app! I no longer worry that I’m missing out on a great use of cards. I no longer fret about which card to take shopping, or which card to use online, or when I have a deadline or any number of variables that plague us. The app is time consuming to set up if you have a lot of cards, but worth it, if you want to use it to keep track of minimal spend as you acquire cards. But, that said, adding cards is a snap and I’m sure as I add cards and delete old ones, that I will use this app to track all my cards. It is a perfect compliment to other card following sites and services, as none of those put this very necessary info at your fingertips. Lastly, the developer is incredibly available and responsive. So refreshing.</p>

</h3>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is phenomenal. There is no simplified app like this out there that does what this does. Believe me-I had been looking for a long time.  Besides the clean, simple, very accurate (super important) information it contains, the customer service is outstanding. <br /><br />I had a question, wrote to Emmanuel.  He wrote back right away.  Then, to make it even more rare for anything customer service related these days... he wrote me back a week later just to double check I got things figured out.  (Btw-It wasn’t a problem with the app-it was a separate question regarding Apple and the new iOS) <br /><br />I could not recommend this app any more for those who have a lot of credit cards, and find it hard to make sure to not only use them enough to not get them closed for inactivity-but to make sure you are using the correct card to maximize your rewards.  The bonus is this app will let you keep track of your limit, when you opened the card, the apr, and other data points related to the cards-it even has opening bonus information for the cards.  <br /><br />This is new and although it is already off to such a great start-I can’t wait to see what becomes of this in the future.  I am a member of a few credit websites and I have posted info on this app to the members.  I have never done that with a product nor do I write reviews.  This is how highly recommended this app is. <br />A Plus/5 Stars.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is a great resource for people who have a lot of credit cards and are usually unsure of which one is best for each individual purchase. Credit card companies and banks are notorious for having bad apps or hard-to-understand websites and this app definitely fills a niche for those users.<br /><br />I also want to highlight the quick work and amiability of the developer. I noticed that a couple of my cards had incorrect information. After contacting the developer, he had a fix for it within a day without even requiring an app update and he responded back personally with that information and a thank you for using the app and pointing out the error.<br /><br />This app is brand new and is already serving as both a solid utility as well as a good iOS citizen. More apps need to be like this one.</p>

help you save even more money through the newly-added Amex, Bank of America, Citi, and Chase offers, there have been a few great new features added in this update:\n\n* It is now possible to track offers which can be used multiple times, in addition to spend tracking.\n\n* You will receive a notification when your snoozed offers become current to help make sure you use all of them and save the most money.\n\n* Tap and hold on any offer notification from the app for more options -- Snooze for 1 (More) Day or Redeem Offer -- without having to even open the app.\n\n* Tapping on any notification will now take you directly to that card or offer in the app.\n\n* Pinning a card to the top of a category is now even easier -- there's a new section in the Customize Pointers page of the app's Settings screen where you can manage all of your pinned cards.\n\n* Adding a new card will now immediately load up the current standard offers and allow you to add personal or custom ones.\n\n* A few more performance improvements because it's not just money that I want to help you save.\n\nThank you for your continued support, and if you have a personal American Express Platinum card,

Shortcuts include CMD-C to jump to My Cards, CMD-O to jump to My Offers (if offered by your cards), and CMD-1 through CMD-9 to jump to your top 9 category pointers; you can view the full list throughout the app by holding down the CMD key for one second.\n\n* Wouldn’t it be great if that keyboard had an escape key like the pretty-perfect new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air? If your muscle memory is anything like mine, you’ll be relieved to see that the backtick key (`) has been mapped to close all of the modals throughout the app. (Pro tip: you can also map any of the modifier keys to escape now through the Settings app). You can also use the standard escape key if you're lucky enough to have one, CMD-W, or CMD-. (John Gruber's favorite).\n\n* The bottom half of that Magic Keyboard will be even handier now, too, thanks to some big improvements in the styling and effects from the hover states throughout the app while using a trackpad or mouse for iPadOS 13.4+ users.\n\n* And finally, many database updates detailing the generous offers from American Express, Chase, and Citibank, featuring new statement credits and spend bonuses across the categories that matter most right now to help us get through the pandemic. To help you make the most of these new offers you can also choose to badge the app icon now through the Settings app to show you how many offers are currently available to you.\n\nI hope that all of

benefits that the card companies initiated last Spring when we became home bodies. I also realized that I was not able to remember or efficienctly look up card benefits or point maximazing choice of card, despite being very familiar with several blogs, websites and services devoted to points. I was so happy to find this app! I no longer worry that I’m missing out on a great use of cards. I no longer fret about which card to take shopping, or which card to use online, or when I have a deadline or any number of variables that plague us. The app is time consuming to set up if you have a lot of cards, but worth it, if you want to use it to keep track of minimal spend as you acquire cards. But, that said, adding cards is a snap and I’m sure as I add cards and delete old ones, that I will use this app to track all my cards. It is a perfect compliment to other card following sites and services, as none of those put this very necessary info at your fingertips. Lastly, the developer is incredibly available and responsive. So refreshing.","title":"Fills a gap, absolutely necessary to maximize benefits!","userName":"LKreviews18"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4915391650","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-10-09T22:25:17Z","rating":5,"review":"This is phenomenal. There is no simplified app like this out there that does what this does. Believe me-I had been looking for a long time.  Besides the clean, simple, very accurate (super important) information it contains, the customer service is outstanding. \n\nI had a question, wrote to Emmanuel.  He wrote back right away.  Then, to make it even more rare for anything customer service related these days... he wrote me back a week later just to double check I got things figured out.  (Btw-It wasn’t a problem with the app-it was a separate question regarding Apple and the new iOS) \n\nI could not recommend this app any more for those who have a lot of credit cards, and find it hard to make sure to not only use them enough to not get them closed for inactivity-but to make sure you are using the correct card to maximize your rewards.  The bonus is this app will let you keep track of your limit, when you opened the card, the apr, and other data points related to the cards-it even has opening bonus information for the cards.  \n\nThis is new and although it is already off to such a great start-I can’t wait to see what becomes of this in the future.  I am a member of a few credit websites and I have posted info on this app to the members.  I have never done that with a product nor do I write reviews.

I noticed that a couple of my cards had incorrect information. After contacting the developer, he had a fix for it within a day without even requiring an app update and he responded back personally with that information and a thank you for using the app and pointing out the error.\n\nThis app is brand new and is already serving as both a solid utility as well as a good iOS citizen.

This app is just what the doctor ordered.  \n\nI haven’t even had it for 2 hours yet and I have been emailing back and forth with the developer, Emmanuel, and he has already fixed or made note to fix every issue I reported. That’s got to be some kind of record because I’m used to devs that take days to respond seemingly without actually reading what I sent them. \n\nI also really like that it shows you the best offers to sign up for new cards. I’m currently in timeout on new card apps because the cards I want require me to go a period of time without new ones but when I’m ready, the information on sign up offers and the application will be a tap or two away. \n\nIf you have a card that has rotating categories like the Discover IT card, the categories in CardPointers will be updated accordingly. Like I noticed that restaurants are 5% right now, something I forgot about this quarter. \n\nI don’t really use Siri much but I am sure that functionality will appeal to many. \n\nIf you use rewards credit cards, you’re doing yourself a disservice by not checking out CardPointers!","title":"Great app and friendly dev!","userName":"Saeren."},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5899115962","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-05-03T21:57:01Z","developerResponse":{"id":15136369,"body":"So happy to hear that you love the app, thanks for taking the time to leave a rating + review!

Just open the app, add your credit cards and you can see which credit card you need to use for what. \n\nAnother best feature of the app is that it shows points-to-dollar value for every credit card.

This update includes a total re-thinking of how offers integrate into your life, and in the app. Here’s what’s new:\n\n* Every type of offer in the app can now be progressively tracked with an easy-to-use slider (and tap and hold on the offer for some other neat tricks!)\n\n* The Offers widget, Offers section of the dashboard, Offers page on the Watch, and the headers of each of the Offers pages now show information about how much credit you have left with each offer, rather than just the full amount of the offer.\n\n* Offers related to categories and subcategories or specific merchants now appear inline throughout the Pointers section, to help make your buying decisions a cinch - on the same screen you can immediately see your top offer for that purchase, as well as the best card to use. And now subcategories also include deals from your offers, and not just the ones where you have spend bonuses.\n\n* Sign up Bonus offer tracking via the Offers page, Card Details page, and prioritized as a related offer in the inline offer section detailed above. The welcome bonus is what most people should focus on meeting first so that is pushed to the top of your related offers, but if you feel differently, you can disable that in the Customize Pointers screen.\n\n* With either type of offer, you don’t have to whip out a calculator app if you just made a purchase for $14.28 and want to track it — just tap and hold on the offer, choose “Add Amount”, enter it in and the app will do the math for you. You can also choose “Set Amount” to enter specific amounts.\n\n* Speaking of data entry, everywhere that you see a +/- stepper in the app to configure values like point values, you can now just tap and hold then type in the value you want to set. This should be a real timesaver when you’re setting up custom categories or editing your card details.\n\n* Sign up Bonus redemptions can now be fully tracked in the app as well, and the redemption date will be stored in the app (particularly useful information for meeting new bonuses on a card which you had in the past — I’ve got some ideas to make that even easier in the future, too).\n\n* New widget to track your Chase Card Eligibility (5/24 status) for Pro members.\n\nAs always, thank you so much for your support over the last year since I launched the app, and all of the great reviews; I read all of your emails and reply to every one, and I'm so happy to be able to work on this app and help make your lives a bit better by saving you money and helping you to earn more cash back and points.\n","releaseDate":"2020-12-04"},{"versionDisplay":"1.0.1","releaseNotes":"* Updated app icon to feel right at home on Big

(John Gruber's favorite).\n\n* The bottom half of that Magic Keyboard will be even handier now, too, thanks to some big improvements in the styling and effects from the hover states throughout the app while using a trackpad or mouse for iPadOS 13.4+ users.\n\n* And finally, many database updates detailing the generous offers from American Express, Chase, and Citibank, featuring new statement credits and spend bonuses across the categories that matter most right now to help us get through the pandemic. To help you make the most of these new offers you can also choose to badge the app icon now through the Settings app to show you how many offers are currently available to you.\n\nI hope that all of these changes will help make life at least a little bit better and easier in these hard times, and thank you again for using CardPointers.","releaseDate":"2020-05-03"}],"languageList":["English"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"privacyPolicyUrl":"https://getcardpointers.com/privacy/","requirementsString":"Requires iOS 14.0 and watchOS 7.0 or later.
