      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So after playing game of war and mobile strike and knowing you got to pay to play which was ok at first tell they drop new updates every day instead of once every couple weeks to let others catch up. Well this game gives you so much more then having to buy pack after pack. If you do the task you get some great rewards which helps free to play players. Sometimes I buy sometimes I don’t and yet I’m still managing to score within top 10 of the whole city where I’m at. <br />The only thing I have questions and concerns is the gold payouts on rewards for individual event or hell event should be a little more. Also in daily crime if you rank in top 50 you should be able to get more then 80 gold. Now that comes with buying packs for others to score top 3 where the gold payout is way better. Anyways been playing close to 2 years and don’t want to touch another game. Mafia city keep the great work up. Don’t let greed overtake such a good game for passing time. But do offer more gold for event wins and more speed ups. Also more events with gold tickets or coins to use for combine vouchers would be awesome too. Thank u all for developing a one bad to the bone game.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I would have to say this is been one of the greatest games I’ve played in a while. I have been playing since he 18 close to two years now. There are some issues that I’ve noticed and I’m late for major issues. I enjoyed the game so much I created many different accounts to keep me going for extra Parmesan everything else. But as of late every single account has now been on banded and I have no way to get into them and I have no way to start A new one. I do not remember what cities all my accounts were in acceptable. All I’m looking for some results on getting my account fixed so I can play again for as of now I cannot play the game interview developers release the Apple ID that has been used in their server so I can start a new. This is a great game. If you want to get ahead of the game quickly yes you do need to spend some money some of the packs a great some of the pantry very expensive. I applied to game without iron which takes a long time to get anywhere and I’m also spent on other matters. Or cities so all in all great game I think you could be cleaned up and have some of the minor issues fixed. I do believe the story line could be a little better I did notice though as the story goes all of a sudden it stops talking in the storyline changes so I think if you guys will create a better story line it would be great power and all all I would like to do is be able to play again. Period. Thanks the twisted one</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So I’ve played a lot of these kind of games, there fun to see how far you can get on your own. Now I play for free cause it is a free game and that normally doesn’t work out for me, I get sniper by a lvl 30 or a clan/guild runs me over for points for an event. For the longest time I thought these games are just ways companies make easy money. This game has really been a different story for me, the clan I joined actually talk to each other and want to become stronger, the developers send me tips and event messages daily, the whole game is fun again for me. Now it is a pay to win game I will say that, but if you have a job where you look at a machine run like me it’s a fun game to jump on and have fun, best part is I haven’t spent a dime and from doing everything with my clan and all the little quest the game throws at you I have obtain over 5k gold. So that is my honest review, not a bad game at all, gives to all kinds of people (free players, money dropping top rank players), something to enjoy at a normal work.</p>

Well this game gives you so much more then having to buy pack after pack. If you do the task you get some great rewards which helps free to play players. Sometimes I buy sometimes I don’t and yet I’m still managing to score within top 10 of the whole city where I’m at. \nThe only thing I have questions and concerns is the gold payouts on rewards for individual event or hell event should be a little more. Also in daily crime if you rank in top 50 you should be able to get more then 80 gold. Now that comes with buying packs for others to score top 3 where the gold payout is way better. Anyways been playing close to 2 years and don’t want to touch another game. Mafia city keep the great work up. Don’t let greed overtake such a good game for passing time. But do offer more gold for event wins and more speed ups. Also more events with gold tickets or coins to use for combine vouchers would be awesome too. Thank u all for developing a one bad to the bone game.","title":"Honest","userName":"kapple3188"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3029484794","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-08-07T08:36:41Z","rating":3,"review":"I would have to say this is been one of the greatest games I’ve played in a while. I have been playing since he 18 close to two years now. There are some issues that I’ve noticed and I’m late for major issues. I enjoyed the game so much I created many different accounts to keep me going for extra Parmesan everything else. But as of late every single account has now been on banded and I have no way to get into them and I have no way to start A new one. I do not remember what cities all my accounts were in acceptable. All I’m looking for some results on getting my account fixed so I can play again for as of now I cannot play the game interview developers release the Apple ID that has been used in their server so I can start a new. This is a great game. If you want to get ahead of the game quickly yes you do need to spend some money some of the packs a great some of the pantry very expensive. I applied to game without iron which takes a long time to get anywhere and I’m also spent on other matters. Or cities so all in all great game I think you could be cleaned up and have some of the minor issues fixed. I do believe the story line could be a little better I did notice though as the story goes all of a sudden it stops talking in the storyline changes so I think if you guys will create a better story line it would be great power and all all I would like to do is be able to play again.

This game has really been a different story for me, the clan I joined actually talk to each other and want to become stronger, the developers send me tips and event messages daily, the whole game is fun again for me. Now it is a pay to win game I will say that, but if you have a job where you look at a machine run like me it’s a fun game to jump on and have fun, best part is I haven’t spent a dime and from doing everything with my clan and all the little quest the game throws at you I have obtain over 5k gold. So that is my honest review, not a bad game at all, gives to all kinds of people (free players, money dropping top rank players), something to enjoy at a normal work.","title":"As honest as I can be","userName":"GrumpyWeedle"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4727264129","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-09-04T20:17:56Z","developerResponse":{"id":10454424,"body":"Hi boss, do you mind contact our LINE:@mafiacitycs, our LINE GM will help you with this issue very soon and thanks a lot for your supporting!

I like the story of this one and feel that it’s entertaining enough, however just like with all the other games, I build up what I can and then every day some other larger, bigger player comes and completely destroys what I’ve built. I have no resources or troops left and I’m just stuck rebuilding. You start to feel like a supplier for whichever jerk wants to completely decimate your game that night. It’s frustrating. I will likely stop playing soon because the truces are expensive and there’s no reason for them not to farm lower level players...there’s no penalty or consequence for effectively bullying new players. \n\nAlso, devs need to build in more options. I’m a straight female...this game is clearly directed at straight males. Would be great if this could be adjusted to adhere more to preferences.\n\nI’ve been away from the game for 2 days and in that time higher level players savagely destroyed my turf for the resources. I’m disappointed that this is allowed to happen. My turf has now been relocated so I can “rebuild in peace”. Forget it. I invested time and energy into this and because I step away for a weekend some mouth breathing jerks can completely destroy everything without penalty. I’m done. I’ve deleted the game.","title":"High level players bully lower levels for resources","userName":"jK 1120"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5366467090","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-01-06T02:28:44Z","developerResponse":{"id":12746281,"body":"Thank you for your support.

Like all MMO's it's pay to win but at least the dev team makes it interesting. In Mobile strike there are ridiculous amounts of troops sand speedup time that don't even make sense and can't be quantified on a normal scale. I love how that's not the case with mafia City there is a max lvl and you don't have to worry about spending 2000 to max and the dev team coming out the next day with something else for you to spend more money on. In this game the spending is gradually increased over time the higher lvls you achieve. I love the game the entertainment value from the people on the game at least in my experience, is worth every penny I've spent so far. I do wish more resources and speed ups were put in the 99 packs or they sold exclusive resources and speedups packs but other than that, it's good to go. Also troops are very expensive so it discourages fighting unless you can replace them😬 if you don't have at least 600 I would say don't download this game. Unless you don't care about being someone's target practice.","title":"MOBILE STRIKE ALTERNATIVE","userName":"Zay money"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4551560228","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-08-01T17:05:16Z","developerResponse":{"id":9979720,"body":"hi, thanks for leaving a comment.

From time to time I might buy a bundle to help me go on, but most times I avoided hem due to price and lack of good content that is worth purchasing. \n\nI don’t think it’s truly necessary to buy anything to enjoy this game and keep going. You earn so much without even trying! Here’s a lot of events that I honestly don’t even check out and then suddenly I have seven messages with rewards. Plus the daily rewards also give you a lot. But I do purchase a few bundles here and there because they’re really cheap and bring sooo much it’s crazy! \n\nSo far I’ve enjoyed this game a lot. It has fun and varied things to do and look out for. I totally suggest it for people who enjoy this sort of game and don’t want the pains of getting to a certain level and then going down the spiral of needing to purchase things to keep moving forward in a reasonable and fun pace.","title":"Best of this sort of game I’ve played!","userName":"elferain"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3807361926","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-02-24T03:04:34Z","rating":5,"review":"I have been playing for a while and I’ve noticed how helpful people are and how caring your clan members can be. Some things I wish could be added to the game (investing in two things at once) would be a nice touch. It’s a relatively fun game even though there is a limited number of things you can do. The game is pretty well made. But I think the prices in the shop should drop or you should get more for your money. This would be nice because if I’m going to spend a hundred dollars on a game I would hope I get some things like a babe rather than buy 3-4 packs and get one. Sorry but that’s $400 and unreasonable for a babe. Other than the prices I love the game. It’s very well built (bugs are common in games) it doesn’t fail or crash when a few thousand people are on a server which is amazing.

Do not think your playing some GTA mixed with Elder Scrolls style game. You have two screens, your home base and the larger map area (maybe some other options screens). The screenshots in the App Store are correct, however every single ad I have seen for this game has made it look like something completely different. This also is the EXACT same game as Guns of Glory and King of Avalon. There are probably more games that have been copied and pasted like this one. Minimal creativity and extremely disappointing. It is absolutely not alright to lead people on with completely misrepresented gameplay in ads linking to this terrible crap. Clearly the people falsifying the advertising know what people want to actually play....so why is the game not exactly like what the ads lead you to believe. The advertising campaign for these games is impressive, clearly people are falling for it, then settling for a subpar game. I am not. I am extremely disappointed and feel like I have been mislead by false ads making this game look much cooler than it really is. Don’t give these people money or your time.
