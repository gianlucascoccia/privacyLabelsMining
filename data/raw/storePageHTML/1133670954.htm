      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I started using Spark 4 years ago. It was exactly what I wanted and imagined - a simple video app that can help me document my travels. The simplicity of the interface makes a world of difference! You simply film along, a few seconds at a time, your trip, and in the end easily turn it into a music video that you can look back on. However, at the time the app was far from perfect. It didn’t have transitions so the video always cut off in an abrupt way. But what I love the most about this app is that the people behind it keep improving it over the years! I wrote to them and right away they wrote me back this nice email telling me about new functions they added to help me achieve a smoother fade-in and fade-out. I also told them my problems with sound transition. And literally the next update came with just the functions I needed. I can’t say it was my suggestion that prompted this, but I do know that they genuinely listen to their users’ feedback and are making the app better all the time! For that reason alone, Spark is so worth supporting because its makers genuinely care about how us users feel and they incorporate our feedback. Keep up the good work Team Spark! I now have over 80 videos of travel memories to look back on, I look forward to making many many many more ❤️</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Love this app. It’s absolutely phenomenal for what it’s intended purpose is. It isn’t a HARDCORE film editor, but you can certainly do quite a lot with it. It isn’t FilMic or anything like that, but it does give you a very impressive tools suite, a great app that doesn’t ever crash, a BEAUTIFUL UI...and it’s just intuitive. Swipes and Taps mostly to control most functions, which is natural to most people now. <br /><br />My only complaint — the subscription fee. Why not just let me BUY the app once, and you charge me an appropriate purchase price? I hate subscribing yearly or monthly to anything, and I struggle with that on this app. I wish they’d give you the option to permabuy, subscribe monthly, or do a yearly sub — some LIKE subscriptions vs the large cost of some apps, but honestly at this point....consumer choice is key. Give us some options, Devs! <br /><br />Otherwise AAA+++ with minimal gripes from me.</p>

</h3>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Really love the app. I use it every day as a way to record my own personal daily vlogs. But there are times when I’m exporting that when it completes the ring it doesn’t do anything. It just waits. So I usually have to force close reopen then try again. Usually it’ll work again but gets frustrating waiting twice. The other thing is after recording a fairly long single clip (&gt; 50 sec) there’s a bit of a delay before I can start recording again. Sometimes I immediately press to record but if it’s in the middle of that delay it doesn’t capture anything. So I end up wasting a shot. And the last issue I’d really love to have and been asking for a few years now is to have orientation lock. I shoot in landscape and because you don’t have a lock I need to keep my phone “orientation free” to accommodate Spark. It’s not a big deal most of the time except when I’m lying down on my side and everything rotates. So having a lock on the video orientation would be great. <br /><br />Otherwise great app!</p>

started using Spark 4 years ago. It was exactly what I wanted and imagined - a simple video app that can help me document my travels. The simplicity of the interface makes a world of difference! You simply film along, a few seconds at a time, your trip, and in the end easily turn it into a music video that you can look back on. However, at the time the app was far from perfect. It didn’t have transitions so the video always cut off in an abrupt way. But what I love the most about this app is that the people behind it keep improving it over the years! I wrote to them and right away they wrote me back this nice email telling me about new functions they added to help me achieve a smoother fade-in and fade-out. I also told them my problems with sound transition. And literally the next update came with just the functions I needed. I can’t say it was my suggestion that prompted this, but I do know that they genuinely listen to their users’ feedback and are making the app better all the time! For that reason alone, Spark is so worth supporting because its makers genuinely care about how us users feel and they incorporate our feedback. Keep up the good work Team Spark! I now have over 80 videos of travel memories to look back on, I look forward to making many many many more ❤️","title":"My Favorite App of All Time, My Memory Maker","userName":"ElanorMc"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7029882936","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-23T17:56:52Z","developerResponse":{"id":21475869,"body":"Thank you!

It isn’t a HARDCORE film editor, but you can certainly do quite a lot with it. It isn’t FilMic or anything like that, but it does give you a very impressive tools suite, a great app that doesn’t ever crash, a BEAUTIFUL UI...and it’s just intuitive. Swipes and Taps mostly to control most functions, which is natural to most people now. \n\nMy only complaint — the subscription fee. Why not just let me BUY the app once, and you charge me an appropriate purchase price? I hate subscribing yearly or monthly to anything, and I struggle with that on this app. I wish they’d give you the option to permabuy, subscribe monthly, or do a yearly sub — some LIKE subscriptions vs the large cost of some apps, but honestly at this point....consumer choice is key. Give us some options, Devs! \n\nOtherwise AAA+++ with minimal gripes from me.","title":"Exceptional App, Great Execution but, Subscription Yearly","userName":"Jared75684"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6000943856","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-05-27T15:03:57Z","developerResponse":{"id":11236256,"body":"Thank you so much for your feedback!

But there are times when I’m exporting that when it completes the ring it doesn’t do anything. It just waits. So I usually have to force close reopen then try again. Usually it’ll work again but gets frustrating waiting twice. The other thing is after recording a fairly long single clip (\u003e 50 sec) there’s a bit of a delay before I can start recording again. Sometimes I immediately press to record but if it’s in the middle of that delay it doesn’t capture anything. So I end up wasting a shot. And the last issue I’d really love to have and been asking for a few years now is to have orientation lock. I shoot in landscape and because you don’t have a lock I need to keep my phone “orientation free” to accommodate Spark. It’s not a big deal most of the time except when I’m lying down on my side and everything rotates. So having a lock on the video orientation would be great. \n\nOtherwise great app!","title":"Great app but some issues","userName":"jaybroho"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4121891380","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-05-09T04:10:19Z","rating":5,"review":"I have used this app for 5 years now, trying others as they came along. The rest got deleted, even the paid ones, but this one remains. It was not right away that I became comfortable with its minimalistic interface, but when I got used to it, it made sense and I actually like it now, because it is not loaded with options I never use. \nThe concept is this: you create a “spark”, which is just a smart way of grouping related video clips together and working with them, editing, rearranging, adding transitions, music, etc, until you are ready to produce a video with merged clips. You can have as many “sparks” as you want, and go between them any time you want. \nA pretty looking app and a smart way of keeping all of your themed clips in one place. \nThe customer service is superb too, responsive and polite.

I muted the videos and still here noise where clips are joined. After adding music it gets quieter also in between clips. \n\nIt turns out that my new iPhone has issues with playing videos across various apps, not just this app, so restarting my phone after turning the “auto play videos” back to ON in settings, and this app no longer blacks out clips and my photo roll no longer gets errors on videos. Weird that it worked. Thought my phone was going nuts, seems to be an iOS  issue. \n\nOriginal review. \nRecently, the app started blacking out clips, every other one while still retaining audio.  Could be because I offloaded the app and then reloaded?  Either way I am done with it, deleting today for good.  It was fun for a while to do quick edits, but it seems pricey to upgrade and has issues.  Couldn’t export videos today, I thought to see if it will export with the blackout parts, but now I am so annoyed I won’t even bother saving my videos and just will delete it all.  I use FinalCutpro for more demanding work but at times need quick on the go edits/tests.  Still looking for “the one”.   No 4K with the free version anymore, which is understandable, but there are other annoyances that keep pushing me away.  I was fascinated with this app some years back, but now it feels like maybe it needs a redesign, a lower price tag or maybe I’ve just outgrown it.","title":"Sound issue","userName":"Don'tWantToType"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6689788368","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-11-27T02:53:22Z","developerResponse":{"id":19438052,"body":"Hel­­­­­­­­lo There!
