      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I started watching because I am a fan of Bill O’Reilly and like him and everyone else I have watched so far. The issue I have is that often when a break comes, rather than getting whatever they put in for fill (opinion, good news, promos) gets bumped off and all these ads for shows on ABC come on. I have to close it all down and start over - aggravating!!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been watching The First’s live stream on Apple TV through Pluto, but wanted to see some of their other shows on demand, so I downloaded the app.  The app opens to the live broadcast, and these is a note at the bottom of the screen to press the menu button to return to the home section.  However, when I press either the menu or home buttons, the app closes.  When I press the menu button, the screen flashes before closing the app, which appears to be a crash.  I tried reloading the app and cycling the power on my Apple TV, but nothing changed.  So, I’m no better off with the app than I was watching on Pluto.<br />I still gave the app three stars because the mobile version works perfectly on my phone.  I like that the audio still plays while the phone is locked.</p>

(together with its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies, collectively, “TheFirstTV.com” or “we” or “our” or “us”). Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy is an integral part of the Terms and Conditions of Use and Service for this Website, and describes the types of information we may collect from you and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining and protecting such information, what we may do with it and how we intend to maintain and protect it, with whom we may share it or how we may disclose it, and how you can correct or change such information.\r\n\r\nThis Privacy Policy applies to information we collect:\r\n\r\non this Website, including webpages, interactive features and applications;\r\nin e-mail, text and other electronic messages between you and this Website;\r\nthrough mobile and desktop applications you may download from this Website, which provide dedicated non-browser-based interaction between you and this Website;\r\nwhen you interact with our advertising and applications on third-party websites and services, if those applications or advertising include links to this Privacy Policy.\r\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by:\r\nus offline (other than as provided in Section 1) or through any other means, including on any other website operated by The First or any third party;\r\nany third party, including through any application or content (such as advertising) that may link to or be accessible from this Website.\r\nIt is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it, especially before providing any personal data through this Website. This Website is operated in and controlled from the United States of America. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or Website, or if you wish to unsubscribe from Website services for which you have previously registered, please contact us at email@thefirsttv.com at the address at the end of this policy.\r\nPLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE TERMS OF SERVICE FOR THE WEBSITE CAREFULLY. YOUR USE OF THIS WEBSITE SIGNIFIES YOUR AGREEMENT TO SUCH PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF SERVICE.\r\nIf you do not agree with our policies and practices, your sole choice is not to use this Website.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\nTypes of Information Collected\r\nPersonal Data\r\nAggregate and Anonymous Data\r\nUse of Cookies and Other Technologies\r\nThird-Party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies\r\nOur Use of Your Information\r\nDisclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties\r\nDisclosure to Affiliates\r\nDisclosure to Third Parties\r\nDisclosure to Others\r\nInformation We Receive From Third Parties\r\nLinks to Other Websites\r\nYour Choices\r\nAccess and Correction\r\nChildren and Privacy\r\nMessage Boards, Chat Services, Blogs and Other User Forums\r\nYour California Privacy Right\r\nData Security\r\nExclusions\r\nOther Terms and Conditions\r\nWebsite Location\r\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nInterpretation\r\nContacting TheFirstTV.com Regarding Your Privacy\r\n1. Types of Information Collected.\r\nPersonal Data: Personally Identifiable Information (“Personal Data”) is any information that can be used to identify a specific individual, such as your name, email address, home address, phone number, demographic information (such as zip code, age), location information, or payment information (such as account or credit card information). This Website collects Personal Data when you interact with this Website, for example when you subscribe for newsletters; register for membership services such as chat services or message boards; participate in chat services, blogs, messaging services, bulletin boards, message boards or other user forums; respond to polls or surveys; purchase products or services via this Website; register for sweepstakes, contests and other promotional opportunities; or seek help from our customer service departments. We also may collect information when you purchase products or services offline, or register for wireless services via your cellphone or other wireless devices (collectively, “Other Services”). Because providing detailed information regarding our Privacy Policy when you register or provide information in connection with these Other Services often proves impractical, you may instead be provided with a short notice that reminds you to refer to this Privacy Policy and other relevant information from us. We may also obtain Personal Data from reputable third parties, such as credit agencies.\r\n\r\nAggregate and Anonymous Data: Aggregate and anonymous data is information that does not identify you specifically, including data collected automatically through the operation of this Website (“AA Data”). We may collect Website usage data (such as which Website pages you visit and in what sequence) through the use of various technologies. For example, we collect IP addresses from individuals who visit this Website. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that “serve up” Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from a website, its servers log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to any Personal Data, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to this Website and us. We may also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and connection information such as browser type or version. During some visits, we may use software tools, such as JavaScript, to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages, page interaction information, and methods used to browse away from the page.\r\n\r\n2. Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies.\r\nLike many websites, we use “cookies” or other similar technologies to collect AA Data. A cookie is a small data file that writes to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes when you visit this Website. Cookies allow this Website to measure traffic activity on this Website and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, allowing you to visit “member only” portions of this Website without re-registering, and tracking the progress and number of entries in activities that require registration or entry, such as sweepstakes.

This Website is operated in and controlled from the United States of America. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or Website, or if you wish to unsubscribe from Website services for which you have previously registered, please contact us at email@thefirsttv.com at the address at the end of this policy.\r\nPLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE TERMS OF SERVICE FOR THE WEBSITE CAREFULLY.

Types of Information Collected.\r\nPersonal Data: Personally Identifiable Information (“Personal Data”) is any information that can be used to identify a specific individual, such as your name, email address, home address, phone number, demographic information (such as zip code, age), location information, or payment information (such as account or credit card information). This Website collects Personal Data when you interact with this Website, for example when you subscribe for newsletters; register for membership services such as chat services or message boards; participate in chat services, blogs, messaging services, bulletin boards, message boards or other user forums; respond to polls or surveys; purchase products or services via this Website; register for sweepstakes, contests and other promotional opportunities; or seek help from our customer service departments. We also may collect information when you purchase products or services offline, or register for wireless services via your cellphone or other wireless devices (collectively, “Other Services”). Because providing detailed information regarding our Privacy Policy when you register or provide information in connection with these Other Services often proves impractical, you may instead be provided with a short notice that reminds you to refer to this Privacy Policy and other relevant information from us. We may also obtain Personal Data from reputable third parties, such as credit agencies.\r\n\r\nAggregate and Anonymous Data: Aggregate and anonymous data is information that does not identify you specifically, including data collected automatically through the operation of this Website (“AA Data”). We may collect Website usage data (such as which Website pages you visit and in what sequence) through the use of various technologies. For example, we collect IP addresses from individuals who visit this Website. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that “serve up” Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from a website, its servers log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to any Personal Data, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to this Website and us. We may also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and connection information such as browser type or version. During some visits, we may use software tools, such as JavaScript, to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages, page interaction information, and methods used to browse away from the page.\r\n\r\n2. Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies.\r\nLike many websites, we use “cookies” or other similar technologies to collect AA Data. A cookie is a small data file that writes to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes when you visit this Website. Cookies allow this Website to measure traffic activity on this Website and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, allowing you to visit “member only” portions of this Website without re-registering, and tracking the progress and number of entries in activities that require registration or entry, such as sweepstakes. Similarly, if you have asked us to send you information about upcoming products and promotions, using cookies we collect information about which Website pages you have visited and in what order (“Clickstream Data”) that may allow us to narrow or limit the materials provided to you based on your prior online activities or preferences. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent, as described below.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we may use a service that collects data remotely by using so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”) embedded in the Website’s content. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1×1), that is ordinarily not visible to Website visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. This information is AA Data.\r\n\r\nTo learn how you may be able to reduce the number of cookies you receive from us, or delete cookies that have already been installed in your browser’s cookie folder, please refer to your browser’s help menu or other instructions related to your browser. If you do disable or opt out of receiving cookies, we will honor your request, however please be aware that some content, functionality, services and features on this Website may not be available or work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your TheFirstTV.com account. In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.\r\n\r\nYou can also learn more about cookies by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org, which includes additional, useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browsers.\r\n\r\nThird-Party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: Some content, functionality, services or features, including advertisements, on or available through this Website are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, licensors, service providers, content providers and application providers. These third parties may use cookies, alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies, to collect information about you when you use this Website. The information they collect may be associated with your Personal Data or they may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.\r\n\r\nWe do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.\r\n\r\n3. Our Use of Your Data.\r\nWe use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any Personal Data:\r\nTo present our Website and its contents to you.\r\nTo provide you with information, products or services that you request from us.\r\nTo fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it.\r\nTo provide you with notices about your account or subscription, including expiration and renewal notices.\r\nTo carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection.\r\nTo notify you about changes to our Website or any products or services we offer or provide through it.\r\nTo allow you to participate in interactive features on our Website.\r\nIn any other way we may describe when you provide the information.\r\nFor any other purpose with your consent.\r\nWe may also use your information to contact you about our own and third-parties’ products and services that may be of interest to you.

For example, if you provide Personal Data to register for a newsletter or a text messaging service, to enter a contest or a sweepstake, or to purchase goods or services, we will use it to register you for or provide you with those goods or services.

We also may send information or offers to selected groups of Website users on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give those businesses your name or address. Under certain circumstances (for example, if you win a contest) we may post your Personal Data on this Website. We will notify you of this possibility when you provide the Personal Data and, if possible, when the Personal Data is posted.\r\n\r\nCookies and similar tools may be used to relate your use of this Website and AA Data to Personal Data obtained from you. If any AA Data is linked with Personal Data, the linked AA Data will then be treated as Personal Data.\r\n\r\nAA Data: We may also use Personal Data in aggregate form for purposes of research or analysis. In order to better understand and serve the users of this Website and Other Services, TheFirstTV.com often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data we gather.

For example, IP addresses are used for the purposes of system administration and to provide AA Data to advertisers about the volume of use on this Website, and Clickstream Data and demographic AA Data may be shared with our advertisers and other business partners. We may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess technology that allows this Website to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on this Website. This data (including Clickstream Data about your activities on our Website) may be shared with these companies for this purpose.\r\n\r\n4. Disclosure of Personal Data: Disclosure to Affiliates.\r\nWe may disclose aggregated information about our users, and other information that does not identify any individual, without restriction.\r\nWe may disclose Personal Data that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy:\r\n\r\nTo contractors, content providers, product providers, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business [and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep Personal Data confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them].\r\nTo fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. [For example, if you give us an e-mail address to use the “e-mail a friend” feature of our Website, we will transmit the contents of that e-mail and your e-mail address to the recipients.]\r\nFor any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.\r\nOtherwise, with your consent.\r\nWe reserve the right to share Personal Data with our affiliates. If you do not want us to share your Personal Data with our affiliated companies for their marketing purposes, you may opt-out of such sharing by contacting us at email@thefirsttv.com (see “Your Choices” below).\r\n\r\nDisclosure to Third Parties: TheFirstTV.com, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions on our behalf, such as hosting this Website or specific portions of this Website, maintaining databases, administering contests, providing wireless services, mailing information and processing payments. When we employ a third party to perform these functions, that third party will only be provided with the particular Personal Data it needs to perform its function, and is required to protect the Personal Data. For third-party sponsored sweepstakes, contests or promotions, we may request Personal Data from you that may be shared with the sponsor upon request.\r\n\r\nDisclosure to Others:\r\n\r\nIn addition, we may disclose Personal Data without providing you with a choice under the following limited circumstances to: (1) protect the legal rights, property, privacy or safety of TheFirstTV.com or its directors, officers, employees, agents and contractors; (2) protect the legal rights, property, safety and security of visitors to our Website or other properties and the public; (3) protect against fraud, security issues, technical issues or illegal activity or for risk management purposes; (4) respond to inquiries or requests from public authorities, such as law enforcement authorities; (5) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; (6) enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; (7) respond to an emergency; or (8) comply with any court order, law, rule, regulation, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.\r\n\r\nIf TheFirstTV.com sells all or part of this Website or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, we may, in our sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign your Personal Data to a third party as part of or in connection with that transaction. Upon such transfer, the privacy policy of the acquiring entity may govern the further use of your Personal Data.\r\n\r\n5. Information we receive from third parties.\r\nWe may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from TheFirstTV.com, that website will submit to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested.

We may supplement the information we collect about you through this Website with such information from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you or to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.\r\n\r\n6.
