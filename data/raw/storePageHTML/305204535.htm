      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Kayak has been a fantastic company to use for anything travel! &amp; has continued to impress me with their fun and very easy to use features. Airline companies often set standard pricing for their flights and the caveat that the normal person is looking for it matching all these flights with their specific needs i.e. layover timeline, # of bags, airline make/model, &amp; flight times. A ‘Good Deal’ is a very generalized term and many other apps use that as their main means of persuasion when in fact it’s clear that sites like Kayak are so good at categorizing exactly what meets your needs and alining airliners to your schedule, like advertised they have a multitude of tools like bag number and layover timeline settings with a accurate representation of what the cost will be regardless if it is two separate companies. If you choose a flight selection that has a 2 hour layover for one airliner and you select ‘book’ the airliners website which it directs you to within the app has that selection already selected. I could go on and on about how easy and secure this app is to use so please give it a try.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I got this app for one plane flight, simple as that. I was planning on deleting it right after because I thought I had no use for it. But then I started to realize that any trips I was planning on taking would show up on this app and would be organized by time and date (because I connected my email).<br /> I’m planning on taking an Amtrak to the airport and then back again &amp; accidentally chose the wrong date for the train back, and because Kayak organizes the trips so well, I was able to catch that but if not for this app, that would have been $20 down the bin &amp; a missed class. <br /><br />I honestly love this app because there are no annoying adds that pop up when I’m trying to figure my plans out &amp; it helps me organize everything so well. It also works offline when I’m looking at my already planned trips which will help out a lot when I’m abroad. <br />I don’t use the search tool within the app for hotels cars or flights, but they have that option as well.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I&#39;ve been using Kayak to book my flights for about 2 years now. I like them. Only thing that would make it better was if you could filter what types of flights you wanted for alert emails. I have two kids I&#39;m flighting with this time and even though my last two flights basic economy was a great option because I&#39;m not particular about where I sit, this time around I need to ensure my boys are beside me. I get really excited to see a price in a email just to see it&#39;s basic economy and the regular economy tickets are like $40 more. $40 difference is a lot when you need 3 of them. Another great improvement would be being able to mix and match the flight there and the flight back. Since we&#39;re going to New York to visit my fiancé I want a really early flight to get there and a late afternoon to come back. Sometimes they add up like that but usually they don&#39;t. I could book them separate but it would be a lot easier if they could just be chosen like that. Those are my only complaints. Still like and will use the site.</p>

\nEffective as of December 17, 2015\n\nThis policy describes KAYAK’s practices regarding personally identifiable information and data (“personal information”). This policy applies to our websites, mobile applications, email and text messages, and social media accounts (the “Platforms”). When you use the Platforms, you agree to the terms in this policy.\n\nThe categories of Personal Information we collect\nWhen you visit the Platforms, we may collect information from you. Some of it may be personal information. This information can include search history, IP address, screen resolution, browser used, operating system and settings, access times and referring URL. If you are using a mobile device, we may also collect data that identifies your device, your settings and your location.\n\nIf you book a travel product via the Platforms, we may need additional information from you. This information can include your name (and traveler’s name if different), passport number, email address, telephone number, credit card information, billing address, itinerary and frequent flyer details. You can also choose to store personal information in your user account for future bookings.\n\nIf you choose to register, we will collect your email address, password and home airport, and other preference information you provide us. If you choose a third-party service, like Facebook Login, to register or login, you are permitting us to use and store that information related to the account.\n\nIf you make a booking on Kayak we will automatically create a “Trips” account for you and you will have access to our “Trips” service, where we will collect your travel information to create and maintain your travel itineraries. This can include the personal information that may be included in the confirmation emails you forward to us.\n\nWhen you give us personal information, you are telling us that the information is true, accurate, complete and current. You are also telling us that you have the authorization to provide it to us.\n\nHow we collect your Personal Information\nWe collect your personal information directly from you. For example, when you provide us your personal information when you register or book travel.\n\nWe also collect your personal information passively. For example, we collect information about you over time and across different Web sites when you visit this Platform. We also use tracking tools like cookies and beacons. To learn more about these tools and how to control them, visit http://www.kayak.com/privacy\n\nWe collect your personal information from third parties. This can include when you log in using a third party platform, such as Facebook.\n\nPlatform features may make use of your device attributes and settings that will allow us to determine your physical location. Such technologies may include IP address mapping, WiFi, GPS signals, cell tower positioning or other technologies. We use this information to enhance and personalize your experience and provide you with offers and services that may be of interest to you. For example, we may help you find your closest hotel or send you messages that may be of interest to you based on your current location. Kayak does not have control over your device settings, but we do recommend enabling location services on your device so you can take advantage of the location based features and functionality offered.\n\nWhy we use your Personal Information\nTo provide you and improve our Platforms and services, to better understand the users of our Platforms and services, to protect our property and to prevent damage to them.\n\nTo process your bookings and store your itinerary information where applicable.\n\nTo display more relevant advertising and recommendations, or suppress advertising and content that you might find irrelevant.\n\nTo contact you, including as follows:\n» To send booking confirmations;\n» To send alerts and notifications you have subscribed to, including to your mobile device;\n» To solicit reviews;\n» When you send booking confirmations to our Trips service;\n» To get in touch if you contact KAYAK customer service;\n» To send you information servicing and administrative emails;\n» To send you marketing emails from a KAYAK address regarding our services or those of our partners, if you have opted-in to receive emails from us or have transacted with us, and as permitted by law.\n\nYour Choices\nYou can manage your communication preferences in your account at https://www.kayak.com/account. Marketing email has an opt-out URL and you can unsubscribe from such communication at any time. You cannot unsubscribe from servicing emails and administrative messages that are considered part of your account membership, unless you cancel your membership.\n\nHow we share your Personal Information\nWe may share your personal information with our corporate affiliates and with third parties for our legitimate business purposes as permitted by law. For example, we may share your personal information with suppliers who perform services on our behalf and have agreed in writing to protect and not further disclose your information.\n\nIf you book through the Platforms, we may share your personal information with the payment service providers and the travel vendors you have booked with. This can include online travel agencies, hotels, airlines, car rental companies, and travel insurance providers. These third parties will process your personal information as data controllers in accordance with their own privacy policies.\n\nWe may also share your information as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. For example, if you provide information to enter a sweepstakes, we may share your information with the promotional partners.\n\nIf KAYAK itself (or part of its business) is sold or otherwise changes control, owners would have access to your personal information for the uses set out herein.\n\nIf you use or have itineraries as part of our Trips Service, you can send or grant access to your itinerary to anyone you choose. Your itinerary may contain enough details (for example, booking reference codes) to allow the recipient to cancel or modify your booking, perform a check-in, etc. You should only share your itinerary with people you trust. Please also read the detailed Trips FAQ. If you choose to display your itinerary on publicly-viewable web pages (Facebook, for instance), that information may be collected and used by others.\n\nIf you provide us a review of your trip, you authorize us to publish it on all our Platforms under the screen name you provided. You also authorize us to aggregate it with other reviews.\n\nWe may disclose personal information if required by law, for example to law enforcement or other authorities. This includes court orders, subpoenas and orders arising from legal processes, and administrative or criminal investigations. We may also disclose your personal information if the disclosure is necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts or to prevent other damage, or in response to a legal action or to enforce our rights and claims.\n\nWe may also share anonymous aggregated usage information with others.\n\nHow we store and protect your Personal Information\nOur servers and data centers are located in the U.S and in Switzerland, and our service providers may be located there and in other countries. By providing us personal information, you agree that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in these countries. These countries may have different and/or less stringent privacy/data protection and data security rules than those of your own country. As a result, your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those countries according to laws in those countries. Subject to the applicable laws in such other countries, we will provide the necessary safeguards to maintain protections of your personal information, e.g. by obtaining from the data recipients contractual commitments based on the EU model clauses.\n\nKAYAK has a security program intended to keep the personal information stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access and misuse. Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to industry standards. We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the data you send over the Internet. Personal information may only be accessed by persons within our organizations, or our third parties to carry out the uses indicated in this Privacy Policy.\n\nCookies and tracking tools\nKAYAK uses cookies and tracking tools.

If we become aware that a minor is attempting to submit personal information, we will remove this information from our records. If you are the parent/legal guardian of a minor who has given us personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.\n\nChanges to the Privacy Policy\nWe may modify this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice. We will notify you of material changes to how we use your personal information prior to implementing them. We may notify you about such a material change by email or prominent notice on our website.

However, in exceptional cases we ask you to pay reasonable fee before we provide the information if permitted by applicable law. We may request proof of your identity before providing this information. We may not be able to allow you to access certain personal information in some cases. For example if your personal information is connected with personal information of other persons, or for legal reasons. In such cases we will provide you with an explanation why you cannot obtain this information. You can also withdraw your consent to the use of your personal information at any time by contacting us at the address below. You can demand deletion or rectification of your personal information, however, statutory provisions, especially those affecting KAYAK’s accounting, processing of claims, and mandatory data retention, may prohibit deletion or anonymization.\n\nTo exercise your rights, or if you have questions about our privacy practices or need assistance with exercising or understanding your privacy choices, please contact our Privacy Officer at privacy-officer@kayak.com or you may write to:\nKAYAK\n\u2028Attention: Privacy Officer\n\u20287 Market Street\n\u2028Stamford, CT 06902, USA.\n \nCookies and other tracking tools\n\nKAYAK uses tracking tools such as cookies\nWe (or our suppliers) use several common tracking tools.

How to do this varies from browser to browser. You should view the Help menu on the browser you use for further information.\nTo opt out of having your online behavior tracked for advertising purposes visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.\n\nWe may also use Google Analytics to collect demographic and interest data about you (such as age, gender, and interests), including through Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.

These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.\nIf you have any questions on our use of tracking tools, please use the feedback form: https://www.kayak.com/k/feedback/form","editorialNotes":{"short":"Find the best dates to travel and get alerts on great deals.","tagline":"Plan your travels "},"is32bitOnly":false,"isStandaloneWithCompanionForWatchOS":false,"seller":"Kayak Software Corp","isSiriSupported":false,"languageList":["English","Danish","Dutch","Finnish","French","German","Greek","Indonesian","Italian","Japanese","Korean","Norwegian Bokmål","Polish","Portuguese","Russian","Simplified Chinese","Spanish","Swedish","Thai","Traditional Chinese","Turkish"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"description":{"standard":"KAYAK searches hundreds of travel sites at once so you don’t have to.

This policy applies to our websites, mobile applications, email and text messages, and social media accounts (the “Platforms”). When you use the Platforms, you agree to the terms in this policy.\n\nThe categories of Personal Information we collect\nWhen you visit the Platforms, we may collect information from you. Some of it may be personal information. This information can include search history, IP address, screen resolution, browser used, operating system and settings, access times and referring URL. If you are using a mobile device, we may also collect data that identifies your device, your settings and your location.\n\nIf you book a travel product via the Platforms, we may need additional information from you. This information can include your name (and traveler’s name if different), passport number, email address, telephone number, credit card information, billing address, itinerary and frequent flyer details. You can also choose to store personal information in your user account for future bookings.\n\nIf you choose to register, we will collect your email address, password and home airport, and other preference information you provide us. If you choose a third-party service, like Facebook Login, to register or login, you are permitting us to use and store that information related to the account.\n\nIf you make a booking on Kayak we will automatically create a “Trips” account for you and you will have access to our “Trips” service, where we will collect your travel information to create and maintain your travel itineraries. This can include the personal information that may be included in the confirmation emails you forward to us.\n\nWhen you give us personal information, you are telling us that the information is true, accurate, complete and current. You are also telling us that you have the authorization to provide it to us.\n\nHow we collect your Personal Information\nWe collect your personal information directly from you. For example, when you provide us your personal information when you register or book travel.\n\nWe also collect your personal information passively. For example, we collect information about you over time and across different Web sites when you visit this Platform. We also use tracking tools like cookies and beacons. To learn more about these tools and how to control them, visit http://www.kayak.com/privacy\n\nWe collect your personal information from third parties. This can include when you log in using a third party platform, such as Facebook.\n\nPlatform features may make use of your device attributes and settings that will allow us to determine your physical location. Such technologies may include IP address mapping, WiFi, GPS signals, cell tower positioning or other technologies. We use this information to enhance and personalize your experience and provide you with offers and services that may be of interest to you. For example, we may help you find your closest hotel or send you messages that may be of interest to you based on your current location. Kayak does not have control over your device settings, but we do recommend enabling location services on your device so you can take advantage of the location based features and functionality offered.\n\nWhy we use your Personal Information\nTo provide you and improve our Platforms and services, to better understand the users of our Platforms and services, to protect our property and to prevent damage to them.\n\nTo process your bookings and store your itinerary information where applicable.\n\nTo display more relevant advertising and recommendations, or suppress advertising and content that you might find irrelevant.\n\nTo contact you, including as follows:\n» To send booking confirmations;\n» To send alerts and notifications you have subscribed to, including to your mobile device;\n» To solicit reviews;\n» When you send booking confirmations to our Trips service;\n» To get in touch if you contact KAYAK customer service;\n» To send you information servicing and administrative emails;\n» To send you marketing emails from a KAYAK address regarding our services or those of our partners, if you have opted-in to receive emails from us or have transacted with us, and as permitted by law.\n\nYour Choices\nYou can manage your communication preferences in your account at https://www.kayak.com/account. Marketing email has an opt-out URL and you can unsubscribe from such communication at any time. You cannot unsubscribe from servicing emails and administrative messages that are considered part of your account membership, unless you cancel your membership.\n\nHow we share your Personal Information\nWe may share your personal information with our corporate affiliates and with third parties for our legitimate business purposes as permitted by law. For example, we may share your personal information with suppliers who perform services on our behalf and have agreed in writing to protect and not further disclose your information.\n\nIf you book through the Platforms, we may share your personal information with the payment service providers and the travel vendors you have booked with. This can include online travel agencies, hotels, airlines, car rental companies, and travel insurance providers. These third parties will process your personal information as data controllers in accordance with their own privacy policies.\n\nWe may also share your information as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. For example, if you provide information to enter a sweepstakes, we may share your information with the promotional partners.\n\nIf KAYAK itself (or part of its business) is sold or otherwise changes control, owners would have access to your personal information for the uses set out herein.\n\nIf you use or have itineraries as part of our Trips Service, you can send or grant access to your itinerary to anyone you choose. Your itinerary may contain enough details (for example, booking reference codes) to allow the recipient to cancel or modify your booking, perform a check-in, etc. You should only share your itinerary with people you trust. Please also read the detailed Trips FAQ. If you choose to display your itinerary on publicly-viewable web pages (Facebook, for instance), that information may be collected and used by others.\n\nIf you provide us a review of your trip, you authorize us to publish it on all our Platforms under the screen name you provided. You also authorize us to aggregate it with other reviews.\n\nWe may disclose personal information if required by law, for example to law enforcement or other authorities. This includes court orders, subpoenas and orders arising from legal processes, and administrative or criminal investigations. We may also disclose your personal information if the disclosure is necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts or to prevent other damage, or in response to a legal action or to enforce our rights and claims.\n\nWe may also share anonymous aggregated usage information with others.\n\nHow we store and protect your Personal Information\nOur servers and data centers are located in the U.S and in Switzerland, and our service providers may be located there and in other countries. By providing us personal information, you agree that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in these countries. These countries may have different and/or less stringent privacy/data protection and data security rules than those of your own country. As a result, your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those countries according to laws in those countries. Subject to the applicable laws in such other countries, we will provide the necessary safeguards to maintain protections of your personal information, e.g. by obtaining from the data recipients contractual commitments based on the EU model clauses.\n\nKAYAK has a security program intended to keep the personal information stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access and misuse. Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to industry standards. We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the data you send over the Internet. Personal information may only be accessed by persons within our organizations, or our third parties to carry out the uses indicated in this Privacy Policy.\n\nCookies and tracking tools\nKAYAK uses cookies and tracking tools. To learn more, including how we respond to “Do not track” signals visit http://www.kayak.com/privacy\n\nOther Websites\nIf you click through to third party websites or other platforms, KAYAK’s privacy policy does not apply.\n\nChildren\nKAYAK does not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If we become aware that a minor is attempting to submit personal information, we will remove this information from our records.

Airline companies often set standard pricing for their flights and the caveat that the normal person is looking for it matching all these flights with their specific needs i.e. layover timeline, # of bags, airline make/model, \u0026 flight times. A ‘Good Deal’ is a very generalized term and many other apps use that as their main means of persuasion when in fact it’s clear that sites like Kayak are so good at categorizing exactly what meets your needs and alining airliners to your schedule, like advertised they have a multitude of tools like bag number and layover timeline settings with a accurate representation of what the cost will be regardless if it is two separate companies. If you choose a flight selection that has a 2 hour layover for one airliner and you select ‘book’ the airliners website which it directs you to within the app has that selection already selected. I could go on and on about how easy and secure this app is to use so please give it a try.","title":"A joy to use","userName":"RedXIII_"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3843521462","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-03-05T01:19:22Z","rating":5,"review":"I got this app for one plane flight, simple as that. I was planning on deleting it right after because I thought I had no use for it.

I like them. Only thing that would make it better was if you could filter what types of flights you wanted for alert emails. I have two kids I'm flighting with this time and even though my last two flights basic economy was a great option because I'm not particular about where I sit, this time around I need to ensure my boys are beside me. I get really excited to see a price in a email just to see it's basic economy and the regular economy tickets are like $40 more. $40 difference is a lot when you need 3 of them. Another great improvement would be being able to mix and match the flight there and the flight back. Since we're going to New York to visit my fiancé I want a really early flight to get there and a late afternoon to come back. Sometimes they add up like that but usually they don't. I could book them separate but it would be a lot easier if they could just be chosen like that. Those are my only complaints.

It is beautifully designed and works amazing. I only have one problem with it. It won’t let you search for a “youth’s” flight with no adult. Anyone above 12 is allowed to fly by themselves.  They have a “youth” listed as a person between 12-17, whereas a “child” is 2-11. It would seem that they have this separated for the purpose of allowing someone to look at prices for just a youth; However, even when the youth ticket is added, when you try and delete the adult ticket selected on default, it will tell you that there must be one adult traveling. This makes it harder for me because different airlines charge different fees for unaccompanied minors, especially the ones that charge for the unaccompanied minor service no matter their age. As I am trying to book a flight for 2 teenagers, this is necessary for me. Disregarding that, the app is the most user friendly and easy to use booking apps I’ve seen.","title":"Great except for one thing","userName":"Maddie1975"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2459396524","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-04-23T19:55:23Z","rating":1,"review":"I have used kayak for a long time but recently had a very terrible experience and will not be booking flights through kayak anymore. Beware of the “trips” portion of the app. I bought a flight through kayak and it was added to my trips. There were changes to my flight, but my trips still reflected the original times, even though I used kayak to purchase my flights. Long story short I ended up missing my flight and paying lots of money in change fees. It’s odd to me that the company automatically lists the flight you purchased through their company under “trips” but do not update the flight information if an airline changes flight times. Even when I missed my actual flight my app still said “4 hours 27 minutes until take off”. Super unfortunate end to a trip, but learned my lesson to never book with kayak again. Also, when trying to sort and talk through this issue, I was unable to speak with anyone from kayak.

Sometimes it recommends to wait as the prices will drop and sometimes does not show up at all. Then you want to follow it, but even the next day it does not tell anything, it makes it confusing to decide on waiting or buying the ticket at that time or still continue waiting as was suggested a day before. You buy the ticket due to uncertainty of the idea that in fact prices are still going up in those two days then after a week it starts showing up to wait again as the prices will drop.
