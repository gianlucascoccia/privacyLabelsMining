      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I own a mobile business with multiple appointments every day.  I have been using Week Calendar for over five years and I found it significantly more useful and easier to work with them the built-in Apple calendar.  I use iTunes to synchronize my phone calendars with my pc’s Outlook calendar and Week Calendar functions perfectly. <br /><br />The Week Calendar’s additional weekly and mini-month views are exceptionally useful for seeing an overview of scheduled appointments.  Andy interface is easy to use. The search function is great for helping to find previous appointments but unfortunately, the newest version of the app continually reverts back to a 1-year search envelope after every search.  It can be adjusted using the gear tool for a longer search envelope but setting the beginning date automatically moves the end date to one year later requiring the user to modify both dates each time they need a longer search. The older version of the app retained the previously used search dates after each search. I hope this option is re-incorporated into the next update.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this app for anyone who needs more control of their phone calendar than the built-in iPhone calendar provides<br />.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>When I first write this, I had been using this app for almost a year. Now I’ve used it for many years and still really really love it. “The mini month is SO useful to me. It&#39;s just about like the month view in google calendar on a full computer. I can see all my events in one view. There&#39;s little great features too - if you have too many things to see in the mini month line (mon-sun), you can scroll down in the line without switching views. Likewise if the event has lots of details, you can scroll the window that pops up when you tap on it. You can even edit a lot of the event without needing to go to the edit window. This calendar is worlds more useful to me than the stock calendar. Oh, and I was testing CalenMob and this one seems to have more features and runs much quicker than CalenMob. There are tons of features, many of which I don&#39;t use, and he option to use them or not. Options are lovely. The only thing I&#39;d say could use improvement is that the notifications from weekcal are linked to the stock calendar and will take you there rather than weekcal if you tap on them. This hasn&#39;t been much of an issue for me as I just notice that I have an event reminder and then go straight to weekcal. Price when I got it was only $2 too. Thank you!”</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>As stated in the title, I love this app. I&#39;ve been using it for maybe 5-6 years, shortly after I got my first iPhone (my phone before that was a Palm Centro, which had a GREAT  calendar). Weekly Calendar has everything I need plus more, and they are always improving it. My favorite parts are being able to assign certain types of events a specific color (such as errands being purple, appointments being bright pink, etc.) as well as auto-color, in which I assign specific to a specific name or title (such as events pertaining to my daughter). I&#39;m a visual person and need events to stand out from each other; otherwise, everything blends in together when I’m looking for something specific.  I also have Week Calendar on my iPad.<br /><br />However, in the past week, and only on my iPhone, I have lost the ability to keep new colors that I have created as well as use auto-colors for specific events. I’ve done everything I know of, including deleting the app, but I’m just not able to create and keep colors as well as assign colors to specific events, even colors that I don’t create, colors that come with the app. It’s frustrating.</p>

I have been using Week Calendar for over five years and I found it significantly more useful and easier to work with them the built-in Apple calendar.  I use iTunes to synchronize my phone calendars with my pc’s Outlook calendar and Week Calendar functions perfectly. \n\nThe Week Calendar’s additional weekly and mini-month views are exceptionally useful for seeing an overview of scheduled appointments.  Andy interface is easy to use. The search function is great for helping to find previous appointments but unfortunately, the newest version of the app continually reverts back to a 1-year search envelope after every search.  It can be adjusted using the gear tool for a longer search envelope but setting the beginning date automatically moves the end date to one year later requiring the user to modify both dates each time they need a longer search. The older version of the app retained the previously used search dates after each search. I hope this option is re-incorporated into the next update.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this app for anyone who needs more control of their phone calendar than the built-in iPhone calendar provides\n.","title":"Great app, but some minor limitations","userName":"Itsmicroman"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6081964845","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-16T08:12:26Z","developerResponse":{"id":16024415,"body":"Thank you for taking the time to share this feedback!

Now I’ve used it for many years and still really really love it. “The mini month is SO useful to me. It's just about like the month view in google calendar on a full computer. I can see all my events in one view. There's little great features too - if you have too many things to see in the mini month line (mon-sun), you can scroll down in the line without switching views. Likewise if the event has lots of details, you can scroll the window that pops up when you tap on it. You can even edit a lot of the event without needing to go to the edit window. This calendar is worlds more useful to me than the stock calendar. Oh, and I was testing CalenMob and this one seems to have more features and runs much quicker than CalenMob. There are tons of features, many of which I don't use, and he option to use them or not. Options are lovely. The only thing I'd say could use improvement is that the notifications from weekcal are linked to the stock calendar and will take you there rather than weekcal if you tap on them. This hasn't been much of an issue for me as I just notice that I have an event reminder and then go straight to weekcal. Price when I got it was only $2 too.

Weekly Calendar has everything I need plus more, and they are always improving it. My favorite parts are being able to assign certain types of events a specific color (such as errands being purple, appointments being bright pink, etc.) as well as auto-color, in which I assign specific to a specific name or title (such as events pertaining to my daughter). I'm a visual person and need events to stand out from each other; otherwise, everything blends in together when I’m looking for something specific.  I also have Week Calendar on my iPad.\n\nHowever, in the past week, and only on my iPhone, I have lost the ability to keep new colors that I have created as well as use auto-colors for specific events. I’ve done everything I know of, including deleting the app, but I’m just not able to create and keep colors as well as assign colors to specific events, even colors that I don’t create, colors that come with the app. It’s frustrating.","title":"I Love This App, But...","userName":"Faeriegrl1"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3880043098","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-03-14T11:40:15Z","developerResponse":{"id":9790464,"body":"We are sorry to see hear you are having problems with the app. The performance of the app is a priority for us and something we will continue to optimize.

So when you get a notification, it’s from the Apple Calendar app; tapping on the notification takes you to the Apple Calendar app, not Week Calendar. If you don’t have the native iOS Calendar app installed, tapping on the notification takes you to the App Store to install the native iOS calendar app!\n\nFor a paid app, with a subscription plan (a subscription plan that, by the way, removed a few features that were in the paid app and now makes those available only if you subscribe and pay monthly) not having app specific notifications, etc. is ridiculous. Week Calendar explains the reason behind using the native iOS calendar for notifications on their site, but I call b.s.! This is just lazy programming! There are myriad calendar apps that all have their own app specific notifications. I’ve tried dozens of calendar apps and all the notifications worked fine; I didn’t miss any notifications, as suggested in Week Calendar’s explanation. \n\nTheir support is weak. I emailed them for support...no response. So they want to take $8 a month from me, but don’t offer support and lack some important features? I don’t think so. They should change the name of this app to Weak Calendar!","title":"Need Apple Cal for full functionality?!","userName":"RDub76"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4828802308","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-09-23T15:30:42Z","rating":5,"review":"WeekCal has some features that makes it much more useful than the native iOS calendar. First and foremost: the ability to quickly and easily place an entry onto multiple calendars. That makes it *perfect* for managing multiple calendars among multiple individuals. And having the calendar based on the native app is actually a HUGE benefit (despite other reviewers complaining about it). With the calendar information residing in the native iOS function, I can share calendars with others and they don’t have to have WeekCal installed on their device to receive appointments I’ve entered. They get all the changes, updates, deletions, and adjustments I make in WeekCal right in their native iOS calendars. How great is that?  Please, please, please don’t take that away. I would actually remove WeekCal if it didn’t work that way. Finally: I don’t want all of the “features” in the Pro version, so I’m not going to buy it. I’m actually happy to pay a little more for the regular version because it’s a great app and the developers deserve to make some money for what they’ve created and support. But please quit bugging me about the Pro version.","title":"Perfect as is","userName":"LSSR22"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6459461628","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-23T11:10:12Z","rating":5,"review":"Updated 2020 Sep 23rd: Okay. Version 13.2.2 restores previously paid-upfront functionality. I like the app and I like this version of the app but, still, communication here is disappointing. No details in release notes. No response to my numerous support requests. The app itself is good and so I hope, from here on, developers manage to win back users' trust. Right now I for one am open-minded but wary.\n\nUpdated 2020 Sep 20th: Version 13.2.0 has bugs with entitlements, takes away functionality that I paid for (back when the app sold on paid-upfront basis). I still am waiting to hear back from developers, let alone for developers to issue a fix. DO NOT UPDATE.\n\nOld review: WeekCalendar a great app gone bad, marred by feature creep and by downright sketchy privacy policy. Updates are scant and so subscription-only pricing is questionable. Despite there having been just one substantive update in the past ten months, the price for annual subscription (which covers iPhone only) climbs seventy-three percent -- ridiculous! For me this app a 'goodbye' not a good buy.","title":"Version 13.2.2 does restore functionality","userName":"Wooooooooooooooo0"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5055682105","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-10-31T13:19:41Z","rating":5,"review":"So, I’ve been a WeekCalendar user for a LONG time. I bought the app way back when it was $1.99 or $2.99 or something, before it went free with subscription and IAP support. While I’m a little sad to be bothered by requests to partake in such things, I can’t deny the software authors the right to try and keep a great product generating revenue, and this is a great product (and the IAP is a little less ever-present now than it once was in the latest release). While Apple has added some great new features to their own iOS calendar, WeekCalendar still has the best means of interacting with data a week at a time, and using it has been easy. It integrates very well with both the iOS calendar and Google calendar. \n\nIf there is a complaint to be had it is that it leans quite heavily on Apple’s own Calendar app to provide some of the core functionality. Week Calendar builds on it but cannot fully supplant it. All part of Apple’s plan, perhaps?","title":"Great app that’s been my go-to calendar","userName":"CleveNoob"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6990018954","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-13T17:15:05Z","rating":1,"review":"I have had the WeekCal APP for about 9-10 years. I purchased the full APP back then. It's great! I shared it with 4 other dives in my household. And I used Family Sharing to post events, etc.. Prior to 4 days ago, everything worked GREAT!! I noticed that colors changed on my calendar by itself? Neither of the 4 other iPhones are able to share my new inputted calendar events. (Meaning, they cannot see on their calendars what I place on mine). And, I cannot see on my phone, what they put on theirs. Also, NOW, they are being asked to purchase the PRO Update. What is going on? What was once a great app with no issues is becoming a bad thought.\n\nThe above is a message I sent out over a year ago. After that message went out, somehow, things went back to normal. Thank you. But now as of Feb 13, 2021, I am finding out that only 2 out of 5 devices I shared the paid app with are functioning correctly. On three of our devices, it’s saying in order to unlock features, I have to upgrade the app. Again, I paid for the app 10-11 years ago and shared it with my families phones. Their phones stopped functioning fully at the beginning of 2021. I did not find out about this till now.

You will no longer be able to swipe between months.** I updated my app and now I must subscribe to get the functionality back that I had before. I purchased this app years ago (it was not a free download). Very frustrating that users are not warned of this before updating. In mini month view, I have a pop up prompting me to subscribe. I cannot swipe to other months or use the drop down. This has been my calendar for 10 years and now I’m held hostage because I was not warned before I updated. An app should never become less functional when you update it!\nUpdate: I have contacted Week Calendar through the app. They asked questions and requested screenshots and video. I have also submitted the information they requested showing that the app was purchased 10 years ago prior to Family Share when my husband and I shared an iTunes account. For some reason, this is the update that triggered the subscription prompt (we’ve been using Family Share for awhile). My husband has the app in his phone, but doesn’t use it ever; however it is working fine.

I stand by the one star rating though. This is the second time the developers have pulled this stunt in two years. \n\nOriginal review: Over six years ago, I paid for the pro version because this was THE BEST calendar in the App Store at the time. It was a one time payment. As other reviews have pointed out with the most recent upgrade, I can’t click on an event to see the details, swipe to a different month, basically I can’t do anything without getting a pop up screen that says I need to pay for the pro version (again) AND now it’s an annual subscription. There’s another version of the app in the App Store that appears to be a one time payment but it’s $30 - the most expensive calendar app in the store! (This app is great when you have the basic features, but it’s not worth that much.) Either way, this developer isn’t respecting previous pro purchases and just wants more money out of longtime users! No longer recommend any app from them and looking at alternative calendar apps.","title":"Do not buy!
