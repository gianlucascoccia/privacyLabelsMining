      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I am really enjoying this game. I played a number of other games before I found the G5 games. Now they’re about the only ones I play. I love everything about them, The artistry is beautiful the thought and planning that goes into them surprising. They aren’t as simple as some of the other games you can find around. But mostly I like that they are fair. Of course they want you to buy supplies and stuff that’s why they created the game and I get that. But so many games are outrageously unfair in how much they want you to spend before you can progress a tiny little bit. When I found the G5 games I realized that these are games I could play, spend what I could afford, and really enjoy myself. This particular game is enchanting because of the era, But that’s what’s good about all of them, the themes. I like completing the collections, and I think even the Match3 games especially in the higher levels, while challenging, they are doable. I like that you can earn resources during the game and not have to buy every one. I love the different characters that turn up in each of the games. Overall I am highly impressed not only with this game but with all the G5 games that I have tried so far.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This game is so much fun. The artwork is gorgeous, with an intriguing story that keeps you plain to learn more. I am currently on the wedding event and I cannot play this and fast enough to find out what happens next before time is up. I also love the use of education. The game has words of Latin for language and references to Roman history. I think future events could build on the potential educational aspect of the game. Perhaps a quiz event where characters educate the players and ask questions to see what they learned about history culture and language used in the game and event. It would be excellent for younger players and older players alike.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is just like so many of G5’s games.  Survivors the Quest was the only exception and they seem to have stopped providing updates for that one, as well as several others.  In Jewels of Rome once you progress to level 3 in a location it starts getting stupid hard and after that forget about it if you don’t want to spend big bucks for tools or waste your energy allotment and time trying to complete a quest.  Plus many of the collections require so many combiners  (up to 90+ for non-event collections and 113 for an event collection; those combiners are not giftable).  You need a ton of friends who gift daily because it’s impossible to complete tasks in the locations that award the combiners.  The graphics earned the 2 stars, which are generally great in G5 games but that is all the praise I can offer.  The support staff are put in a truly terrible position because they really can’t do much, but it’s not their fault.  They seem to be great people who work for a company that genuinely does not care about anything but money.  I get it; it’s a business. I actually don’t mind spending for games I enjoy, but it should be reasonable...and enjoyable.  It’s not.  Peace out G5.</p>

am really enjoying this game. I played a number of other games before I found the G5 games. Now they’re about the only ones I play. I love everything about them, The artistry is beautiful the thought and planning that goes into them surprising. They aren’t as simple as some of the other games you can find around. But mostly I like that they are fair. Of course they want you to buy supplies and stuff that’s why they created the game and I get that. But so many games are outrageously unfair in how much they want you to spend before you can progress a tiny little bit. When I found the G5 games I realized that these are games I could play, spend what I could afford, and really enjoy myself. This particular game is enchanting because of the era, But that’s what’s good about all of them, the themes. I like completing the collections, and I think even the Match3 games especially in the higher levels, while challenging, they are doable. I like that you can earn resources during the game and not have to buy every one. I love the different characters that turn up in each of the games. Overall I am highly impressed not only with this game but with all the G5 games that I have tried so far.","title":"Enchanting","userName":"Samgirl27"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6377825786","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-08-30T16:15:12Z","developerResponse":{"id":17612747,"body":"Thank you so much for the appreciation and heartfelt review!

The artwork is gorgeous, with an intriguing story that keeps you plain to learn more. I am currently on the wedding event and I cannot play this and fast enough to find out what happens next before time is up. I also love the use of education. The game has words of Latin for language and references to Roman history. I think future events could build on the potential educational aspect of the game. Perhaps a quiz event where characters educate the players and ask questions to see what they learned about history culture and language used in the game and event.

Survivors the Quest was the only exception and they seem to have stopped providing updates for that one, as well as several others.  In Jewels of Rome once you progress to level 3 in a location it starts getting stupid hard and after that forget about it if you don’t want to spend big bucks for tools or waste your energy allotment and time trying to complete a quest.  Plus many of the collections require so many combiners  (up to 90+ for non-event collections and 113 for an event collection; those combiners are not giftable).  You need a ton of friends who gift daily because it’s impossible to complete tasks in the locations that award the combiners.  The graphics earned the 2 stars, which are generally great in G5 games but that is all the praise I can offer.  The support staff are put in a truly terrible position because they really can’t do much, but it’s not their fault.  They seem to be great people who work for a company that genuinely does not care about anything but money.  I get it; it’s a business. I actually don’t mind spending for games I enjoy, but it should be reasonable...and enjoyable.  It’s not.

Highly recommend but I do have one issue:\nIt starts to open and then just goes away. I updated it this morning and started having issues after playing it for maybe 30 minutes. I’ve tried opening it during airplane mode, opening it from the App Store, turning iPad off and back on, and many other things to get it to work but it shows the blue G5 screen, goes to the next screen with all the G5 games advertised where you click on continue to game, then the next screen shows that the game is loading but stops about 3/4 of the way and closes...please help me fix this or tell me what to do because I play this game daily and love this game!

The storyline is very engaging. There are so many different quests that at times the quest bar can be overwhelming. Nevertheless,there’s always something to do. What I love about this game compared to many others is that you don’t run out of energy immediately, and actually get to play. If I were going to change anything, it would be that it really isn’t possible to finish the levels in any kind of timely manner without power ups, and of course these must be purchased. However, I do find the purchase price is quite reasonable compared to other games. Occasionally, repeating a level over and over in order to get one specific random object is annoying. I have to say though, that it’s worth it, because I spend entirely too much time playing this game.","title":"Ridiculously addictive","userName":"starthistle68"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6006040869","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-05-28T18:41:01Z","developerResponse":{"id":15658122,"body":"Thank you for your feedback.

But it is the CHEATING of the game that put me over the edge. Yes you have to play level after level to get any rewards at times. But when you win tools and try to use them the game puts them in the MOST useless positions and at times puts them in places you can’t even use them. How about rewarding good game play. NOPE no rewards for you just cheat cheat cheat. You set up this move to compliment that move and the game screws you it does not reward good play. It at times, even when you clear a column will have put  or let a block fall that isn’t supposed to be there. You know because you just cleared the column.  So I am so tired of the cheating that G5 games does that I will tell all my friends to NEVER play theses games.

There are some game mechanics beyond just matching.  This game does have a few bad habits, though.  The same ads kept coming up without me pressing any buttons to see them, and I really don’t need to see the same ad twenty times.  Another pop up informed me that I had found an item which would allow me to visit the bank to buy stuff with real money.  I didn’t realize that wasting dollars was such a prize.  The game also pestered me for information that was none of its business, like my email address and my birthday.  I guess you have to decide how long you’re willing to put up with these annoyances to play a free game.

Again, you need so many assemblers and this further frustrates my enjoyment of game. I estimate I only get credited with 1/3 of the gifts. Many glitches in game that don’t seem to get fixed.\n\nEvery time I need to add to this review the rating drops a star. I started with a 5 star review in October and now I’m down to a 2 star rating.\n\nUpdate 1/28....I completed all the available quests over two weeks ago and no new quests have appeared since. Game is meaningless without quests to purse! I agree with other reviewers who talk about the game being heavily manipulated (I refer to them as f-you levels).
