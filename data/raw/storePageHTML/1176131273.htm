      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I hadn’t touched the remote desktop app line in a few years, but was pleasantly surprised by this app. I can run a VPN on both my host and mobile device, and connect over 4G just fine with almost 0 latency. <br /><br />Switching between monitors is easily accessible via on screen gestures, along with all the other tools you’d ever need while managing your desktop remotely. It’s surprising to me that an app this well done is free on the appstore.<br /><br />Huge props to all the devs and workers of AnyDesk.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I was scammed today by someone purporting to be from PayPal helping me with fraudulent activity with my PayPal account   He had me download this app and was guiding me to transfer money as part of the process to block these transactions   He must of had a big laugh on me because in the description he had me write “dummy #1”  He had me hang up with further instructions saying that someone else was going to call me with a phone number beginning with 725 As soon as we hung up  just  like he said that number called and the second person had me go to the app and go to my Venmo account which he explained to me was affiliated with PayPal and do another transfer but I didn’t do that one because I became really suspicious and told him I would call back when I verified with PayPal that this was part of their policy and procedure   Well, it wasn’t!!!!   Do not download this app if someone is trying to help you resolve a problem with any of your accounts <br /><br />My question is  and I hope someone can answer   Once I delete the app am I safe or is the damage done and they have my information</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>If someone calls and tells you that your phone has a virus and they are going to give your phone a diagnosis do not down load this app. They will use this app to get into your phone and control it. They will have access to all of your passwords and personal information. The guy that did mine tried to diagnose my phone with a virus so me be suspicious started asking him specific questions. He began stuttering and constantly clearing his throat. He asked me do I have an iPhone 12,11 or 10 which made it obvious this was a scam. First of all if you can see that I have an iPhone wouldn’t you know which number iPhone I have and he said not technically. Which made me question how does he even know that I have an iPhone. If he doesn’t know what number it is how does he know it’s an iPhone. I asked him what is all the information they have on me and he said my name and number. So if that’s all the info they have how does he know that my phone has a virus. 🤔 DONT DO IT, DOING IT WILL LEAD YOU TO REGRET IT FOREVER!!!!</p>

We take care to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purpose for which we process them, are erased or rectified without delay.\n\nWe respect the principle of refraining from personal data processing and the principle of data minimisation. We therefore only retain your personal data if it is necessary in order to achieve the purpose of the processing or for various retention periods specified by law. The relevant data are erased in accordance with the law if the relevant purpose ceases to exist as a result of the withdrawal of your consent and/or upon the expiration of the lawful retention period.\n\nFor the above reasons, we use computer security such as a firewall and data encryption to operate our Websites.

All that dragging is a pain.\n\nI’ve tried Ur several times and I still can’t figure out how to get a keyboard to appear so it’s basically useless.\n\nThere are better solutions but probably not free ones.","title":"Not a scam but not easy to use","userName":"Duck88abcd"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1176131273-appletvos","type":"media/app-platform","attributes":{"hasMessagesExtension":false,"isHiddenFromSpringboard":false,"offers":[{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=0\u0026salableAdamId=1176131273\u0026pricingParameters=STDQ\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=839894013","type":"get","priceFormatted":"$0.00","price":0,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":17943552}]},{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=0\u0026salableAdamId=1176131273\u0026pricingParameters=SWUPD\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=839894013","type":"update","priceFormatted":"$0.00","price":0,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":17943552}]}],"bundleId":"com.anydesk.AnyDesk","editorialArtwork":{"brandLogo":{"width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features114/v4/81/06/f6/8106f65f-9dd7-d960-fc6d-102bc3939685/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor4":"b7b7b7"}},"hasInAppPurchases":false,"isAppleWatchSupported":false,"isGameCenterEnabled":false,"isSiriSupported":false,"supportsGameController":false,"supportsPassbook":false,"releaseDate":"2017-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","requiresGameController":false,"subtitle":"Remote Desktop Software","screenshotsByType":{"appleTV":[{"width":3840,"height":2160,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/e8/a5/d6/e8a5d6c1-d302-e052-698d-eff68b803b5a/4f72b361-0144-44f4-86b2-67482c9f0dd6_First.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"1c1c1c","textColor3":"333333","textColor4":"494949"},{"width":3840,"height":2160,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/38/b6/36/38b6361a-ae47-ae08-1657-e2d2c92af2ad/e8e61d84-2884-42ad-93bd-31782a05420b_Menu.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"0d0e0e","textColor2":"2b2e2e","textColor3":"3d3e3e","textColor4":"555858"},{"width":3840,"height":2160,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/eb/b2/1b/ebb21bdf-6dd8-a556-944f-d141e992f7d4/9ec15e63-f5e0-42cc-af60-d6e950434c96_Seamless.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"0d0e0e","textColor2":"19293c","textColor3":"3d3e3e","textColor4":"475463"},{"width":3840,"height":2160,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/8a/3b/6b/8a3b6b8e-061e-7cfb-1e08-d15e61331685/92f96ab4-c8a9-426f-8e03-42fc93d4a785_Every2.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"ffffff","textColor1":"0d0e0e","textColor2":"1e2122","textColor3":"3d3e3e","textColor4":"4b4d4e"}]},"copyright":"© 2019 philandro Software GmbH","description":{"standard":"AnyDesk is the fastest and most affordable Remote Control Software in the world!\n\nDownload the latest AnyDesk version here: https://anydesk.com/download\n\nFAST - SECURE - FREE for personal use\n\nAnyDesk enables remote desktop operations with unparalleled performance.
