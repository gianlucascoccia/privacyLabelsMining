      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Have none of the developers ever used Netflix? Or actually tried watching anything on their own app? They would find the experience of their app in comparison to (any) streaming video app out there very frustrating. If say, you want to try re-watch an episode of a show you were watching... good effing luck</p>
