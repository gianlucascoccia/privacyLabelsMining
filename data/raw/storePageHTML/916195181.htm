      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is my favorite app to use when I want to add a cool filter to pictures. There is only one problem and it is a major problem because it keeps me from using this app when I really would like to. When I have decided on a filter and my picture looks perfect, I click on “SAVE” and it blurs out the edges of my photo. This blurring effect does not happen until the “SAVE” button is clicked on. While I’m editing the picture (choosing a filter) this blurring effect is not present on the photo, so I go from really loving the picture, to really not feeling it anymore once I click on save. That means in order to save the picture to my camera roll, the blurring effect on the edges has to be present. Please fix this or at least give us the option to remove that blurring effect. Thank you😊</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I really dislike the updated filters. It seems a lot of others do to. This USED to be my favorite photo editing app, all of my instagram photos are posted with these filters and now they’re completely gone. I really hate these overly edited filters, bring back the original filters PLEASE. People literally paid to have all the filters and now they’re just gone. Granted it was only .99 all I’m saying is this isn’t what I paid for and I would literally pay more to just have the old filters back. This is super annoying.<br /><br />Update: I had emailed them with my frustration and they emailed me back apologizing and said the original filters are restored back on the app. I looked in the App Store and sure enough, there was an update and they’re there! Thank you thank you! Updated my rating, this has been a long time favorite app for filters. The original filters are under the file name “ORG” some have the dust effect over them, you can toggle it off.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The update has made the app so terrible that it’s unusable. It blurs the edges so much that it looks like the subject was in motion when the pic was taken, which is not the nice subtle effect it had earlier. And there’s no way of making this new adjustment less visible. The texture feature doesn’t help anything, as there is no adjusting the effect, it just completely blurs out the images altogether or doesn’t let you use the filter..I’m super disappointed at the changes made. The app was perfect before this update. I don’t want blurry images that look like my phone needs glasses. Or want photos that look like I have to strain to see them thru the blurry filter. Super bummed as I had loved this app prior. And it has a lot of fun color effects and antiqued photos in the best retro ways. Now it seems more like an app to make your photos so blurry you’ll look like a misty ghost. ☹️<br /><br />Pleasssse bring back the last version where the blurring effect didn’t exist and the clarity was still there! The new update is soo bad. Really wish it would have just been left as is. The intense blur was unneeded and there’s not even a way to lessen the effect. The adjustment bars just make it worse. Please go back.</p>

There is only one problem and it is a major problem because it keeps me from using this app when I really would like to. When I have decided on a filter and my picture looks perfect, I click on “SAVE” and it blurs out the edges of my photo. This blurring effect does not happen until the “SAVE” button is clicked on. While I’m editing the picture (choosing a filter) this blurring effect is not present on the photo, so I go from really loving the picture, to really not feeling it anymore once I click on save. That means in order to save the picture to my camera roll, the blurring effect on the edges has to be present. Please fix this or at least give us the option to remove that blurring effect.

Granted it was only .99 all I’m saying is this isn’t what I paid for and I would literally pay more to just have the old filters back. This is super annoying.\n\nUpdate: I had emailed them with my frustration and they emailed me back apologizing and said the original filters are restored back on the app. I looked in the App Store and sure enough, there was an update and they’re there!

It blurs the edges so much that it looks like the subject was in motion when the pic was taken, which is not the nice subtle effect it had earlier. And there’s no way of making this new adjustment less visible. The texture feature doesn’t help anything, as there is no adjusting the effect, it just completely blurs out the images altogether or doesn’t let you use the filter..I’m super disappointed at the changes made. The app was perfect before this update. I don’t want blurry images that look like my phone needs glasses. Or want photos that look like I have to strain to see them thru the blurry filter. Super bummed as I had loved this app prior. And it has a lot of fun color effects and antiqued photos in the best retro ways. Now it seems more like an app to make your photos so blurry you’ll look like a misty ghost. ☹️\n\nPleasssse bring back the last version where the blurring effect didn’t exist and the clarity was still there! The new update is soo bad. Really wish it would have just been left as is. The intense blur was unneeded and there’s not even a way to lessen the effect. The adjustment bars just make it worse.

I loved this photo editing app over the summer over 2018 when I got the app up until this update. it’s over saturated over edited the light leaks are unneeded. you had a beautiful app with beautiful vintage filters. I got sad when you change the name of the filters to acronyms in one of the updates bc they had really cool original names and it was easier to figure out which filters were my favorite and which ones I liked the most but now this app has so much going on it’s so overwhelming. unless you guys get back to the basics and realize people do like vintage and classic like your original model instead of over saturated, super edited, with dust effects covering every inch then you’ll probably lose users who enjoyed how simple and great your app was before this awful update... guess i’ll just have to look for another rare gem to edit my pictures until you guys make some changes to this TERRIBLE update.","title":"loved it until the new update, please go back to the basics","userName":"sarahhoward_"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4222752161","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-05-28T03:42:11Z","developerResponse":{"id":9618808,"body":"Hi rythima, sorry to hear that you are not happy with the current state of the app. Would you mind further explaining the issue that you are having with the current filters?

The new features aren’t as useful as they used to be. The filters are not as cute and you cannot get the right quality like you used to. Pictures using this app now keep looking extremely childish.

It is a little frustrating that some filters you can’t change the opacity, and I really wish that there was a second opacity dial for the underlying filter used. For example if I chose a lens flare option, I can change the opacity of the flare, but not the overall color difference the filter adds. Sometimes I love the way I’ve edited a photo and just need a little something extra, but that’s where I am unable to use this app as it only functions at full opacity for many of the filters and there is no way to control the colorization opacity. I still love the filters, don’t get me wrong, but because of these things I don’t turn to this app as much as I would otherwise.","title":"Good filters","userName":"Amber Secola"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3393361242","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-11-08T04:56:38Z","developerResponse":{"id":8452642,"body":"Hi Mandybecca, sorry to hear that you did not have the most ideal experience with the app. We recently released an update, Version 2.0.5., that should improve your experience.

Yet, since the recent update it’s nearly impossible to add a filter to a photo and adjust the filter’a intensity to a finite degree. You still select a filter which will default to 100% intensity, however previously you were able to tap on your photo and move into a kind of “editing mode” where you wouldn’t be able to scroll to the next filter while running your fingers left and right to dial up and down the filter’s intensity. It seems like they’ve tried to integrate the swiping to get to the next filter and the photo adjustment options, and without any benefit to the user. I work in IT in software, networking, end user support, so if played with this app for 15 minutes and can’t get the tricks down since the update I’m presuming there’s not many other people who can either.

I give the app 5 stars because it’s brilliant at what it does, which is putting on old school filters.\n\nMy only problem is that the max resolution the photos are saved at is 872x872. It’s still relatively big, but in situations where I need a crisp photo that is a high resolution, it doesn't cut it. I’ve had 2048x2048 photos thrown in there and it always reduces to 872x872 when I need it to stay at 2048x2048. If the filters could be compatible with larger photos, that would make the app a million times better.\n\nOther than that, I’ll still use this filter app on the regular.","title":"Love these filters, but one small problem","userName":"SauceMilliken"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4560144283","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-08-03T07:09:22Z","rating":1,"review":"I was so sad that you guys updated this app, I loved it due to it it’s simplicity and aesthetic. It was so easy to navigate, and choose the intensity of the filter I wanted. All of the new additions to the app make my pics look like trashy photo booth edits from the 2000s. The original filters are there, but it won’t let me adjust the intensity of the filter. This was my all time FAVORITE app. I would recommend it to all of my friends when they asked me what photo editor I used. But no. Now I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. It is such a shame. Something that isn’t broken and has no problems at all, SHOULDN’T BE FIXED. I’m actually so sad that I just paid the six or so dollars it costs to buy all the filters, what a waste of money. There are so many people that share my same thoughts, and so I hope the app goes back to the way it was soon.
