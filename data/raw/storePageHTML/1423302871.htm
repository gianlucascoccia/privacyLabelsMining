We are partnering with breweries, distilleries, Michelin star chefs, food and drink experts, comedians, game show hosts and a plethora of storytellers across all genres that share our passion and drive for creativity, entertainment, and adventure.\n\nWhether you want to watch Zane Lamprey as he reignites his quest to uncover the greatest drinking destinations in the world on Four Sheets, or see BrewDog founders James Watt and Martin Dickie risk life and limb brewing beers on a moving train or under the ocean on The BrewDog Show, we’ve got you covered. Want to learn cocktail secrets from the greatest mixologists around? Or play bar trivia with legendary TV host Marc Summers? You’ll find it here. DrinkTV is your destination for drinks content with a healthy sense of humor.  We take quality seriously—but not ourselves.\n\nWe’re also serving up a curated selection of documentaries celebrating the best of drinks culture, from small business stories of brewers looking to stake a claim in the world of craft beer to the untold history behind absinthe and other favorite spirits.\n\nThis is liquid entertainment.  This is DrinkTV.\n\nUsers of this application can subscribe to optional auto-renewing subscriptions for DrinkTV Premium to obtain access to additional features.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The shows are okay but not really anything I could be glued to. I was originally excited for the network because of the BrewDogs show but only one episode has come out since it’s inception. Now that they’ve upgraded the app, they have reduced the price which is a welcome addition but I can no longer Chromecast which is a big step back for me. If this weren’t a free subscription from investing in the brewery, I’d have no part of this “network.”</p>

You should be aware that these sites are likely to be collecting information about what you are doing all around the internet, including on our website or APPs. So if you click on any of these buttons, these sites will be registering that action and may use that information.

If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at: privacy@DrinkTV.com  \nIf we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so or seek your consent, providing you with a clear, conspicuous and readily available mechanism for you to exercise your choice.\nPlease note that we may process your Personal Data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\nHow We Share Your Personal Data\nWe will not sell or rent to anyone the Personal Data provided to us or obtained by us.\nIn certain circumstances we will share your Personal Data with other parties.

We may transfer the Personal Data we collect about you to countries outside of the country in which the information originally was collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy.\nTRANSFERS OUT OF THE EEA\nIf you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) this may involve transferring your Personal Data outside of the EEA.

We cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website or APPs and any transmission is at your own risk.

When you leave our website or Apps, we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit.\nCOOKIES\nDrinkTV uses \"cookies\" on its sites and APPs. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's system that help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site or APPs.\nCookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site and APPs. Except where contacts elect to identify themselves for purposes of receiving information from DrinkTV, or inquiring as to a business relationship with DrinkTV, cookies are not linked to any personally identifiable information.\nCookies may be either \"persistent\" cookies or \"session\" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. You can disable or remove any cookies already stored on your computer, but these may stop our websites or APPs from functioning properly. \n\nCookies are also delicious treats, especially good with a glass of milk (think Santa Claus) or for dipping in coffee.\n\nData Retention\nWhere we collect your Personal Data, the length of time for which we retain it depends on the type of data, the purpose for which we use that data and our accounting, regulatory and legal data retention obligations. We do not retain Personal Data in an identifiable format for longer than is necessary.\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.\nWe will retain your Personal Data on our systems unless we have not had any meaningful contact with you (or, where appropriate, the company you are working for or with) for two years (or for such longer period as we believe in good faith that the law, statute or relevant regulators require us to preserve your data). After this period, it is likely your data will no longer be relevant for the purposes for which it was collected and we will delete or destroy it.\nIn some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.\n\nYour Legal Rights\nUnder certain circumstances, by you have the right to:\n\"\tRequest access to your personal information (commonly known as a \"data subject access request\"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;\n\"\tRequest correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected;\n\"\tRequest erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;\n\"\tObject to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a Legitimate Interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes;\n\"\tRequest the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it; and/or\n\"\tRequest the transfer of your personal information to another party.\n \nIf you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your Personal Data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact us by email at: privacy@DrinkTV.com.  \nNO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED\nYou will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.\nWHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU\nWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\nRIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT\nIn the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please send us an email at: privacy@DrinkTV.com. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, without undue delay, unless we have another legitimate legal basis for doing so.\nOUR RESPONSE TIMES\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is incomplete and we need to write to you for more information or is particularly complex or you have made several requests. In these cases, we will notify you and keep you updated.\nIN THE EU, THE RIGHT TO COMPLAIN TO A SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY \nIn the EU, if you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your principle residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. \nPlease see \"how to make a complaint\" below.\n\nHow to Make a Complaint\nData privacy laws are constantly evolving and we endeavor to maintain best practices. However, we recognize that we may not always get it right and if you are not satisfied in the way we handle your Personal Data or you wish to discuss our processes then we would like to hear from you.\nDRINKTV COMPLAINT PROCESS\nIf you believe that there is something which we have not done correctly with your Personal Data then we would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach a Supervisory Authority, so please contact us in the first instance at: privacy@DrinkTV.com.  \nDefinitions of Terms used in this Policy\nConsent means your agreement which must be freely given, specific, informed and be an unambiguous indication of you, the Data Subject's wishes, by which you, by a statement or by a clear positive action, signifies agreement to the Processing of Personal Data relating to you.\nData Controller means the person or organization that determines when, why and how to process your Personal Data.

These enable you to share or bookmark pages on our website or APPs. These may include buttons for: Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Facebook, Instagram or other social media platforms. In order for us to implement these buttons on our website or APPs and connect them to the relevant social networks and external sites, there are scripts that are executed from domains owned by third-parties and outside of our control. You should be aware that these sites are likely to be collecting information about what you are doing all around the internet, including on our website or APPs. So if you click on any of these buttons, these sites will be registering that action and may use that information. In some cases these sites will be registering the fact that you are visiting our website, and the specific pages you are on, even if you don't click on the button but are already or automatically logged into their services, like Google and Facebook. We recommend that you check the respective policies of each of these sites to see how exactly they use your personal information and to find out how to opt out, or delete, such personal information if you wish to.\n\nWhat Is the Legal Basis for Processing Your Data\nWe rely on the following main grounds to process Personal Data of website and APP users, suppliers or other third parties:\n\"\tNecessary for entering into, or performing, a contract - to perform obligations that we undertake in providing a service to you, or to take steps at your request to enter into a contract with us;\n\"\tNecessary for compliance with a legal obligation - we are subject to certain legal requirements which may require us to process your Personal Data. We may also be obliged by law to disclose your Personal Data to a regulatory body or law enforcement agency;\n\"\tNecessary for the purposes of Legitimate Interests - we, or a third party, will process your Personal Data for the purposes of our (or a third party's) Legitimate Interests, provided we have established that those interests are not overridden by your rights and freedoms, including your right to have your Personal Data protected. Our Legitimate Interests include responding to requests and enquiries from you or a third party, optimizing our website, APPs and customer experience, informing you about our products and services and ensuring that our operations are conducted in an appropriate and efficient manner;\n\"\tConsent - in some circumstances, we may ask for your consent to process your Personal Data;\n\"\tNecessary to protect the vital interests of you the data subject or of another natural person.\n \nCHANGE OF PURPOSE\nWe will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at: privacy@DrinkTV.com  \nIf we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so or seek your consent, providing you with a clear, conspicuous and readily available mechanism for you to exercise your choice.\nPlease note that we may process your Personal Data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.\n\nHow We Share Your Personal Data\nWe will not sell or rent to anyone the Personal Data provided to us or obtained by us.\nIn certain circumstances we will share your Personal Data with other parties. We share your data with other entities within DrinkTV acting as joint controllers or processors. We do this to provide sales and marketing, IT, system administration services, product development and undertake internal reporting. We will also share your Personal Data across DrinkTV entities to improve our customer service and to make our services more valuable to you.\nWe also share your Personal Data with the following third parties:\n\"\tService providers acting as processors who provide IT and system administration services, including, for example: Stripe, WordPress, Amazon AWS, and Castlabs, etc.;\n\"\tProfessional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers;\n\"\tRegulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances; \n\"\tThird parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your Personal Data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy.\n \nWe require all third parties to respect the security of your Personal Data and to treat it in accordance with applicable laws. We do not allow our third party service providers to use your Personal Data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your Personal Data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.\nWe also collect, use and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data for our legitimate business purposes. Aggregated data is not Personal Data as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. \n\nInternational Transfers of Data\nWe share your Personal Data within DrinkTV. We may transfer the Personal Data we collect about you to countries outside of the country in which the information originally was collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy.\nTRANSFERS OUT OF THE EEA\nIf you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) this may involve transferring your Personal Data outside of the EEA. Whenever we transfer your Personal Data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented.\nGENERAL SAFEGUARDS\n \n\"\tWe will only transfer your Personal Data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of Personal Data in non-EU countries.\n\"\tWhere we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give Personal Data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of Personal Data to third countries.\n\n\nData Security\nDrinkTV uses industry standard physical, technical, and administrative controls to protect your Personal Data by:\n\"\tNot collecting or retaining excessive amounts of data;\n\"\tProtecting Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access and disclosure. Any employees, agents, contractors or third parties who are so authorized act on our instructions are subject to a duty of confidentiality;\n\"\tKeeping Personal Data up to date;\n\"\tStoring and destroying it securely;\n\"\tEnsuring that appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards are in place to protect Personal Data. These measures include measures to deal with any suspected data breach; and\n\"\tRegularly reviewing our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures.\n\nWhile we operate to the highest standards we are also aware that the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website or APPs and any transmission is at your own risk. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access any of our online or electronic resources, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We advise you not to share your password with anyone.\nYou should note that this website and our APPs may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their content or privacy statements. When you leave our website or Apps, we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit.\nCOOKIES\nDrinkTV uses \"cookies\" on its sites and APPs. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's system that help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site or APPs.\nCookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site and APPs. Except where contacts elect to identify themselves for purposes of receiving information from DrinkTV, or inquiring as to a business relationship with DrinkTV, cookies are not linked to any personally identifiable information.\nCookies may be either \"persistent\" cookies or \"session\" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. You can disable or remove any cookies already stored on your computer, but these may stop our websites or APPs from functioning properly. \n\nCookies are also delicious treats, especially good with a glass of milk (think Santa Claus) or for dipping in coffee.\n\nData Retention\nWhere we collect your Personal Data, the length of time for which we retain it depends on the type of data, the purpose for which we use that data and our accounting, regulatory and legal data retention obligations. We do not retain Personal Data in an identifiable format for longer than is necessary.\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.\nWe will retain your Personal Data on our systems unless we have not had any meaningful contact with you (or, where appropriate, the company you are working for or with) for two years (or for such longer period as we believe in good faith that the law, statute or relevant regulators require us to preserve your data). After this period, it is likely your data will no longer be relevant for the purposes for which it was collected and we will delete or destroy it.\nIn some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.\n\nYour Legal Rights\nUnder certain circumstances, by you have the right to:\n\"\tRequest access to your personal information (commonly known as a \"data subject access request\"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;\n\"\tRequest correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected;\n\"\tRequest erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;\n\"\tObject to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a Legitimate Interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes;\n\"\tRequest the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it; and/or\n\"\tRequest the transfer of your personal information to another party.\n \nIf you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your Personal Data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact us by email at: privacy@DrinkTV.com.  \nNO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED\nYou will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.\nWHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU\nWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\nRIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT\nIn the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please send us an email at: privacy@DrinkTV.com. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, without undue delay, unless we have another legitimate legal basis for doing so.\nOUR RESPONSE TIMES\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is incomplete and we need to write to you for more information or is particularly complex or you have made several requests. In these cases, we will notify you and keep you updated.\nIN THE EU, THE RIGHT TO COMPLAIN TO A SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY \nIn the EU, if you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your principle residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. \nPlease see \"how to make a complaint\" below.\n\nHow to Make a Complaint\nData privacy laws are constantly evolving and we endeavor to maintain best practices. However, we recognize that we may not always get it right and if you are not satisfied in the way we handle your Personal Data or you wish to discuss our processes then we would like to hear from you.\nDRINKTV COMPLAINT PROCESS\nIf you believe that there is something which we have not done correctly with your Personal Data then we would appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach a Supervisory Authority, so please contact us in the first instance at: privacy@DrinkTV.com.  \nDefinitions of Terms used in this Policy\nConsent means your agreement which must be freely given, specific, informed and be an unambiguous indication of you, the Data Subject's wishes, by which you, by a statement or by a clear positive action, signifies agreement to the Processing of Personal Data relating to you.\nData Controller means the person or organization that determines when, why and how to process your Personal Data.

distillers and vintners who create the magical liquids in our glasses, and of course all the new friends we make along the way in our ABV adventures.\n\nOriginal long and short form series will explore stories in the worlds of cocktails and spirits, beer, wine, food, comedy and lifestyle.  We are partnering with breweries, distilleries, Michelin star chefs, food and drink experts, comedians, game show hosts and a plethora of storytellers across all genres that share our passion and drive for creativity, entertainment, and adventure.\n\nWhether you want to watch Zane Lamprey as he reignites his quest to uncover the greatest drinking destinations in the world on Four Sheets, or see BrewDog founders James Watt and Martin Dickie risk life and limb brewing beers on a moving train or under the ocean on The BrewDog Show, we’ve got you covered. Want to learn cocktail secrets from the greatest mixologists around? Or play bar trivia with legendary TV host Marc Summers? You’ll find it here. DrinkTV is your destination for drinks content with a healthy sense of humor.  We take quality seriously—but not ourselves.\n\nWe’re also serving up a curated selection of documentaries celebrating the best of drinks culture, from small business stories of brewers looking to stake a claim in the world of craft beer to the untold history behind absinthe and other favorite spirits.\n\nThis is liquid entertainment.
