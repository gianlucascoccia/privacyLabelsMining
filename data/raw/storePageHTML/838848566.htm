It’s the most fun way to meet up — or just see what’s up! — so even when you’re apart, you can feel together. Zenly is an app from Snap Inc. that millions of people around the world use. Here’s what it can do: \n\nMEET UP WITH FRIENDS \n*See exactly where your friends are and what they’re up to\n*Know which friends are awake and ready to hang out\n*Get to your friends without asking for the address\n*Know when your friends are on the move and how fast they’re moving \n*Know when they’re at home, at school, at work and when they’re on their way to any of those places\n\nFIND THE PARTY\n*Know when your friends are together with fire on the map and create a group chat in a tap\n*When you do meet up, Bump phones with friends to let others know you’re hanging out \n\nFEEL THE LOVE \n*Blast your friends with your favorite emojis (hint: sound on) \n*Know when your friends run out of battery when you can’t reach them\n*See how much of the map you’ve explored with Footprints and compete with friends\n*Get notified when your friends travel to different countries\n\nUSE WITH LOVE \n*Blur or freeze yourself to get off the grid for as long as you need \n*Zenly is for best friends only. We have a number of ways you can add friends on Zenly, but remember that your friend will need to accept your request before you can see them on your map! \n\nZenly is free to use and without ads (yay!).

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’m going to keep this short because I ate too much chocolate ice cream on Valentine’s Day and I’m still recovering (please send hugs). I’ve got soooo much good stuff in store for you this week, here’s what to look out for:<br /><br />Footprints has received a little redesign. It’s lowkey, I don’t want to make too much of a big deal about it, but I think you’re going to love it. And while I was at it, I created a new world leaderboard, so you can compete with friends for world domination! Take a peak by hitting the crown at the top right-hand side of your map.<br /><br />Remember that time your friend shared that heavenly ice cream flavor with you? And then you forgot? And now you can’t sleep at night? Try out the new and improved inbox search to find old messages (and ice cream recommendations).<br /><br />Can you keep a secret? I added some special emoji combinations into Zenly this week for you. When you’re chatting with friends, try sending 3 of the same emojis. If you get the right combination, there’s a surprise in store…<br /><br />That’s all! Love you more than chocolate ice cream.</p>

As a mother this is a gift!<br /><br />Update : this used to be the best tracking app until lately . With each update it started to mess up . It is now no longer tracking and the person is in sane place fir days . I had both phones with me just to see and still it could not locate . It said reasoning was off , no service , hiding from me etc but all were impossible as I has the phone . I will delete permanent soon of can&#39;t get too work . Sad as I campaign this app at work but lately it&#39;s being disappointing</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve never written reviews before but this is just beyond sad and frustrating. So one day my account just disappeared. Yes like, boom, gone. I opened the app and it got logged out automatically, I tried logging in with my number but it created a new account. I tried contacting support and they said it’s permanently deleted and cannot be recovered. So I lost everything, footprints, friends. I mean the information has got to be somewhere right? On the website it even says it’ll be kept for 30 days. Not to say I didn’t even try deleting my account Zenly just did it. I’ll never be able to get those footprints back now, which is also the main reason I used Zenly. It’ll be impossible to get the same footprints either. The feeling is like having your memory card formatted by someone else. So unless they somehow miraculously found my old account back I don’t want to use this anymore. What if they deleted my account again? I don’t wanna be heartbroken twice. No I’m not giving them another chance. Am I the only one that experienced this? Wow unbelievable can I be more lucky than that. Wish I was lucky in other ways. A simple wish would just be to get my account back🙄🙄</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Overall, the app itself is pretty great as of being a location - based app. It’s great that you can easily interact with friends and see where they constantly are. What I see as a problem is not having a “log out” option. As I was changing my phone to my new one, I have realized that Zenly doesn’t have an “Log out” option. In that case, I am pretty disappointed. If you have deleted the app, your friends would see the last location where were last and if you were to download it again, it would pop your account again! What if I have selled my phone to a stranger and they’ve found my account? Theyre going to hijack it. How am I going to log on back there on my new phone. Yeah, you’ll have to create a new account and add your friends all over again. Please reconsider this problem. Thank you.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hey, thanks for the feedback. 🙏 What I&#39;d recommend in this case is to delete Zenly from your device before selling it. If the new owner downloads Zenly they&#39;ll need access to your phone number to receive the verification code before accessing your account. If you got a new number just let us know and we&#39;ll get your account moved over to your number. See, no sweat. 😅 Always here if needed 👉 love@zen.ly 💌 Bryan 🤗</p>

This is going to be a good one, I can just feel it. \n\nI’ve got lots of fun things planned for the year ahead, but to get the ball rolling be sure to check out the new gatherings feature in Zenly this week. It’s now easier for you to know who is in the mix when a bunch of your friends hang out together. Tap the hangout flame to see who’s there, how long they’ve been there, and quickly start a group chat to let them know you’re on your way to boogie. Groovy baby.\n\nPS - I made a list of some other things to look forward to this year:\n1. More time with friends (digitally or IRL. Please let it be IRL)\n2. Finally finding out who’s behind those giant monoliths\n3. Eating my body weight in ice cream \n4. Potentially also finding out what’s going on in Area 51 \n5.

So one day my account just disappeared. Yes like, boom, gone. I opened the app and it got logged out automatically, I tried logging in with my number but it created a new account. I tried contacting support and they said it’s permanently deleted and cannot be recovered. So I lost everything, footprints, friends. I mean the information has got to be somewhere right? On the website it even says it’ll be kept for 30 days. Not to say I didn’t even try deleting my account Zenly just did it. I’ll never be able to get those footprints back now, which is also the main reason I used Zenly. It’ll be impossible to get the same footprints either. The feeling is like having your memory card formatted by someone else. So unless they somehow miraculously found my old account back I don’t want to use this anymore. What if they deleted my account again? I don’t wanna be heartbroken twice. No I’m not giving them another chance. Am I the only one that experienced this?

What I see as a problem is not having a “log out” option. As I was changing my phone to my new one, I have realized that Zenly doesn’t have an “Log out” option. In that case, I am pretty disappointed. If you have deleted the app, your friends would see the last location where were last and if you were to download it again, it would pop your account again! What if I have selled my phone to a stranger and they’ve found my account? Theyre going to hijack it. How am I going to log on back there on my new phone. Yeah, you’ll have to create a new account and add your friends all over again. Please reconsider this problem.

It’s so accurate and up to date, but one thing i don’t like is that it says you were watched by 3 friends and it has no names. I hope you guys don’t ignore me, the reason why I am giving this app 4 stars and not 5 is because you can’t see who you were watched by. My family is big and I have like 8 friends in Zenly and I would like to know who watch me and who doesn’t. But other than that everything is perfect. Please fix this and let us know who watched us.
