      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>v2.1.5<br />• General polish &amp; fixes.<br /><br />v2.1<br />We have some great new features in this update:<br /><br />GROUPING<br />You can now make a selection with the Lasso Knife and group those items together into a single object.  This is a powerful new feature that makes it quick and easy to make reusable drawings which can be easily selected, overlapped and rearranged.  To use grouping, simply tap the chain icon once you make a selection.  You can ungroup by tapping the broken chain icon.<br /><br />VISUAL CLIPBOARD<br />There is a shiny new icon in the top bar – say hello to the visual clipboard.  Your most recent items that have been copied to the clipboard will appear here, making it quick and easy to copy complex selections, especially between different documents. Just tap an item to insert it to your active document.<br /><br />COMING SOON<br />We are working on an awesome new feature that starts with R and ends in ULER.  We can’t wait to bring it to you and will be sharing more details soon.<br /><br /><br />v2.0.3<br />•Fixed a crash seen by some of our users<br /><br /><br />v2.0.2<br />• Improved gesture support.<br />• General polish &amp; fixes.<br /><br /><br />v2.0.1<br />• General polish &amp; fixes.<br /><br /><br />v2.0<br />REALTIME COLLABORATION:<br />With Flow 2, multiple people can work on the same document at the same time from separate devices wherever they are in the world. It’s a truly groundbreaking way to collaborate, now more than ever. We had architects who wanted to mark out designs with their assistant who’s based on the other side of town. Employers needing to collaborate with their staff that are working from home. Grandparents wanting to color in with their grandchildren remotely.<br /><br /><br />VERTICAL DOCUMENTS<br />You now have the option to choose a vertical document if top-to-bottom infinite canvas works better for you than side to side infinite canvas. You choose orientation when creating a new document, and this cannot be changed once set.<br /><br /><br />PENCIL CASE MODE<br />We want Flow to disappear when you’re using it, so we invented Pencil Case mode to give the option of taking your tools away from your iPad screen entirely and putting them on your iPhone instead. It separates the artistic and utilitarian sides of your creation so you can have a clean space to work - without the clutter of your tools. You simply place your iPad and iPhone side by side, open Flow on both of them and through magic (or rather some very clever coding) your tools are shown on your iPhone. Just make sure you are signed into the same Flow account on both devices.<br /><br /><br />IMAGES<br />You may have noticed we quietly launched this recently but now it’s ready for everyone. Here’s what you can do:<br /><br />- Add images to your document from Photo Library or Files (including iCloud, Dropbox, Adobe Creative Cloud, Box, OneDrive, Google Drive, Amazon)<br />- Take photos directly in Flow and then draw on top of them<br />- Paste images from your clipboard, even from your other devices like Mac using Universal Clipboard<br />- Drag and drop to grab images from other apps<br />- Use the Lasso Knife tool for rotating, resizing and moving your image <br />- Duplicate images to save you from adding the image again<br />- Change the opacity by using the long press menu<br /><br /><br />MORE<br /><br />- All new sync engine - performance and stability are better than ever thanks to our all new sync engine, built from the ground up.<br />- Flow on iPhone - now opens documents in read-only mode so it’s easier to navigate without accidentally drawing.  Tap and hold the pen icon to open your tools.<br />- Clipboard - copy lasso selections to your clipboard and paste into other Flow documents.  If you have universal clipboard enabled, you can paste an image directly onto your Mac or other iOS/iPadOS device in any app.<br /><br />If you experience any issues at all, our team is here to help - just email flow@moleskinestudio.com or tap Help &gt; Talk To Our Team from the Flow menu.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Learn from 53, Flow team. Once upon a time there was an app called Paper, by 53. It failed to improve and progress the way it’s users needed it to and now it’s a piece of crap. You guys are riding a very thin line with having minimal tools and options while still remaining relevant and having a very elegant app that’s a joy to use. As long as apps like Procreate exist, where you only pay once and can be as “pro” or as basic as you want with it, Flow is going to be a challenging sell. You’re riding on brand and aesthetics and that may not carry you forever. <br />But I get the vision of Flow and I personally love it. I’m a graphic designer, so it’s nice having a digital space to draw and think while not worrying about layers or being too granular with my sketches. Flow gives me permission to be messy, and I like that. <br />The paper formats are nice, I’ve found myself using the ruled format from time to time to take notes since Flow has my favorite interface (and sounds!) of any drawing app...so why not? Tools are great, I love the color picker and lack of total freedom while still having a TON of options. I don’t feel restricted with color. <br />I’d be wary with adding much in the way of functionality, but new tools from time to time would be fun. I’m looking forward to the app getting better at what it already does as opposed to becoming more feature-heavy.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I fell in love with the beautiful UI and clean aesthetic of this app during my demo, and will definitely be willing to pay the reasonable $12/yr to keep enjoying it (please just don’t bump that price back up to $30). The sight of my digital notebook spreads looking just like my physical ones is super satisfying; it truly does make me want to keep writing and writing, whether it’s journal entries, work notes, or sketches.<br /><br />There are still some visible rough edges, though. Resolution gets very blurry when you scroll through pages of a single file, and there’s no way to zoom out and view the whole thing. The minimal interface is a selling point so they shouldn’t clutter it, but certain organizational features and customization options (ex. better file management, the ability to save default page setups) are absent, and sorely missed. I expect quality from Moleskine and think, especially since this not just a paid app but part of a subscription service, they still have work to do. Assuming they continue to refine the app though I will gladly comes back to renew my subscription.</p>

As always, message us directly from the Help screen with any feedback and ideas you have. \n\n- New Background Pattern Options -\nYou can now adjust the opacity of background patterns and choose between small or large scale.\n\n- New Isometric Background Pattern -\nIf you feel passionately about angles, you know what we’re talking about.\n\n- Improved Scrubber -\nThe scrubber for navigating your document now hides along with other interface elements when in fullscreen mode.\n\nIt also now hides when zooming your document so there is less chance of bumping it.\n\n- Lasso Knife Enhancement -\nThe Lasso Knife now places your selection when you tap another tool (thanks for pointing this out Guilherme!).  We’ve also fixed some rare bugs with z order.\n\n- Reduced Drawing Safe Area around UI -\nYou can now start drawing closer to the tool editor.\n\nv1.1.1:\nFixes a rare bug that could cause the app to crash at launch.\n\nv1.1:\nA wild tool appears! Introducing the new Lasso Knife tool, a powerful new way to create with Flow.\n\n- Move and rotate -\nWith the Lasso Knife you can trace around parts of your drawing that you want to select and edit. The selected strokes lift off the page, you can move them by dragging around and tap to place them back down. When you have something selected you can also use two fingers to rotate.\n\n- Duplicate -\nYou can copy anything you have selected by tapping the duplicate button on the tool editor. If you are using an Apple Pencil you can also press and hold a finger down then drag with the Pencil to create a copy.\n\n- Select by pen type -\nThe Lasso Knife allows you to choose what kind of pen strokes it selects from the page. You can toggle each option from the tool editor when the Lasso Knife is your active tool. This is super handy when you want to edit just one part of your drawing, for example you can select just the graphite pencil lines from a sketch you’ve drawn over top of with a fineliner pen. \n\n- Recolor -\nYou can change the color of any strokes you have selected, just press on the recolor icon and drag over your page or pens to get a new color. This feature becomes extra powerful when combined with selecting by pen type - for example you can select just the chisel marker shading on your drawing and modify its color. \n\n\nWe are working around the clock to update and improve Flow. If you enjoy using Flow we'd really appreciate if you had a moment to leave a review. If you've got a question or something isn't working quite right please email us.

from 53, Flow team. Once upon a time there was an app called Paper, by 53. It failed to improve and progress the way it’s users needed it to and now it’s a piece of crap. You guys are riding a very thin line with having minimal tools and options while still remaining relevant and having a very elegant app that’s a joy to use. As long as apps like Procreate exist, where you only pay once and can be as “pro” or as basic as you want with it, Flow is going to be a challenging sell. You’re riding on brand and aesthetics and that may not carry you forever. \nBut I get the vision of Flow and I personally love it. I’m a graphic designer, so it’s nice having a digital space to draw and think while not worrying about layers or being too granular with my sketches. Flow gives me permission to be messy, and I like that. \nThe paper formats are nice, I’ve found myself using the ruled format from time to time to take notes since Flow has my favorite interface (and sounds!) of any drawing app...so why not? Tools are great, I love the color picker and lack of total freedom while still having a TON of options. I don’t feel restricted with color. \nI’d be wary with adding much in the way of functionality, but new tools from time to time would be fun. I’m looking forward to the app getting better at what it already does as opposed to becoming more feature-heavy.","title":"Don’t add much, just make it better.","userName":"everette23"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4994975778","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-10-22T00:36:19Z","rating":4,"review":"I fell in love with the beautiful UI and clean aesthetic of this app during my demo, and will definitely be willing to pay the reasonable $12/yr to keep enjoying it (please just don’t bump that price back up to $30). The sight of my digital notebook spreads looking just like my physical ones is super satisfying; it truly does make me want to keep writing and writing, whether it’s journal entries, work notes, or sketches.\n\nThere are still some visible rough edges, though. Resolution gets very blurry when you scroll through pages of a single file, and there’s no way to zoom out and view the whole thing. The minimal interface is a selling point so they shouldn’t clutter it, but certain organizational features and customization options (ex. better file management, the ability to save default page setups) are absent, and sorely missed. I expect quality from Moleskine and think, especially since this not just a paid app but part of a subscription service, they still have work to do. Assuming they continue to refine the app though I will gladly comes back to renew my subscription.","title":"Great app, still room to grow","userName":"C C Cohen"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4279494063","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-06-07T19:54:14Z","developerResponse":{"id":9080023,"body":"Hi SerenityJLee, Thank you for your kind words and thoughtful review! 😍","modified":"2019-06-10T01:55:50Z"},"rating":5,"review":"I use Procreate and GoodNotes for when I need to get really in depth with my notes or drawing. I’ve been craving an app that has a beautiful, intuitive interface and is simple enough for me to quickly open and use it. Flow is inviting for someone somewhat unartistic as me to use, but I can also see its implications for more detailed sketching. I consider that this app is freshly made and so many features are on the way, and the team of developers is attentive to community suggestions although it is a small team. You can tell a good app by its developer response, so I have a lot of hope for the future of this one. I’m going to use the app more as it evolves, but I’m very pleased now. As to anyone who claims the app is too expensive—$12 once a year is not too much to pay if you pay about that much for a notebook you use in your hands from a bookstore. This app is a well executed attempt to emulate that personal experience with a paper notebook. That’s not easy, but it’s one of the reasons I purchased my iPad Pro with pencil. And if you’re a user that has the same intent as me, who’s already spent $900 or so on an iPad and pencil for that experience, another $12 every year is well worth it for the value returned.

While apps like ArtStudio Pro, Infinite Painter and Procreate are the go to’s for mobile professional level concept, illustration and sketching, this app offers a completely unique and wonderful experience! No fuss, just iteration and ideation...just like a real sketchbook. The infinite pages is amazing for concepting hundreds of ideas without settings and layers getting in the way.\n\nIf you are looking for a professional painting app, look at the other big players. But if you want to DESIGN, without worry, just you and your page, uninterrupted, this app is definitely for you. I will be recommending this heavily to my peers in Film and Games, especially those working on new projects during the visual development and world building phase. The way that exporting works is fantastic!\n\nI half want a ruler and eclipse tool, but a real sketch book doesn’t have those things (though I will use a straight edge regularly in mine)..so I also think I am ok without them. My only real complaint is that I wish the markers didn’t blend so hard, especially as they are the primary feature of the app. But overall this is a win. Glad I discovered it.

The ability to have customized “pens” on the side for quick switching is great. I prefer the black paper and using white primarily. Also being able to side scroll forever means I can be messy and have plenty of space at all times. The customizable gestures is a key feature for Apple Pen users.\nWish list:\n**More vertical scrolling space. I feel limited when drawing diagrams and run out of vertical space. It’s a common issue. Wish the page was optionally 2 (maybe 4) times taller.\n**End-to-end encryption. Currently data is encrypted in transit, and at rest, but is decrypted in between.

It had some issues here and there especially syncing between the iPhone app and the iPad one, but that was ok overall and anyway I mostly use my iPad to draw so I got rid of the iPhone app. Then update came and I was very excited especially the pencil case option. But again that fell short and turned out to be very clunky and I thought that I can do without it. Syncing was still a problem also. But more importantly, I can’t open my old sketchbooks anymore and every time I open one the drawing don’t download and I keep seeing the little swirling ink blot. As such I lost a few drawings because they don’t load anymore. Furthermore, since the latest updates, the scrubber does not show all the drawings. So bottom line with every update the problems with this app seem to build up and at this point I don’t trust it anymore to use it as often. I gave it 3 stars because I still think that it’s got the potential of being a great app and it still can be fixed.","title":"What’s happening?","userName":"wassim73"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6075968046","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-06-14T19:56:36Z","rating":5,"review":"The reason I bought my iPad Pro is to use this app! Last December I visited the Apple Store in the UWS and played around with the iPad Pro they had on display. They had this app open and I fell in love. In Feb for my bday I got myself an iPad Pro and immediately subscribed after I couldn’t stop drawing with it after the free trial. I used to draw daily in my sketchbook, but now I draw daily with Flow on my iPad instead. It is easier to share my drawings from the app, rather than trying to take good photos of works on paper. I highly recommend this app for artists! My only wishes are for more vertical space when in Portrait mode and for higher quality image saves when saving to camera roll. I usually end up taking a screenshot of my drawings, rather than saving to the camera roll from inside the app. I have used Procreate, and it was not for me, as I am looking for something that feels like I am drawing in a sketchbook.

I used to buy so many Moleskine notebooks and still do, but I love having this app on my iPad.

So you draw on your iPad and your tools are on your iPhone. This clears up your iPad screen for full immersion in your project. Just like a physical notebook. \n\nYou simply place your iPad and iPhone side by side, open Flow on both of them and through magic (or rather some very clever coding) your tools are shown on your iPhone. Just make sure you are signed into the same Flow account on both devices.\n\n\nIMAGES\nYou may have noticed we quietly launched this recently but now it’s ready for everyone. Here’s what you can do:\n\n- Add images to your document from Photo Library or Files (including iCloud, Dropbox, Adobe Creative Cloud, Box, OneDrive, Google Drive, Amazon)\n- Take photos directly in Flow and then draw on top of them\n- Paste images from your clipboard, even from your other devices like Mac using Universal Clipboard\n- Drag and drop to grab images from other apps\n- Use the Lasso Knife tool for rotating, resizing and moving your image \n- Duplicate images to save you from adding the image again\n- Change the opacity by using the long press menu\n\n\nMORE\n\n- All new sync engine - performance and stability are better than ever thanks to our all new sync engine, built from the ground up.\n- Flow on iPhone - now opens documents in read-only mode so it’s easier to navigate without accidentally drawing.  Tap and hold the pen icon to open your tools.\n- Clipboard - copy lasso selections to your clipboard and paste into other Flow documents.  If you have universal clipboard enabled, you can paste an image directly onto your Mac or other iOS/iPadOS device in any app.\n\nIf you experience any issues at all, our team is here to help - just email flow@moleskinestudio.com or tap Help \u003e Talk To Our Team from the Flow menu.","releaseDate":"2020-11-06"},{"versionDisplay":"2.0","releaseNotes":"REALTIME COLLABORATION:\nWith Flow 2, multiple people can work on the same document at the same time from separate devices wherever they are in the world. It’s a truly groundbreaking way to collaborate, now more than ever. We had architects who wanted to mark out designs with their assistant who’s based on the other side of town. Employers needing to collaborate with their staff that are working from home. Grandparents wanting to color in with their grandchildren remotely.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n- Tap the collaboration button on any document and share the link with who you want to collaborate with\n- You’ll get notifications when someone is editing\n- You can use FaceTime picture-in-picture so you can chat while you collaborate\n- For bigger groups, you can broadcast your collaboration via Zoom\n\n\nVERTICAL DOCUMENTS\nYou now have the option to choose a vertical document if top-to-bottom infinite canvas works better for you than side to side infinite canvas.

This release contains fun new features as requested by you. As always, message us directly from the Help screen with any feedback and ideas you have. \n\n- New Background Pattern Options -\nYou can now adjust the opacity of background patterns and choose between small or large scale.\n\n- New Isometric Background Pattern -\nIf you feel passionately about angles, you know what we’re talking about.\n\n- Improved Scrubber -\nThe scrubber for navigating your document now hides along with other interface elements when in fullscreen mode.\n\nIt also now hides when zooming your document so there is less chance of bumping it.\n\n- Lasso Knife Enhancement -\nThe Lasso Knife now places your selection when you tap another tool (thanks for pointing this out Guilherme!).

Introducing the new Lasso Knife tool, a powerful new way to create with Flow.\n\n- Move and rotate -\nWith the Lasso Knife you can trace around parts of your drawing that you want to select and edit. The selected strokes lift off the page, you can move them by dragging around and tap to place them back down. When you have something selected you can also use two fingers to rotate.\n\n- Duplicate -\nYou can copy anything you have selected by tapping the duplicate button on the tool editor. If you are using an Apple Pencil you can also press and hold a finger down then drag with the Pencil to create a copy.\n\n- Select by pen type -\nThe Lasso Knife allows you to choose what kind of pen strokes it selects from the page. You can toggle each option from the tool editor when the Lasso Knife is your active tool. This is super handy when you want to edit just one part of your drawing, for example you can select just the graphite pencil lines from a sketch you’ve drawn over top of with a fineliner pen. \n\n- Recolor -\nYou can change the color of any strokes you have selected, just press on the recolor icon and drag over your page or pens to get a new color. This feature becomes extra powerful when combined with selecting by pen type - for example you can select just the chisel marker shading on your drawing and modify its color. \n\n\nWe are working around the clock to update and improve Flow.
