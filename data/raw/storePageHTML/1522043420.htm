      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I think this is a great app from a design perspective. Unfortunately there are too many bugs or things that just don’t work right.<br /><br />Links often don’t match what they should, and sometimes you can watch the link change in the tweet to something unrelated right before your eyes. Very odd. You may tap a link and get something completely different.<br /><br />If you share a tweet through iMessage, more often than not the tweet doesn’t actually share, it just sends a blank message.<br /><br />I can’t figure out how to view the tweet that is being retweeted. Sometimes I can tap on it and it takes me to that tweet, sometimes absolutely nothing happens. Same thing for tweets in the timeline. Sometimes tapping on a tweet takes me to a completely different tweet.<br /><br />And the thing that is most infuriating, when you open the app, it shows the tweets you were viewing last time, not the newest tweets. On the iPad, tapping the “Feed” tab takes you to the top, but this doesn’t work on the iPhone. You have to tap the top of the screen.<br /><br />Great idea for an app, but it really doesn’t work as it should. Hopefully over time it will mature. But, this was released before it was ready, leaving us paying customers as beta testers.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been using Aviary as my main Twitter app for some time now, and I grew to fall in love with it. The UI which reminds me of Apollo is part of the reason why I use it as my main Twitter app the other part is just how fluid and clean the app looks from the app icon to the app itself it shows how much the developer cared about the design of the app and to make it as if Apple created the app itself! While it’s not perfect I do have issue trying to use the app on my Apple Watch Series 3 where it won’t let me log in and they’re still some things I would love to see added in future builds assuming the Twitter API allows it, but at the end of the day I plan on keeping with Aviary for all my Twitter needs and can’t wait to see where it’ll be a year from now!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I purchased this app with hopes of replacing TweetBot but unfortunately failed to replace it.<br />This app works great while it works but sometimes fails to refresh the timeline (which can be ‘fixed’ by completely restarting the app), spontaneously restarts the in-line video playback in the middle (and sometimes locks up itself in the video preview interface, with no response to the touch, keyboard input), does not sync timeline position with other iOS/macOS devices, displays wrong picture (or link) when the preview is touched in the timeline.<br />The app does get many bug fixes and features updates (sometimes multiple times a day), but I decided to use the other app while the bugs are polished here.<br />Developer, please fix critical bugs before implementing more features.</p>

Unfortunately there are too many bugs or things that just don’t work right.\n\nLinks often don’t match what they should, and sometimes you can watch the link change in the tweet to something unrelated right before your eyes. Very odd. You may tap a link and get something completely different.\n\nIf you share a tweet through iMessage, more often than not the tweet doesn’t actually share, it just sends a blank message.\n\nI can’t figure out how to view the tweet that is being retweeted. Sometimes I can tap on it and it takes me to that tweet, sometimes absolutely nothing happens. Same thing for tweets in the timeline. Sometimes tapping on a tweet takes me to a completely different tweet.\n\nAnd the thing that is most infuriating, when you open the app, it shows the tweets you were viewing last time, not the newest tweets. On the iPad, tapping the “Feed” tab takes you to the top, but this doesn’t work on the iPhone. You have to tap the top of the screen.\n\nGreat idea for an app, but it really doesn’t work as it should. Hopefully over time it will mature.

I have to type the entire user name every single time.\n• Can’t long-press any links to copy the URL.\n• Tapping a linked tweet “preview” opens details for the tweet of the account I follow, not the tweet that person linked to.\n• Undoing a retweet is strangely rather difficult.\n\nPS: we don’t need or want four updates in a day.

The first being that the Apple Watch app was stuck on the “open the app on your iPhone” screen and no matter what I did, including reinstalling the app, I couldn’t get it to go away. \n\nThe second was spending the last 18ish hours dealing with phantom audio coming out of both my iPhone and iPad. It was super creepy, and a little bit ago I finally figured out that it was coming from the app when I opened it to check Twitter and it started doing it again. I closed it and the audio stopped, then I opened it and the audio started playing again. \n\nThese issues aside, I like the UI and I think eventually I could end up using it more than Tweetbot. Just isn’t quite there yet.","title":"Good app but pretty buggy","userName":"Makaveli28"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7030611229","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-23T22:40:50Z","rating":5,"review":"I’ll leave my initial review down below, but I stuck with it, and the developer has really improved the app. Widgets are working great. I don’t really use it for most of the other features, I mainly use the widget on my home screen and select it when a new tweet arrives. Does what I want it to do. \n\nThis app tries to do waaay too much. All I want is to see my feed in a widget, and it can’t do that—telling me to open the app and i can see my feed. The app is open, nothing is showing up. I’ve tried restarting my phone, reinstalling the app, logging in again to my Twitter feed, nada.

I find myself spending more time switching back to Twitter’s app than actually having a pleasant viewing experience with Aviary. The biggest issues are threads not properly populating replies and reply tweets not referencing context.\n\nI am a huge fan of Apollo for Reddit and this app was definitely inspired by it. However, UX is day and night when comparing the two. 3 stars because this app was built with passion, but currently lacks the stability to replace other twitter clients. Aviary is still in very active development, so I will keep a close eye on it. Rating will be updated when app works the way it should.","title":"Not Ready For Prime Time","userName":"msobes"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6781809756","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-12-22T16:43:36Z","rating":3,"review":"I’ve used Tweetbot for years, as I felt it was the best visible Twitter experience. That is, until Aviary came along. I love how it looks on the ipad with the different columns. That being said, as other reviewers have noted, the app is unfortunately very buggy. Quite often, searches on Twitter lead to no results. Or, for example, I click on a post and none of the replies come up. In addition, there are plenty of links that don’t work when you click on them. I know it’s not a link issue because when i go to Tweetbot, they work. \n\nSo, if you want reliability and full use of Twitter, for now, look elsewhere. However, if you want the best Twitter experience on the ipad, look no further.","title":"Nice design, lots of bugs","userName":"Un
