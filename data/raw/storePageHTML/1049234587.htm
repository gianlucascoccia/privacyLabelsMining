      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I absolutely love this stupid app. It’s got me excited to go to the gym and setting up a schedule and I’ve never had that before. I don’t use the meal planner because I’m a poor college student, so I don’t do much grocery shopping, but the option is there and I really like the meals it offers. <br /><br />There are a few things I would change, but the pros so outweigh the cons that they’re easy to pass over when deciding between 4 or 5 stars. One, I wish that it gave you the option to change the default warm up setting. Sometimes I forget to change it and it jumps right into the workout and I don’t want that. Also, as someone else said, the mile tracker is wayyy off, but I’m not super concerned with miles right now, I’m just trying to build a cardio base, and I could always just use another app. Lastly, all the tapping is annoying at times, but so sometimes I just don’t do it. I just remember what exercise is coming next and I do it. For the supersets I just use the clock at the top to count my 30 seconds. <br /><br />Overall, such a good app. I can’t keep the subscription going because, like I said, poor college student and I’m trying to afford a trip to Japan this summer, but holy cow I’m still debating paying for it. I really do love this app. The workout counter keeps me motivated and on track and the workouts are so much fun. I’m really seeing changes and I’m really happy. Thanks Sweat Team!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love this app so much! This is an amazing way to work out. I started working out with Sweat since end of February. It’s very smart and very convenient and you can work out at the gym or at home. There are tons of different programs you can choose within Sweat that suits your current condition and goals. I never liked working out but with this app I became obsessed. What I love the most about it is the instructors that I can find on Instagram. The connection makes me feel that there is a real person who is leading me through this. When I said it’s convenient, I meant it 100%. So first of all, if you work out at the gym, they built it the way you can find everything you need for each activation in one place. You watch a short video for each exercise which is showing you how to do it. You don’t have to run from one machine to another with no break in between. They thought of the adequate breaks in between each activation set. Also I love the built-in timers within timers. I am telling you, it makes it so much easier to do it right. I tried a couple more apps before and my experience wasn’t as efficient, pleasant and great as with Sweat. Amazing work, guys! Honestly, my life has changed since this app. Since I am hooked to consistently working out now, I became more fit, confident, healthier, and just more positive!!! Thank you!</p>

We will be clear and transparent about the information we are collecting and what we will do with that information or data.\n\nThis Policy sets out the following:\nWhat personal data we collect and process about you in connection with your relationship with us as a customer and through your use of our website, apps, mobile applications, and online services;\nWhere we obtain the data from;\nWhat we do with that data;\nHow we store the data;\nThe persons to which we transfer or disclose personal data;\nHow we deal with your data protection rights;\nHow we comply with the data protection rules.\nThat personal data is collected and processed in accordance with applicable data protection laws.\n\nData Controller\n“Bikini Body” (referred to as “we”, “us”, “our” or “Bikini Body”) in this policy primarily refers to The Bikini Body Training Company Pty Ltd, the main operating company of the Bikini Body group, and, where appropriate, to other companies in the Bikini Body group or other entities over which Bikini Body exercises management control. Bikini Body is the “data controller” of all personal data that is collected and used about Bikini Body customers for the purposes of privacy and data protection laws, principles and regulations which may apply in your country.\n\nWhat personal data we collect\nPersonal data means any information relating to you which allows us to identify you, such as your name, phone number, social media name or ‘handle’, postal address, email address, details of products or services you have purchased, payment details and information about your access to our website.\nWe may collect personal data from you (either directly or indirectly, through our third party partners or providers) in a number of ways.\nSpecifically, we may collect the following categories of personal data:\nName, home address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit/debit card or other payment details;\nInformation such as nationality, place and date of birth, and gender;\nMedical conditions or requirements, and dietary preferences;\nInformation you provide about yourself and any preferences in your account;\nInformation about your purchases of products and services from us or our partners;\nInformation about your use of our website or app;\nCommunications with us or directed to us via letters, emails, chat services, calls, and social media; and\nLocation, including real-time geographic location of your computer or device through GPS, Bluetooth and your IP address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell-tower locations, but only if you use location-based features and turn on the location services settings on your device or computer.\nPersonal details including about your physical or mental health are considered “sensitive” personal data under applicable data protection laws. We will process any such data only if you have given your explicit consent, or it is necessary (for instance if you request special assistance), or you have deliberately made it public.\n\nWhat do we use your personal data for, why, and for how long\nYour data may be used for the following purposes:\nProvide products and services you request: we use the information you give us to perform the services for which you have signed up;\nCredit or other payment card verification/screening; and payment information for accounting, billing and audit purposes and to detect or prevent any fraudulent activities;\nAdministrative or legal purposes: we use your data for statistical and marketing analysis, systems testing, customer surveys, maintenance and development, or in order to deal with a dispute or claim. We may perform data profiling based on the data we collect from you for statistical and marketing analysis purposes, but only with your prior consent, and by making best endeavours to ensure that all data it is based on is accurate. By providing any personal data you explicitly agree that we may use it to perform profiling activities in accordance with this privacy policy;\nSecurity, health, administrative, crime prevention/detection: we may pass your information to government authorities or enforcement bodies for compliance with legal requirements;\nCustomer service communications: we use your data to manage our relationship with you as our customer and to improve our services and enhance your experience with us;\nProvide tailored services: we use your data to provide information we believe is of interest to you, prior to, during, and after your interactions with us, and to personalise the services we offer to you, such as special offers.\nWe will only process your personal data where we have a legal basis to do so, which will depend on the reasons for which we have collected and need to use your personal data.\nIn most cases we will need to process your personal data so that we can enter into our contract and fulfil the provision or delivery of goods or services to you.\n\nWe may also process your personal data for one or more of the following:\nTo comply with a legal obligation;\nWhere you have consented to our using your personal data (eg. for marketing related uses);\nTo protect your vital interests or those of another person (eg. in case of a medical emergency);\nIf it is in our legitimate interests to do so (eg. for administrative purposes).\nOnly children above a certain age (generally 16 years or older, but varying from country to country) can provide their own consent. For children under this age, the knowledge and consent of the parents or legal guardians is required.\nWe will not retain your data for longer than is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it is being processed. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the purposes for which we process it, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.\nWe also consider the periods for which we might need to retain personal data in order to meet our legal obligations, or to deal with complaints and queries, and to protect our legal rights in the event of a claim being made.\nWhen we no longer need your personal data, we will securely delete or destroy it. We will also consider if and how we can minimise over time the personal data that we use, and if we can anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you or identify you, in which case we may use that information without further notice to you.\n\nSecurity of your personal data\nWe follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your personal data, and to protect it against accidental loss, destruction or damage. The data you provide to us is protected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology. SSL is the industry standard method of encrypting personal information and credit card details so that they can be securely transferred over the Internet.\n\nSharing your personal data\nYour personal data may be shared with other companies within the Bikini Body group.\nWe may also share your personal data with the following third parties for the purpose described in this privacy policy:\nGovernment authorities, law enforcement bodies and regulators for compliance with legal requirements;\nOther companies, contractors or agents to provide services to you including delivery, marketing, support ticket providers (which may include Zendesk), or marketing platform providers (which may include Emarsys), communications, legal services, debt collection, administration services, customer services, information technology providers, credit card or other payment methods to conduct transactions;\nThe host of our online store (Shopify Inc.), which provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you. Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases, and the general Shopify application. By using services provided by Shopify Inc. you agree to their terms and conditions, which are available at https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms, including their privacy policy;\nCredit and debit card companies which facilitate your payments to us, and for anti-fraud screening, which may need information about your method of payment to process payment or ensure the security of your payment transaction. These may include third party payment gateway providers, including at www.stripe.com or www.paypal.com or www.apple.com. Before entering your personal details we suggest that you read and become familiar with the privacy policy for any such third-party provider;\nLegal and other professional advisers, law courts and law enforcement bodies in countries in which we operate, in order to enforce our legal rights in relation to our contract with you;\nOur trusted third party ancillary partners (identified on our website), who many offer products and services on or through our website. If you choose to purchase products or services offered on our websites by third parties, you may be a customer of both Bikini Body and these third parties, and we and our partners may collect and share information about you, such as your contact details and your billing information. We are not responsible for third parties’ use of your personal data where such use is permitted for their own purposes. You should consult their privacy policies for further information.\nSocial media: You may be able to access third party social media services through our website or app or before coming to our website or app. When you are registered with your social media account, we will obtain the personal data you choose to share with us through these social media services pursuant to their privacy settings in order to improve and personalize your use of our website or app. We may also use social media plugins on our website or app. As a result your information will be shared with your social media provider and possibly presented on your social media profile to be shared with others in your network. Please refer to the privacy policy of those third-party social media providers to find out more about these practices.\n\nInternational Data Transfer\nBikini Body operates businesses in multiple jurisdictions, some of which are not located in the European Union or European Economic Area (EEA). While countries outside the EEA do not always have strong data protection laws, we require all services providers to process your information in a secure manner and in accordance with EU and other applicable laws on privacy and data protection.\n\nCookies and site tracking\nWe may collect data from other sources which may not always be obvious, such as through the use of “cookies”. We may also gather information from both online and offline data providers. This information could include internet browsing behaviour, demographic data or interest-based data.\nA cookie is a small text file stored on your computer that contains information that helps the website to identify and track the visitor.

Bikini Body is the “data controller” of all personal data that is collected and used about Bikini Body customers for the purposes of privacy and data protection laws, principles and regulations which may apply in your country.\n\nWhat personal data we collect\nPersonal data means any information relating to you which allows us to identify you, such as your name, phone number, social media name or ‘handle’, postal address, email address, details of products or services you have purchased, payment details and information about your access to our website.\nWe may collect personal data from you (either directly or indirectly, through our third party partners or providers) in a number of ways.\nSpecifically, we may collect the following categories of personal data:\nName, home address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit/debit card or other payment details;\nInformation such as nationality, place and date of birth, and gender;\nMedical conditions or requirements, and dietary preferences;\nInformation you provide about yourself and any preferences in your account;\nInformation about your purchases of products and services from us or our partners;\nInformation about your use of our website or app;\nCommunications with us or directed to us via letters, emails, chat services, calls, and social media; and\nLocation, including real-time geographic location of your computer or device through GPS, Bluetooth and your IP address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell-tower locations, but only if you use location-based features and turn on the location services settings on your device or computer.\nPersonal details including about your physical or mental health are considered “sensitive” personal data under applicable data protection laws. We will process any such data only if you have given your explicit consent, or it is necessary (for instance if you request special assistance), or you have deliberately made it public.\n\nWhat do we use your personal data for, why, and for how long\nYour data may be used for the following purposes:\nProvide products and services you request: we use the information you give us to perform the services for which you have signed up;\nCredit or other payment card verification/screening; and payment information for accounting, billing and audit purposes and to detect or prevent any fraudulent activities;\nAdministrative or legal purposes: we use your data for statistical and marketing analysis, systems testing, customer surveys, maintenance and development, or in order to deal with a dispute or claim. We may perform data profiling based on the data we collect from you for statistical and marketing analysis purposes, but only with your prior consent, and by making best endeavours to ensure that all data it is based on is accurate. By providing any personal data you explicitly agree that we may use it to perform profiling activities in accordance with this privacy policy;\nSecurity, health, administrative, crime prevention/detection: we may pass your information to government authorities or enforcement bodies for compliance with legal requirements;\nCustomer service communications: we use your data to manage our relationship with you as our customer and to improve our services and enhance your experience with us;\nProvide tailored services: we use your data to provide information we believe is of interest to you, prior to, during, and after your interactions with us, and to personalise the services we offer to you, such as special offers.\nWe will only process your personal data where we have a legal basis to do so, which will depend on the reasons for which we have collected and need to use your personal data.\nIn most cases we will need to process your personal data so that we can enter into our contract and fulfil the provision or delivery of goods or services to you.\n\nWe may also process your personal data for one or more of the following:\nTo comply with a legal obligation;\nWhere you have consented to our using your personal data (eg. for marketing related uses);\nTo protect your vital interests or those of another person (eg. in case of a medical emergency);\nIf it is in our legitimate interests to do so (eg. for administrative purposes).\nOnly children above a certain age (generally 16 years or older, but varying from country to country) can provide their own consent. For children under this age, the knowledge and consent of the parents or legal guardians is required.\nWe will not retain your data for longer than is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it is being processed. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the purposes for which we process it, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.\nWe also consider the periods for which we might need to retain personal data in order to meet our legal obligations, or to deal with complaints and queries, and to protect our legal rights in the event of a claim being made.\nWhen we no longer need your personal data, we will securely delete or destroy it. We will also consider if and how we can minimise over time the personal data that we use, and if we can anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you or identify you, in which case we may use that information without further notice to you.\n\nSecurity of your personal data\nWe follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your personal data, and to protect it against accidental loss, destruction or damage. The data you provide to us is protected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology. SSL is the industry standard method of encrypting personal information and credit card details so that they can be securely transferred over the Internet.\n\nSharing your personal data\nYour personal data may be shared with other companies within the Bikini Body group.\nWe may also share your personal data with the following third parties for the purpose described in this privacy policy:\nGovernment authorities, law enforcement bodies and regulators for compliance with legal requirements;\nOther companies, contractors or agents to provide services to you including delivery, marketing, support ticket providers (which may include Zendesk), or marketing platform providers (which may include Emarsys), communications, legal services, debt collection, administration services, customer services, information technology providers, credit card or other payment methods to conduct transactions;\nThe host of our online store (Shopify Inc.), which provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you.

This software does not enable us to capture any of your data.\nYour personal information will not be shared, sold, rented or disclosed other than as described in this privacy policy.\n\nData Protection Officer\nWe have appointed a Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) to oversee compliance with this policy. You have the right to make a complaint at any time to a supervisory authority. The data protection supervisory authority for you depends upon the country or geographical area in which you are located.\n\nYour Data Protection Rights\nUnder certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:\nRequest information about whether we hold personal information about you, and, if so, what that information is and why we are holding/using it.\nRequest access to your personal information (commonly known as a \"data subject access request\"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\nRequest correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.\nRequest erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see e. below).\nObject to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.\nObject to automated decision-making including profiling, that is not to be subject of any automated decision-making by us using your personal information or profiling of you.\nRequest the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.\nRequest transfer of your personal information in an electronic and structured form to you or to another party (commonly known as a right to “data portability”). This enables you to take your data from us in an electronically useable format and to be able to transfer your data to another party in an electronically useable format.\nWithdraw consent. In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes to which you originally agreed, unless we have another proper and legitimate basis for doing so.\nIf you want to exercise any of these rights, then please contact our DPO by email at dataprotection@sweat.com. Alternatively, if you are an Australian resident you can also contact our Privacy Compliance Officer at the same email address: dataprotection@sweat.com.\nYou will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly completely unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.\nWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\n\nChanges to Privacy Policy\nOur privacy policy may change from time to time. Any changes will be communicated to you by way of an e-mail or a notice on our website.","editorialNotes":{"standard":"Fitness expert Kayla Itsines wants you to reach all your health and exercise goals—and her amazing app has just what you need to get there.

I don’t use the meal planner because I’m a poor college student, so I don’t do much grocery shopping, but the option is there and I really like the meals it offers. \n\nThere are a few things I would change, but the pros so outweigh the cons that they’re easy to pass over when deciding between 4 or 5 stars. One, I wish that it gave you the option to change the default warm up setting. Sometimes I forget to change it and it jumps right into the workout and I don’t want that. Also, as someone else said, the mile tracker is wayyy off, but I’m not super concerned with miles right now, I’m just trying to build a cardio base, and I could always just use another app. Lastly, all the tapping is annoying at times, but so sometimes I just don’t do it. I just remember what exercise is coming next and I do it. For the supersets I just use the clock at the top to count my 30 seconds. \n\nOverall, such a good app. I can’t keep the subscription going because, like I said, poor college student and I’m trying to afford a trip to Japan this summer, but holy cow I’m still debating paying for it. I really do love this app. The workout counter keeps me motivated and on track and the workouts are so much fun. I’m really seeing changes and I’m really happy.

This is an amazing way to work out. I started working out with Sweat since end of February. It’s very smart and very convenient and you can work out at the gym or at home. There are tons of different programs you can choose within Sweat that suits your current condition and goals. I never liked working out but with this app I became obsessed. What I love the most about it is the instructors that I can find on Instagram. The connection makes me feel that there is a real person who is leading me through this. When I said it’s convenient, I meant it 100%. So first of all, if you work out at the gym, they built it the way you can find everything you need for each activation in one place. You watch a short video for each exercise which is showing you how to do it. You don’t have to run from one machine to another with no break in between. They thought of the adequate breaks in between each activation set. Also I love the built-in timers within timers. I am telling you, it makes it so much easier to do it right. I tried a couple more apps before and my experience wasn’t as efficient, pleasant and great as with Sweat. Amazing work, guys! Honestly, my life has changed since this app. Since I am hooked to consistently working out now, I became more fit, confident, healthier, and just more positive!!!

After only three weeks of training I’m already seeing results! One issue I have with the app is you have to keep it open for your entire workout which totally drains my phone’s battery. It would be great to have an option to flow through the circuits without having to pause and press on an arrow, which stumps my motivation as I’m pushing through the last few reps of one exercise and starting the next. You also have to keep the app open during your entire cardio workout (ESPECIALLY during HIIT days) and doesn’t voice how far you’ve gone, when you’re done, or for HIIT, when to work/rest unless you’re looking at your screen. This is just my opinion as I don’t like being very hands-on with my phone when I’m dripping with sweat! 😜 The last issue I have is with the mile tracking. I’ll have both mapmyrun and sweat open at the same time and sweat will have twice the mileage I actually ran on mapmyrun. Like I said before, this app is really awesome but with a few tweaks, could be absolutely incredible!","title":"Great app but needs work","userName":"KHavey"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5881235925","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-29T23:13:15Z","rating":5,"review":"I love this app because like allot of people, I’m really bad motivating myself while I’m in the gym. Two factors; I like my own specific Dj sets to listen to which I’m so glad I can still listen while using the app, but I also prefer someone telling me what to do and timing me or giving me rep count so I don’t have to look at a freaking notebook or scroll through my phone to find some article with a workout plan thus just wasting time and spending even more time in the gym. This app just makes the process easy to understand and keep motivation through out as it literally walks you through step by step. So if you’re worried about your phone being on the entire time then just keep in mind you might need this app for the motivation, time management, and seeing the movement itself for proper form (as not everyone knows what every exercise looks like. For example did you know a proper squat needs you to focus on pushing your knees out? I see so many people letting their knees buckle in and then wonder why their back and rest of the body hurts from misalignment.) So just shut your phone off if you’re doing cardio, you can always go back and mark it as complete. \n\nThe food options are amazing and so easy to make, no excuses on “I don’t have time” !

The workouts are amazing, they have great beginner options, but I went into it at an intermediate level and they're killer! They are tough, but I've found that my strength and confidence has grown tremendously from doing BBG and trying several workouts from the other programs, which is another thing I love about this app. The variety in programs make it suitable for any kind of workout goal. I can see how the intensity and difficulty of BBG might be unmotivating for some though, so it's great that Kayla has recently added more beginner weeks! he community tab is filled with supportive women! The only thing I've never used and probably will never use is the meal plan because there is just a way too many different ingredients and meals (which might be a good thing for other people, but for a broke student, I'm not really looking to buy a full-sized product or unit of produce to use only 1/2 a slice of and then not use for any other meals in the week.) The app has some bugs sometimes but Sweat team replies fast and takes suggestions! My only wish is that it was better compatible with the Apple Watch which is one of the reasons I got the app in the first place, because I saw it could pair to my watch.","title":"changing my life","userName":"Hxnxlei"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3029805453","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-08-07T09:49:38Z","developerResponse":{"id":9371977,"body":"Thank you so much for your review.

Let me start by saying I was already in good shape, particularly aerobic wise. I downloaded the app to see if I could use it in place of my expensive gym membership.  I also wanted to tone up a bit more. This app puts me through my paces! I love how flexible it is and how the workouts are only 28 minutes each. I’m a busy teacher and mom of six-year-old twins so it needs to work around my life. I can fit in a 28-minute workout in the morning or after they’re in bed. After only a week, I’m feeling more toned already. I’m not following the eating plan because I already track macros and calories. So far, I love it! I can’t wait to see my progress pics in three weeks.\n\nUpdate 8/7/18: I’m now on Week 19 (+4 of Beginner). While I haven’t been perfect, this program has gotten me into the best shape of my life. I was always fit aerobically. However, I couldn’t do burpees and push-ups to save my life. Now I can!! They’re not perfect but I can knock out 15-20 or each in a row. \nI love that the program fits around my busy life and I can even take it traveling. So happy I found this app!! \nI would like it better if I could add friends so we could challenge each other and track each other’s fitness.","title":"Puts this gym rat through her paces","userName":"Bekkilli"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5936934066","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-05-12T19:14:22Z","rating":5,"review":"Go for it! Definitely worth the subscription if you think you’re worth a better YOU! I’ve tried other workout apps, but SWEAT is the first one I’ve stuck with for almost two years now. Why? The workouts REALLY work, it TRULY is a mind-changer! About six months in, I realized I had reached an amazing milestone for me - without paying much attention to the scale (I don’t even own one), I’d dropped a size in jeans and now am a new “normal” body size. More important to me, I am consistently STRONGER, and most important to me, I am consistently in a better mental state. \nAbout the app itself: When I had access to a gym, I loved following Kelsey Wells’ gym workouts — they’re challenging, safe on your own, \u0026 fun! Now that we’re all stuck at home (it’s May 2020), I really am grateful for Kayla Itsines’ workouts because I can easily do them with minimal equipment. I know Kelsey also has an at home workout, I just haven’t even tried it yet. \nI SUPER love following Kelsey Wells on Instagram for her body-positive and self-love posts, as well as Kayla Itsines’ amazing food ideas. I’ve tried workouts from the other trainers as well (glute challenge FTW!). They’re all so good, I’ve made a good friend at the gym because of SWEAT, I have gotten my mom hooked on it — I can’t say enough!!","title":"The SWEAT app fits ANY lifestyle!","userName":"TortoiseRunner"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3755581867","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-02-10T22:21:38Z","rating":5,"review":"After having my second baby my weight has been a big concern for me, and cardio was very hard because I was breast feeding and I don’t really like running. So, I found sweat. This app was my life change. I got back in shape before my maternity leave expired (with a diet of course). When I got back to work I kind of gave up on working out and I felt guilty about it. But luckily sweat promoted the 12 week challenge and I knew this is the time for me to get back on track so now I don’t miss my workouts and instead of running on a treadmill when the weather is nice I take looong walks with my kids. I don’t do a lot of cardio but I do the daily workouts.  I definitely recommend this app,  but if you think you won’t be consistent don’t even think starting because you’ll blame the program not yourself. I believe that any workout is good if you’re consistent. If working out is new for you and you don’t know where to start I think sweat is a good start. I have my sisters and my friend on sweat now and we make sure to post our work outs and keep accountable each other, which is fun:) if you want to feel better and look better, then this is for you, too ✊🏋️‍♀️🏆","title":"Just be consistent and the reward will come sooner than you think!","userName":"DFGN 1803"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3838051739","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-03-03T16:38:11Z","developerResponse":{"id":9372049,"body":"We really appreciate your feedback.

I prefer to watch a show or videos when I do cardio so it was kind of annoying that I couldn’t. Also, the app crashed several times when I was in the middle of a weight training workout and when I re-opened the app all my progress was lost so the only option was to re-start the workout, again, super annoying when you’re more than halfway through the workout! Also, there is no option to swap out an exercise for something low impact. I have an injury that prevents me from doing any type of jumping and I had to research alternatives for jumping jacks, mountain climbers, etc. on my own because the app didn’t provide any guidance. And my least favorite thing about the app is that you can’t skip a specific set and come back to it. My gym is relatively busy with limited weight equipment and there were times where I had to wait almost 20 min to do a set because the app wouldn’t let me skip and come back to it.\n\nOverall, I like the concept of this app and enjoyed the weekly calendar and the exercises, but I found a lot of flaws that I couldn’t look past and annoyed me, which made using it less enjoyable. Maybe if the app was free or less than $20/month I would have stuck with it!","title":"Could be a lot better","userName":"meg4eva"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4019601325","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-04-16T11:25:25Z","developerResponse":{"id":9372085,"body":"Fantastic!

I have been using this since the fall to get in shape for my wedding and I can’t wait to show off the results in my low back dress! I actually look forward to going to the gym and enjoy every part of my workout (even when it is tough!) Kelsey’s program is awesome because it changes every week so you never get bored. The gym equipment portions are great and accessible for those who don’t feel as confident using them. The flexibility between programs is also perfect for me with a busy schedule. Sometimes if I can’t make it to the gym I will do a Kayla Itsines BBG workout at home, and be sore for about a week after!! I am also really excited that Kelsey has come out with a home workout program as well!\n\n The one thing I would change about the app is on Monday’s it automatically changes what week you are on and you have to manually go back and change it if you weren’t finished with that particular week. I like to finish all the workouts in each week before i move on, but most of the time I only can get to the gym three to four times a week so it is hard to complete all the workouts in that time.
