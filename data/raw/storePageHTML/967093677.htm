      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app is pretty good for watching shows that can be found on the tv channels, but there’s a few glitches that bother me. <br />The ads are fine in my opinion, I mean like how else they gonna keep the app free, right?<br />But these glitches make it so I can’t even watch what I want to. I was in the middle of watching, and the ads come on, like they always do, and I paused it for a minute to go do something, I come back and my iPad screen had turned off, so I turned it back on and when I tried to unpause it, it unpaused for like 2 seconds, then the ads stopped playing and the screen went black. I could tap the screen and the buttons would come up, play/pause, done etc, but when I tried to make it play it wouldn’t. I tried countless times, restarting the app, waiting some, resetting where I was, rewatching the episode until that set of ads, nothing has worked. Every time I got to that particular set of ads, the app just seemed to stop working completely, and crash.<br />Another one is sometimes, if I pause or go out of the app during the ads, when I come back the play button doesn’t work, however, just restarting the app fixes this one.<br /><br />If this is fixed, or I find a fix for this issue, I’ll edit this. However for now staying with 3 stars at the moment.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The big strongpoint of this app is that you can watch the shows with it. For an app to do what it is primarily designed for is expected. The worst flaw of this app is that in order to watch a show using AirPlay you need to turn off Auto-Lock in display settings. I have no idea how this hasn’t been fixed. I turn off Auto-Lock to watch shows with my Apple TV and then turn it back on when I am finished. This should be easily fixable with an update. Several people write off that bugs like this are to be expected because it’s a free app. I don’t feel it’s at all free with the number of ads I have to view when watching shows through the app. Someone is getting the ad revenue. I’m just stating that I would be more inclined to watch more if they fixed this feature.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Great app in terms of the number of shows. So far on the TV series I am viewing, adverts come at reasonable intervals, much like live commercial television. What confounds me is finding a watch list or favorite show list and sending feedback. I also had the devil of a time figuring out how to enable closed captioning (fortunately for me, so did many, many others, so that answer appears in the Q&amp;A). The “settings” do not have user tools. When I watch an episode of a series, I don’t see a way to either halt autoplay of the next or return to the series’ page.<br /><br />Would be nice for this app to display a few of the standard features other free streaming services provide that allows viewers to customize their experience.</p>

To help protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the collection and use of the personally identifiable information collected on our online and mobile websites, services, and applications (“Site” or “Sites”). By using the Sites, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your personal information as described in this notice.\nFor certain offerings on our Sites, there may be additional notices about information practices and choices. Please read those additional privacy disclosures to understand how they apply to you. \nTHE INFORMATION WE COLLECT\nRegistration and account information. At some Sites, you can order products, play games, read and submit reviews, enter contests, vote in polls, view and rate videos, TV shows and other content, or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that you provide as part of your account may include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card and billing information, information about your interest in and use of various content, products, programs, and services, and other information that you provide to us.  In the course of using our Sites, we may ask you to create an account or register for an application by providing us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you, as well as to administer your account.\nInformation about others/inviting friends. At some of our Sites, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to share content or recommendations, send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people as part of this process include recipient's name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and information about the recipient’s interest in and use of various content, products, programs, and services. \nSome of our Sites also allow you to invite your friends to join our services and to connect with you through social media features. Inviting friends is always optional. To do so, you may provide their contact information or may enter your log-in credentials to import e-mail addresses or usernames from your address book from other sites that support such functionality (e.g., Yahoo!, Gmail, Facebook). You select the friends you want to invite to share in this experience.\nInformation from other sources. We may, on occasion, combine information we receive online with outside records and use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, such as to enhance our ability to market to you products or services that may be of interest to you. \nSocial media. You can also engage with our content and other offerings, such as videos, contests, games and activities, on or through third-party social media sites, plug-ins and applications, such as those offered by Facebook and others. You may also choose to link your account with us to third party social media sites. When you link your account or engage with our content on or through third party social media sites, services, plug-ins, or applications you may allow us to have ongoing access to certain information from your social media account (e.g., name, e-mail address, profile photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends and their contact information, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the 'likes' you make). We may also receive non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on, etc.) from your interaction with our content. \nWhen you provide information to a Site from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (i) give you exclusive content, (ii) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Sites, and (iii) contact you through the social media sites or directly with the latest news, special offerings, and rewards. By providing such information, you consent to the use of the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. \nIf you post information or content, such as by posting photos, commenting on a blog, or participating in chat functions or online forums or communities at our Sites, or when you interact with our Sites through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, depending on your privacy settings, this information may become public on the Internet. Therefore, we cannot prevent further use of this information. You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. For more information about how you can customize your privacy settings and how third party social media sites handle your personally identifiable information, please refer to their privacy help guides, privacy policies and terms of use.\nInformation collection from mobile devices. If you access our Sites, on your mobile telephone or other mobile device, we also may collect your unique device identifier and mobile device IP address (e.g. MAC address), as well as information about your device’s operating system, mobile carrier, and mobile Internet browsers, your precise location information, and other information described in this Policy. \nTechnical and usage information. We also collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you use our Sites, including when you view content and videos on our Sites, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows, Mac OS, iOS, and Android), the domain name of your Internet service provider or mobile carrier, IP address, device ID and other technical attributes related to your device, and certain usage information.  For example, some content on our Sites is limited to users in the United States and the US territories. Your device IP address is tested by the Site so that The CW can determine whether you are located in the United States or the US territories.\nProviding requested information. In some cases, only persons who provide us with the requested  information will be able to order products, programs, and services, or otherwise participate in the Site's activities and offerings. \nHOW WE USE THE INFORMATION\nProviding our products and services.

We and our agents, contractors, and service providers may disclose information we maintain when required to do so by applicable US or other law, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, legal process, or other claim or inquiry. We also may disclose such information in response to a US or other law enforcement agency’s request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, and to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Sites and applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by US or other law or legal requirements. In addition, we may transfer information about our visitors in the event of a business transaction or reorganization, such as if we or one of our business units or our relevant assets are reorganized, acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company.\nService providers.

Entertainment is available in the WARNER BROS. AFFILIATES section below.  A list of affiliates of CBS Corporation is available at www.cbscorporation.com/portfolio.php. \nWe may also share such information with business partners and third parties (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, application developers, participatory databases and non-profit organizations) that want to market products or services to you. If we share personally identifiable information with such unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses. \nLinked sites. Some of our Sites contain links to other sites, services, and applications whose information practices may be different from ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy policies before submitting any information, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. \nSponsors, joint-offerings and co-promotions. We sometimes may offer content or programs (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications or social network integrations) that are sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information, which is covered by their own privacy policies. The Site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.\nAdvertising. At some of our Sites, reputable third parties may present or serve advertisements, provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and site analytics, and assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit, or set their own cookies. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Privacy Policy. They may also obtain information about other applications that you have downloaded to your computer or mobile device, the sites you visit, and other information about you or your computer or device in order to help analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the Site and elsewhere.

We provide you with an opportunity to express your preferences with respect to receiving certain marketing communications from us or from unaffiliated third parties.

We, and our affiliates, third party service providers, and our business partners may send \"cookies\" to your computer or use similar technologies to support and enhance your online experience at our Sites, including by helping us collect and understand usage and performance information and to display and measure advertisements. For example, \"cookies\" are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information (including click through and click stream data). Cookies manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us and/or other networks or sites. Cookies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser).\nSome of our Sites may use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as \"Flash cookies\") to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation. Adobe's Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your web browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe's website at http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html.\nWe may also use \"web beacons\" that monitor your use of our Sites. Web beacons (or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. \nWhen corresponding with you via HTML capable email, web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our email.\nOn their own, cookies or web beacons generally do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/web beacons.\nManaging cookies and web beacons and Do Not Track. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and web beacons as described herein. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Additionally, by setting your web browser to display HTML emails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some web beacons. Please consult the \"Help\" section of your browser for more information. However, certain areas of our Sites can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Site features. We do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.\nFor more information about cookies and how browser settings can be changed to reject them, you should go to your web browser’s Help menu. \nGoogle Analytics, one of our service providers, provides its own opt-out process. You can find out more information about Google Analytics’ cookies at https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies.

However, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be used or disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.\nHOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CORRECT INFORMATION \nTo access the personally identifiable information that our Sites have collected about you online from the pages on which this Privacy Policy is posted, to correct factual errors in such information, or to update your interests, preferences or other portions of your user profile, please log into your account if you have created one with us or send an email to privacy@wb.com.\nTo help protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. \nADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CHILDREN'S PRIVACY \nThis privacy policy governs Sites or portions of Sites that are directed to a general audience and that are not designed or intended for use by children.

The CW Network is a joint venture between Warner Bros. Entertainment and CBS Corporation (collectively \"we\" or \"us\"). Your privacy is important to us. To help protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the collection and use of the personally identifiable information collected on our online and mobile websites, services, and applications (“Site” or “Sites”). By using the Sites, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your personal information as described in this notice.\nFor certain offerings on our Sites, there may be additional notices about information practices and choices. Please read those additional privacy disclosures to understand how they apply to you. \nTHE INFORMATION WE COLLECT\nRegistration and account information. At some Sites, you can order products, play games, read and submit reviews, enter contests, vote in polls, view and rate videos, TV shows and other content, or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that you provide as part of your account may include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card and billing information, information about your interest in and use of various content, products, programs, and services, and other information that you provide to us.  In the course of using our Sites, we may ask you to create an account or register for an application by providing us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you, as well as to administer your account.\nInformation about others/inviting friends. At some of our Sites, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to share content or recommendations, send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people as part of this process include recipient's name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and information about the recipient’s interest in and use of various content, products, programs, and services. \nSome of our Sites also allow you to invite your friends to join our services and to connect with you through social media features. Inviting friends is always optional. To do so, you may provide their contact information or may enter your log-in credentials to import e-mail addresses or usernames from your address book from other sites that support such functionality (e.g., Yahoo!, Gmail, Facebook). You select the friends you want to invite to share in this experience.\nInformation from other sources. We may, on occasion, combine information we receive online with outside records and use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, such as to enhance our ability to market to you products or services that may be of interest to you. \nSocial media. You can also engage with our content and other offerings, such as videos, contests, games and activities, on or through third-party social media sites, plug-ins and applications, such as those offered by Facebook and others. You may also choose to link your account with us to third party social media sites. When you link your account or engage with our content on or through third party social media sites, services, plug-ins, or applications you may allow us to have ongoing access to certain information from your social media account (e.g., name, e-mail address, profile photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends and their contact information, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the 'likes' you make). We may also receive non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on, etc.) from your interaction with our content. \nWhen you provide information to a Site from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (i) give you exclusive content, (ii) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Sites, and (iii) contact you through the social media sites or directly with the latest news, special offerings, and rewards. By providing such information, you consent to the use of the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. \nIf you post information or content, such as by posting photos, commenting on a blog, or participating in chat functions or online forums or communities at our Sites, or when you interact with our Sites through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, depending on your privacy settings, this information may become public on the Internet. Therefore, we cannot prevent further use of this information. You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. For more information about how you can customize your privacy settings and how third party social media sites handle your personally identifiable information, please refer to their privacy help guides, privacy policies and terms of use.\nInformation collection from mobile devices. If you access our Sites, on your mobile telephone or other mobile device, we also may collect your unique device identifier and mobile device IP address (e.g. MAC address), as well as information about your device’s operating system, mobile carrier, and mobile Internet browsers, your precise location information, and other information described in this Policy. \nTechnical and usage information. We also collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you use our Sites, including when you view content and videos on our Sites, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows, Mac OS, iOS, and Android), the domain name of your Internet service provider or mobile carrier, IP address, device ID and other technical attributes related to your device, and certain usage information.  For example, some content on our Sites is limited to users in the United States and the US territories. Your device IP address is tested by the Site so that The CW can determine whether you are located in the United States or the US territories.\nProviding requested information. In some cases, only persons who provide us with the requested  information will be able to order products, programs, and services, or otherwise participate in the Site's activities and offerings. \nHOW WE USE THE INFORMATION\nProviding our products and services. We use the information we collect about you to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, to develop, provide, maintain, support, personalize, protect, and improve our offerings and to offer you other products, programs or services from us and our affiliates, business partners, and selected third parties that we believe may be of interest to you. \nThe information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services. \nIf you choose to submit content for publication, we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us on our Sites, the Internet, or elsewhere. \nCommunicating with you.

I was in the middle of watching, and the ads come on, like they always do, and I paused it for a minute to go do something, I come back and my iPad screen had turned off, so I turned it back on and when I tried to unpause it, it unpaused for like 2 seconds, then the ads stopped playing and the screen went black. I could tap the screen and the buttons would come up, play/pause, done etc, but when I tried to make it play it wouldn’t. I tried countless times, restarting the app, waiting some, resetting where I was, rewatching the episode until that set of ads, nothing has worked. Every time I got to that particular set of ads, the app just seemed to stop working completely, and crash.\nAnother one is sometimes, if I pause or go out of the app during the ads, when I come back the play button doesn’t work, however, just restarting the app fixes this one.\n\nIf this is fixed, or I find a fix for this issue, I’ll edit this.

I have no idea how this hasn’t been fixed. I turn off Auto-Lock to watch shows with my Apple TV and then turn it back on when I am finished. This should be easily fixable with an update. Several people write off that bugs like this are to be expected because it’s a free app. I don’t feel it’s at all free with the number of ads I have to view when watching shows through the app. Someone is getting the ad revenue.

The “settings” do not have user tools.

Must start episode over or just skip it and move along. Problems are slow to repair, no response from developers still. Could drop another star or just remove app if it doesn’t get repaired to consumer needs fo viewing.\nCC should be an option to choose, not to remove.
