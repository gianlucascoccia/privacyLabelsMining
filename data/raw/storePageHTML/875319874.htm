      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I was really excited about this app and have been a paid subscriber for a couple months.  I started to run into problems on the second month with a custom JSON widget (day density) where it isn’t showing my data for the month.<br /><br />I emailed support and they claimed it was data related.  When I proved it wasn’t they became unresponsive (not willing to admit their app has a bug nor indicating they would fix it).  <br /><br />This is how I would sum up my experience:<br /><br />- their custom JSON widgets are extremely particular (e.g. dates need to be precisely formatted and don’t handle standard ISO date formats).<br /><br />- their custom widgets are very basic and aren’t as useful if your use case doesn’t match their example.<br /><br />- their support folks aren’t very helpful or responsive.<br /><br />Overall I’m disappointed... seems like they should invest more time and development making their app and service better.</p>

Here is a brief explanation of the working of Numerics: \n\nNumerics integrates with Google Apps like Spreadsheets, Analytics, YouTube, Big Query and Gmail to bring in your key performance indicators. Since the same Google account works with all of the Google Apps, Numerics asks for permissions to all the Google Apps at once. If it asked for permissions for each of the Google Apps separately, duplicate Google accounts would have to be added, creating account clutter and confusion. Rest assured, Numerics only gets the totals and other numbers from the integrated services, that too, only when you add a widget for it on your dashboard. \n\nFurther, Numerics does a direct secure device-to-service connection, so all the widgets connect directly to the service to fetch your numbers. We do not have a server in between and do not replicate your data anywhere, except for on your device. This means, we do not have access to your usernames and passwords. All your credentials are stored securely in your device keychain. Data security and ownership is fundamentally important to us at Cynapse. Hence we've designed Numerics to directly connect to a service to aggregate, process and present dashboards on your device in real time, with no servers in the middle. This makes Numerics secure by design and more compliant with strict security policies.\n\nHope this gives you a better understanding of the working of Numerics and you will give it a try again. If you still have any concerns, please feel free to reach out via support through the app or our website and we'd be happy to help you.","modified":"2018-02-15T10:33:26Z"},"rating":2,"review":"I like the look of the advertised interface, but in order to link a google analytics account it requires access to ALL aspects of my google account including the ability to read my emails.
