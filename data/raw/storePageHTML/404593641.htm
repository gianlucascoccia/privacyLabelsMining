      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I lately have been googling new episodes from my favorite show, Unikitty, it said there was over 80 episodes. But from what I have seen, your app only includes: 5 episodes in season three, 6 episodes in season two, and 5 episodes in season one. I’m wondering where the episodes went... I truly miss some classics such as amazing raft adventure, or spoooooky game. I also beg you to save Unikitty, it’s a great show, pawsome characters, and you got yourself some amazing voice actors too.. so, why quit the show when you already spent so much time on it? I would love if you would bring back the missing episodes, and create new adventures for my cartoon crush, Hawkodile? Although, you got a decent app, I am more concerned with why you quit Unikitty. And also when I looked at my tv, 90% of the episodes where translated to Portuguese. I also have a request, could you make a episode where Hawkodile gets, well, a little overweight? Or add one with a vampire one? I’m curious to see what they looks like. I appreciate the app, it’s good, mainly no glitches, and news of what’s new on the app. I hope you understand that I miss the show, as I been watching it for about two years. I even ordered a custom plush of hawkodile, in fact two of them. They are Butterscotch and Scruffy. They must have the lost souls of the characters from the show because they constantly keep moving around my house!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I mostly like This app. I use it on the TV and on my phone! There’s only one difference between the on my TV and on this phone! There’s no subscription on TV! Buuuuuuuut...there is a subscription on my phone! So I think you should either put a subscription on both or a subscription on neither... but not a subscription on One and not a subscription on the other. And I love Cartoon Network.(just saying) I love it so much! So I got this app on my phone because I thought I wanted it on my phone because I got another TV and I really like Cartoon Network soooo... guess what?  IIIIII got it on my phone!yeah! Duh duh Duh duh Duh duh duh! Everybody dance now! Sorry it’s just really good that I got it on my phone. But then.. I was watching the new show thunderCats roar and then I already watch some of it on the TV and then the episode I was watching on the TV I needed  to watch the rest of The episode I was on but then it’s like oh you need a stupid subscription so I think you should get rid of the subscription! So that’s my review and please respond to it! It would be Awesome if you did!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hello Cartoon Network I’m a kid that really loves the app and watches it all the time. I love to watch Steven universe. I heard they made a movie so I watched it and I was confused so I started from season 1 to season 5. I realized I had almost finished a episode that I didn’t remember so I tried to watch it. I went through a 3 minute ad  and it started playing it from the end . I couldn’t rewind it  so I watched the end. Then, it played the next episode and it then just froze and the screen turned black; and then the app crashed. I tried to turn off the app and go back on but what I did never worked. I tried it several times and it just kept on crashing and freezing. I then realized it was a glitch so I went to tell you this so you can try to fix it. Also, something about the adds, I started a episode, the add was 30 seconds long, and then it turned to 3 minutes long. I think the ads are too long and it makes everyone’s experience boring because they are waiting too long. I think the app should only be 30 seconds or 1 minute long. And, there is a glitch when I heard two ads playing at the same time and made me confused what the advertising was saying. Those are all the glitches that need to be fixed that I could find. I hope you can fix them.</p>

But from what I have seen, your app only includes: 5 episodes in season three, 6 episodes in season two, and 5 episodes in season one. I’m wondering where the episodes went... I truly miss some classics such as amazing raft adventure, or spoooooky game. I also beg you to save Unikitty, it’s a great show, pawsome characters, and you got yourself some amazing voice actors too.. so, why quit the show when you already spent so much time on it? I would love if you would bring back the missing episodes, and create new adventures for my cartoon crush, Hawkodile? Although, you got a decent app, I am more concerned with why you quit Unikitty. And also when I looked at my tv, 90% of the episodes where translated to Portuguese. I also have a request, could you make a episode where Hawkodile gets, well, a little overweight? Or add one with a vampire one? I’m curious to see what they looks like. I appreciate the app, it’s good, mainly no glitches, and news of what’s new on the app. I hope you understand that I miss the show, as I been watching it for about two years. I even ordered a custom plush of hawkodile, in fact two of them. They are Butterscotch and Scruffy.

I love to watch Steven universe. I heard they made a movie so I watched it and I was confused so I started from season 1 to season 5. I realized I had almost finished a episode that I didn’t remember so I tried to watch it. I went through a 3 minute ad  and it started playing it from the end . I couldn’t rewind it  so I watched the end. Then, it played the next episode and it then just froze and the screen turned black; and then the app crashed. I tried to turn off the app and go back on but what I did never worked. I tried it several times and it just kept on crashing and freezing. I then realized it was a glitch so I went to tell you this so you can try to fix it. Also, something about the adds, I started a episode, the add was 30 seconds long, and then it turned to 3 minutes long. I think the ads are too long and it makes everyone’s experience boring because they are waiting too long. I think the app should only be 30 seconds or 1 minute long. And, there is a glitch when I heard two ads playing at the same time and made me confused what the advertising was saying. Those are all the glitches that need to be fixed that I could find. I hope you can fix them.","title":"Some glitches that need to be fixed in the app","userName":"Englishbean"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4895648933","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-10-06T02:55:14Z","rating":2,"review":"Let me start off by saying this isn’t an app made for adults (big shocker, huh). I, however, am a fan of several of the shows that are air on the network. The issue with the app, to me at least, boils down to episodes hidden behind what I’ll refer to as “The Cable Wall”. Basically, in order to access EVERYTHING, one has to already have some kind of Cable or Satellite TV provider. This is fine... except for the fact that people like myself don’t really use it have subscriptions to TV anymore: it’s just becoming obsolete compared to online platforms. This is an issue across MANY of these networks, not just this app. I’d be perfectly fine paying $9.99 a month like Netflix to watch whatever shows I wanted whenever and wherever I wanted, but because I don’t have cable the only method I have of watching my favorite shows is by going to creepy foreign websites where my adblocker stops 400+ ads. Of course that’s an exaggeration but you get the idea.\n\nI think I speak for a lot of people, both individuals and families. TVs are becoming a thing of the past, everybody’s got phones now: why not turn this into a Netflix ordeal and allow people access to ALL of their shows instead of punishing people who aren’t pumping huge amounts of money into the soon-to-be technology of yesterday?","title":"Out of touch with today.","userName":"KollierWallace"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4893901212","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-10-05T20:45:29Z","rating":3,"review":"This app is fine, you get to watch all your favorite shows on your phone, and the app is laid out nicely. But a huge problem I have, is how you can only watch certain episodes, and sometimes there’s only one episode of a certain season. If you are looking for a certain episode, it may not be there. I had started watching an episode of Steven Universe and didn’t get to finish it, so when I went back to finish it, it was no longer there. I don’t want to watch it illegally, and a lot of the times your favorite shows aren’t even playing and it’s just TTG. I want to watch my favorite shows, my favorite episodes, without having to wait a few days just for that episode to be back. Another problem I have is the login feature. If you don’t log in, you can’t watch some episodes, and they especially do this with the important episodes. Although, I don’t see the reason to do this, as there is nothing you can buy using this login, it’s an utterly useless feature, unless there is a reason but it just seems pointless in my opinion. The login feature doesn’t have to go, but I certainly think that the ‘certain episode’ feature is a big problem.","title":"Certain Episodes and Login","userName":"derri qween"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3459947731","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-11-25T19:33:44Z","rating":1,"review":"Cartoon Network has good shows like Gumball and Adventure Time at your fingertips, but the application itself is terrible. It automatically starts playing a show every time you login, most of the time something you don’t want to watch. Then you have to go find the series you want to watch, each time it opens up the latest episode to air. So then after closing yet another episode you want to watch you have to scroll to the episode in the list you do want to watch, this often times crashes the app or freezes it up. Not to mention the obnoxious ads. Every time you open an episode it plays two ads 30 seconds each. This isn’t too bad, except they play each time you start a new episode. So to get to the episode you want to watch you have to close those ads each time. Then after you finish an episode it plays 3 more minutes of ads. This is dumb on their part because the only part after this ad is the credits.\n\nSo to recap, to watch one episode of a 10 minute show, I have to skip two separate ads, scroll through several screens, and withstand the terrible layout and crashes of the app.\n\nCartoon Network is already killing itself with the new terrible shows they producing, they don’t need any help with a completely useless app.","title":"Good shows but terrible app","userName":"BindiPig"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2948846930","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-07-22T11:14:48Z","rating":3,"review":"Hi Cartoon Network, I love your shows like Adventure Time, Uncle Grandpa, We Bare Bears, The Powerpuff Girls, and especially Steven universe.

So i thought I could find what I was looking for on this app. I went to the Steven Universe show, but I found that it does not provide all the episodes to season two, three, four, or five. I was disappointed because I really like this show, and I wanted to start at season two, episode one. Not episode seventeen.... so was I doing something wrong, or did i press something I wasn’t supposed to, because I was really hoping to get all the episodes to watch.

One time the UI had a bug where when I tapped the screen while a commercial was playing it just shot me to a third party website. Now I would have normally just deleted this thing and wrote it off as just bad adware, but realize that this is specifically designed to be used by *children*.  It even says \"go grab an adult\" when you plug in a cable subscription. CN this is absolutely disgusting and there's *no way* I would allow children to use this app, and be turned into your cash cow. Honestly these marketing practices should be illegal. Shame on you for soliciting kids in this way and to creators like Rebecca Sugar and Ian-Jones Quartey I would seriously question being associated with a company that does things like this.","title":"Good Content, Scummy Business Practices Don't Let Kids Use This App","userName":"Justin.Reid"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"404593641-appletvos","type":"media/app-platform","attributes":{"hasMessagesExtension":false,"isHiddenFromSpringboard":false,"offers":[{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=0\u0026salableAdamId=404593641\u0026pricingParameters=STDQ\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=839488092","type":"get","priceFormatted":"$0.00","price":0,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":32227328}]},{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=0\u0026salableAdamId=404593641\u0026pricingParameters=SWUPD\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=839488092","type":"update","priceFormatted":"$0.00","price":0,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":32227328}]}],"bundleId":"com.turner.cnvideoapp","editorialArtwork":{"originalFlowcaseBrick":{"width":3200,"height":600,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features5/v4/ea/20/87/ea208771-f501-4ff6-43d1-81330f9dacae/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"009bdf","textColor1":"000000","textColor2":"000000","textColor3":"001f2c","textColor4":"001f2c"},"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features123/v4/4a/fd/da/4afddac9-2873-82e0-9701-2509131ee2c5/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"1d5177","textColor1":"f5d75c","textColor2":"e8cb58","textColor3":"cabc61","textColor4":"c0b35e"},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features118/v4/17/c2/bb/17c2bb23-fd44-5ce4-1df1-b90b9a6c1d00/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"15578d","textColor1":"b5eaf1","textColor2":"fbe030","textColor3":"95cddd","textColor4":"cdc543"},"brandLogo":{"width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features124/v4/e7/d2/a8/e7d2a85d-671a-8182-1416-eaf11a5c1e1d/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor4":"b7b7b7"},"contentLogoTrimmed":{"width":4320,"height":1300,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features123/v4/9d/91/58/9d915826-eef8-8aa8-3675-cf0d85aff5b5/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"f749a1","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"c53b80"}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Full episodes and hilarious clips","tagline":"Full episodes and hilarious clips"},"hasInAppPurchases":false,"isAppleWatchSupported":false,"isGameCenterEnabled":false,"isSiriSupported":false,"supportsGameController":false,"supportsPassbook":false,"releaseDate":"2010-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","requiresGameController":false,"subtitle":"Full Episodes","screenshotsByType":{"appleTV":[{"width":1920,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/71/72/65/717265f5-836b-920e-9eba-11bbe9da0260/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"009add","textColor1":"010303","textColor2":"22130d","textColor3":"01212f","textColor4":"1b2e37"},{"width":1920,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/93/86/e2/9386e2bb-1ded-6134-3d24-1c561e6b8ddd/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"00a7ef","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"0085bf"},{"width":1920,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/f8/ec/dd/f8ecdd2c-7c48-ce9d-0292-fb83256fd032/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"00a7ef","textColor3":"cbcbcb","textColor4":"0085bf"},{"width":1920,"height":1080,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/99/05/db/9905dbcb-a087-97b1-4aa1-0893d5d4b2b0/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"0e1405","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"00a7ef","textColor3":"cecfcc","textColor4":"0289c0"}]},"copyright":"™ \u0026 © Cartoon Network.
