Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget, which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!<br />*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).<br /><br />AeroWeather Pro provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. <br /><br />In addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget, which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. <br /><br />The app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. <br /><br />METAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).<br /><br />Dedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).<br /><br />The AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. <br /><br />AeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. <br /><br />An iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.<br /><br />Please consult our web-site for a full description of all features. <br /><br />* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.<br /><br />** SUBSCRIPTIONS<br />Additional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while &#39;First&#39; subscription is active:<br /> - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source<br /> - Meteograms<br /> - Alert push notifications<br /> - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)<br /> - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)<br /> - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)<br /> - Imagery and Charts (requires &#39;Captain&#39; subscription)<br /> - SIGMETs (requires &#39;Captain&#39; subscription)<br /><br />Additional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.<br /><br />The subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.<br /><br />Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I upgraded from the lite a few months ago after a having the lite for years and was pleasantly surprised. <br /><br />Nice app and I like the integration with Apple Watch. It’s very helpful. <br /><br />It’s irritating to have so many things to buy. It’s like the MyRadar which is super annoying. I’d rather pay one fee and get it all but I understand catering to different needs. <br /><br />The Apple Watch loading was super slow and I’m glad it was updated. I’d like to see the Apple Watch app be independent of the iPhone so you can check weather without the phone being around. I’d also like to see NOTAMS grouped as a list (all stations) or instead of having to go to each airport. Also, is there a way to add winds aloft near your airport?<br /><br />Thanks for your hard work on this app.<br /><br />===21 Oct Update===<br />Apple Watch metar update is so slow it’s unusable. It doesn’t update when you hit refresh and it refreshes about once a day if any. I’ve reset both phone and watch and reinstalled on watch. The previous update was much better even though it was 2-3 hours between updates. Please fix.<br /><br />==22 Oct Update==<br />Quick response, or maybe I was too quick with the updates. Apple Watch METAR now updates when you hit refresh and updates by itself around 1-2 hours. The display symbol instead of text does not work on the Apple Watch 4. It is always the symbol even though the complication overview shows VFR.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Love the app on the iPhone and iPad, however, the Apple Watch has always been hit or miss.  After I finally got it to work on my Apple Watch, it quit working after the latest update. I have tried all the tricks...uninstall/reinstall app, power-down/restart devises, delete/reinstall airport in the widget.  Very aggravating.<br /><br />Ok.  An update: after messing with it all day, I figured out that there is now an iPhone  group that has to be selected in the configuration menu on the iPhone.  Then on the Apple Watch, you have to press and hold the airport station to set your complication.  Once I figured all this out, it works pretty cool.  I even like the fact you can change from your iPhone list to all nearby airport on the Watch.  I just wish there was a better tutorial...unless I missed it.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I really like this app, I have been using it for years both personally and professionally at work. The developers are very responsive, I have sent emails a few times and they always respond. Recently I suggested they add a barometric pressure trend arrow to the main report page (previously it was only visible when viewing station list) and I was quite pleased when they did. <br /><br />I recently purchased an Apple Watch, and have been playing with that interface. It’s too early for me to formulate an educated opinion, but it seems to work. Had a couple issues getting weather to update on the watch but I believe I have it figured out now. Overall a great app, thanks for the quality product.</p>

Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget, which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station.

It’s very helpful. \n\nIt’s irritating to have so many things to buy. It’s like the MyRadar which is super annoying. I’d rather pay one fee and get it all but I understand catering to different needs. \n\nThe Apple Watch loading was super slow and I’m glad it was updated. I’d like to see the Apple Watch app be independent of the iPhone so you can check weather without the phone being around. I’d also like to see NOTAMS grouped as a list (all stations) or instead of having to go to each airport. Also, is there a way to add winds aloft near your airport?\n\nThanks for your hard work on this app.\n\n===21 Oct Update===\nApple Watch metar update is so slow it’s unusable. It doesn’t update when you hit refresh and it refreshes about once a day if any. I’ve reset both phone and watch and reinstalled on watch. The previous update was much better even though it was 2-3 hours between updates. Please fix.\n\n==22 Oct Update==\nQuick response, or maybe I was too quick with the updates. Apple Watch METAR now updates when you hit refresh and updates by itself around 1-2 hours. The display symbol instead of text does not work on the Apple Watch 4. It is always the symbol even though the complication overview shows VFR.","title":"Great app for aviation","userName":"iVision"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1905172871","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2017-11-08T03:51:14Z","rating":4,"review":"Love the app on the iPhone and iPad, however, the Apple Watch has always been hit or miss.

I have tried all the tricks...uninstall/reinstall app, power-down/restart devises, delete/reinstall airport in the widget.  Very aggravating.\n\nOk.  An update: after messing with it all day, I figured out that there is now an iPhone  group that has to be selected in the configuration menu on the iPhone.  Then on the Apple Watch, you have to press and hold the airport station to set your complication.  Once I figured all this out, it works pretty cool.

2008-2021 Lakehorn AG","description":{"standard":"*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Pro provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget, which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"},"versionHistory":[{"versionDisplay":"3.1.4","releaseNotes":"New:\n- Added \"Recently Searched\" group (tap on ooo-button to make it visible)\n- Added \"Cold Temperature Correction\" in Tools\n\nNew included in subscription plans:\n- Added runway visual range (RVR) in runway list with real-time data for bigger US airports and from METAR where available otherwise (First or Captain subscription)\n- Extended METAR archive from 6 to 12 months (First or Captain subscription)\n\nChanged and fixed:\n- Minor improvements\n- Minor bugfixing (e.g., SNOWTAM filter, restore purchase for cloud-sync)\n- Database update (2021-02-25)","releaseDate":"2021-03-04"},{"versionDisplay":"3.1.3","releaseNotes":"- Minor improvements (added METAR wind in runways time selector; added cloud ceiling in map METAR plots; more weather extremes)\n- Fixed bug related to subscription issues in some cases (please do \"Restore Purchase\" in settings if it doesn't show up)\n- Minor bug fixing\n- Database update (2021-02-03)","releaseDate":"2021-02-08"},{"versionDisplay":"3.1.2","releaseNotes":"- Improved METAR/TAF coverage Australia and Colombia (for First or Captain subscriptions only)\n- Updated help page\n- Bug fixing (e.g., US radar imagery)\n- Database update (2021-01-16)","releaseDate":"2021-01-19"},{"versionDisplay":"3.1.1","releaseNotes":"In this release:\n- Changed US radar imagery to new US NOAA system\n- Improved US ATC Delay alerts coverage\n- Minor bug fixing (e.g., NOTAM sort order; expired NOTAMs)\n- Database update (2020-12-17)\n\n\nVersion 3.1:\n- Added simple offline map layer with countries borders (does not require any internet connection); requires iOS 13 or higher\n- Added cloud ceiling in METAR plot widget (notation as in METAR for BKN and OVC only; located between pressure and ICAO identifier)\n- Added alert push notifications for US ATC Delays (First or Captain subscription)\n- Added alert push notifications for SIGMET (Captain subscription)\n- Added \"Weather/Low-Level Clouds\" forecast charts for Europe (Captain subscription)\n- Minor improvements (e.g., display of NOTAM issue date, layout of meteogramm home screen widget, display of gusts in TAF in runway section)\n- Minor bugfixing (e.g., METAR archive access, darkmode, subscription)\n","releaseDate":"2020-12-19"},{"versionDisplay":"3.1","releaseNotes":"New:\n- Added simple offline map layer with countries borders (does not require any internet connection); requires iOS 13 or higher\n- Added cloud ceiling in METAR plot widget (notation as in METAR for BKN and OVC only; located between pressure and ICAO identifier)\n\nNew in subscription plans:\n- Added alert push notifications for US ATC Delays (First or Captain subscription)\n- Added alert push notifications for SIGMET (Captain subscription)\n- Added \"Weather/Low-Level Clouds\" forecast charts for Europe (Captain subscription)\n\nChanged and fixed:\n- Minor improvements (e.g., display of NOTAM issue date, layout of meteogramm home screen widget, display of gusts in TAF in runway section)\n- Minor bugfixing (e.g., METAR archive access, darkmode, subscription)\n- Database update (2020-12-04)\n","releaseDate":"2020-12-15"},{"versionDisplay":"3.0.3","releaseNotes":"New (in any subscription):\n- Added lower/greater comparison to flight rule alerts (e.g., if flight rule is greater/better than MVFR)\n- Added DWD (German Weather Service) as METAR/TAF data source\n- Added D-ATIS (bigger US airports only) on watch\n\nChanged and fixed:\n- Watch: adapted user interface for watchOS 7 (removed force-touch menus)\n- Minor improvements (e.g., TAF remaining time)\n- Bugfixing (e.g., fixed missing advisory and imagery/charts group)\n- Database update (2020-11-05)","releaseDate":"2020-11-06"},{"versionDisplay":"3.0.2","releaseNotes":"Info: Today Widgets (prior to iOS 14) are still available.
