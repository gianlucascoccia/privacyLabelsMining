      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. <br />My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!<br />I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. <br />Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. <br />All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>High School was a long time ago for me, but I loved the swim team! My daughter has been swimming for high school too and I’ve always loved watching her! So when a gym with a pool opened up close by I signed up before they finished building it. The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50! Here’s to swimming and my personal MySwimPro coach! One of the best investments I’ve ever made for myself! You’ll love it too!!</p>

By visiting our Website and/or using our Services on the Platform, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use. This page was updated May 17, 2018.\n\n\nThe Information We Collect\n\n1. Personal Information \n\nWhen you sign up to become a Registered User, enter any promotion, contest, or sweepstakes, or sign up for our newsletter or other publications, you will be required to provide us with personal information about yourself, which may include your name, address, e-mail address, and phone number. If you elect to sign in to the Platform using Facebook Connect or Twitter Connect, you are authorizing MySwimPro to collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any and all information that you agreed that Facebook, Inc.

Such information may include, without limitation, your first and last name, Facebook or Twitter username, Facebook or Twitter profile picture, unique Facebook or Twitter identifier and access token, and e-mail address. Facebook Connect and Twitter Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on the Platform to your profile page to share with others within your network or opt out of information you do not wish to share. All information collected pursuant to this section is collectively referred to as “Personal Information.” We do not collect or access any Personal Information from you when you use the Services unless you provide us with the Personal Information voluntarily or authorize us to access it. \n\n2. Other Information \n\nWe may collect additional information (collectively, the “Other Information”). Such Other Information may include: \na. From You. Additional information about yourself that you voluntarily provide to us, including through Apple's HealthKit service, such as product and service preferences; workout details; your sex, age, height, weight, and other demographic and physical details; and other information that does not identify you personally, like heart rate and active calorie burn. \nb. From Your Activity. Information that we automatically collect when you use the Services, including, without limitation: IP addresses, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, sections of the Website visited, etc.; Information about a mobile device, including universally unique ID (“UUID”), Platform type and version (e.g., iOS or Android), carrier and country location, hardware and processor information (storage, chip speed, camera resolution, NFC enabled, and network type (WiFi, 2G, 3G, 4G); and Activity and usage information occurring via the Platform, including tagging data, favorites, survey responses, preferences, session lengths; and similar data. \nc. From Cookies. Information that we collect using “cookie” technology. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us collect Other Information and to enhance your experience using the Platform. If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer or mobile device. Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Platform may not function properly. \nd. From Other Sources. Information that we collect or receive from Facebook, Twitter, and/or other third-party social media sites on which you have used the Services in accordance with their terms of use and privacy policies. \n\n\nThe Accessing and Modifying Personal Information and Communication Preferences\n\nIf you have registered for the Platform, you may access, review, and make changes to your Personal Information, and certain Other Information by following the instructions found on the Platform. In addition, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any MySwimPro marketing email. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner. Registered Users cannot opt out of receiving transactional e-mails related to their account. \n\n\nHow We Use and Share The Information\n\nWe use the Personal Information, and the Other Information (collectively, the “Information”) to provide and improve the Platform and the Services, process transactions, solicit your feedback, administer our rewards, contests, and promotional programs, inform you about our products and services, and in other ways described below, as allowed by law. We will never share any data collected from Apple's HealthKit services to third parties or use it for marketing purposes. \n\nUnless otherwise marked “private” through the functionality of the Platform, any data and/or content that you post to the Platform will be publicly viewable on the Platform and shareable by other users. Likewise, anything that you post to a social account (e.g., Facebook or Twitter) via the Platform will be viewable and accessible on those social accounts as if you had posted it on the social account directly. With your permission, we may share your Personal Information, and certain Other Information with other Registered Users in your personal network whom you designate as having the right to view such information. You may change such designations at any time by following the instructions on the Platform. We may from time to time share Personal Information, and/or Other Information with other companies who may provide you information about the products and services they offer. However, to the extent required by law, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. In an ongoing effort to better understand our users and our Platform and Services, we might analyze the Other Information in aggregate form in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Services and/or Platform. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our products, Platform, and Services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes. We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include providing marketing assistance, information technology support, and customer service. These other companies will have access to the Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law. With your permission, third-party applications or services may access your Personal Information. We use standard OAuth (open authorization) to enable you to give permission to share your Personal Information with other websites and services, such as Facebook and Twitter (e.g., when you agree to a pop-up requesting you to allow another application to access your account information). We also use OAuth to allow us to share information about you that is stored by us without sharing your security credentials. As we develop our businesses, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, sale of assets, dissolution, or similar event, the Information may be part of the transferred assets. To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose Information when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency, or whenever we believe that disclosing the such information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of MySwimPro or others. \nHow We Protect Your Information\nWe take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Platform may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. \n\n\nProtection of Certain Personally Identifying Information\n\nMySwimPro discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on MySwimPro’s behalf or to provide services available at MySwimPro’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using MySwimPro’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. MySwimPro will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, MySwimPro discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when MySwimPro believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of MySwimPro, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an MySwimPro website and have supplied your email address, MySwimPro may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with MySwimPro and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. MySwimPro takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. \n\n\nChildren\n\nWe do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 through the Platform. If you are under 13, please do not give us any Personal Information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide Personal Information through the Platform without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases. \n\n\nChanges To This Privacy Policy\n\nThis Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated at the top of this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. By accessing the Platform and/or using the Services after we make any such changes to this Privacy Policy, you are deemed to have accepted such changes. Please be aware that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, our use of the Information is governed by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collect the information. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis. \n\n\nHow To Contact Us\n\nIf you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please e-mail us at privacy@myswimpro.com or follow the instructions on the Platform.\n   \nCopyright ©2016-2020 MySwimPro, Inc.

competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.","title":"You can’t believe all that’s packed into this subscription.","userName":"mtbosu"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4064965496","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-04-27T01:39:13Z","rating":5,"review":"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. \nMy workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!\nI’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. \nDefinitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. \nAll in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.","title":"Great for Pool and Open Water","userName":"granitedive"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4826001761","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-09-23T01:37:08Z","developerResponse":{"id":7718669,"body":"Thanks for the feedback!

My daughter has been swimming for high school too and I’ve always loved watching her! So when a gym with a pool opened up close by I signed up before they finished building it. The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50!

The training plans are excellent.  Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.","title":"Very useful, but a few issues","userName":"p23brian"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1825082881","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2017-10-03T17:44:05Z","rating":5,"review":"I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.  I was too intimidated to try Masters in my seriously out of shape body.  I found this app by searching the App Store.  I loved the workouts and that I could set my skill level.  I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  \nI quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  \nI took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.  It’s a win, win, win!!!!","title":"Love, love, love this app!","userName":"pdeters"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5453124616","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-01-27T02:16:20Z","rating":5,"review":"I love this app and have used it to set and log my swim workouts for the past few months since purchasing my first Apple Watch.  BUT, I was caught off guard this past Saturday when I went for my morning swim.  I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning. Guess it shows how much I rely on it for my workouts.","title":"Great Swimming App, BUT had to uninstall/reinstall after latest update","userName":"osugrad85"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3632372410","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-01-10T04:21:52Z","developerResponse":{"id":6830709,"body":"Thanks for your feedback!

It has been worth every penny.\n\nI have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.\n\nI bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.\n\nThis app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. \n\nCustomer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. \n\nHighly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this.

Then the next day I get ready to swim only to find that its not working again!  I’m so upset because I swim 3 to 4 days a week and when u get n the pool and r ready to start the last thing u want is to start the app and it’s not working again.  I live n Florida and many days I have to swim n between storms not to mention the schedule that I keep.  \nPlease respond and help me with my problem.  I have the latest update an Apple Watch 2 that’s still covered by Apple care, but since this isn’t an Apple app probably can’t be helpful.  Also have an iPhone 8 also still covered.  I’m adding to my review has anyone noticed that there isn’t a good review since June.  What has happened to this app?  When the good reviews r about customer service that’s know help!  Please undo what u did and fix this app.  People gave u five star review a year ago.

It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  \n\nAside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself. It is the best app for swimming when it works, but it’s the worst when it doesn’t function properly.","title":"Works well when it does, but when it doesn’t...","userName":"pdaff07"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"994386450-appletvos","type":"media/app-platform","attributes":{"hasMessagesExtension":false,"isHiddenFromSpringboard":false,"offers":[{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=0\u0026salableAdamId=994386450\u0026pricingParameters=STDQ\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=838521730","type":"get","priceFormatted":"$0.00","price":0,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":7037952}]},{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=0\u0026salableAdamId=994386450\u0026pricingParameters=SWUPD\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=838521730","type":"update","priceFormatted":"$0.00","price":0,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":7037952}]}],"bundleId":"com.myswimpro.apps.MySwimPro","editorialArtwork":{"storeFlowcase":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features122/v4/b8/22/bf/b822bfb2-3122-51fa-3dde-6ed37614be96/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"0051ab","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"20bbfd","textColor3":"cbdcee","textColor4":"19a6ec"},"subscriptionHero":{"width":4320,"height":1080,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features113/v4/48/bc/1d/48bc1d24-cbe7-0f77-4009-6dd89ed3eb25/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"4ea6f1","textColor1":"090b3f","textColor2":"071232","textColor3":"172a62","textColor4":"152f58"},"brandLogo":{"width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features114/v4/6b/ab/a2/6baba2df-8f08-6e4f-7207-3b3d2c311a91/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor4":"b7b7b7"}},"editorialNotes":{"short":"Track your pool and open water swim.","tagline":"Track your swimming"},"hasInAppPurchases":true,"isAppleWatchSupported":false,"isGameCenterEnabled":false,"isSiriSupported":false,"supportsGameController":false,"supportsPassbook":false,"releaseDate":"2015-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","requiresGameController":false,"subtitle":"Swimming \u0026 Dryland Workouts","screenshotsByType":{"appleTV":[{"width":3840,"height":2160,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/17/eb/41/17eb418b-37fb-49d0-83b8-241a9ede41fa/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"f9f9f4","textColor2":"f2d3b4","textColor3":"c7c7c3","textColor4":"c2a990"},{"width":3840,"height":2160,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ca/5f/7c/ca5f7cfb-e4f7-db3e-bc62-abdcc458301b/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"1f2124","textColor1":"eadccf","textColor2":"eecaa1","textColor3":"c1b6ad","textColor4":"c5a888"},{"width":3840,"height":2160,"url":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/2d/5e/9d/2d5e9dc7-6aca-fddb-b92f-025fa81ab7c8/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"1f2124","textColor1":"efeef3","textColor2":"d7cdd1","textColor3":"c5c5ca","textColor4":"b2abae"},{"width":3840,"height":2160,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/57/01/5e/57015e0a-3781-4839-a526-1835a323e578/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"1f2124","textColor1":"f5ece1","textColor2":"e7e8eb","textColor3":"cac3bb","textColor4":"bfc0c3"},{"width":3840,"height":2160,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/e0/f8/28/e0f8286f-7557-58d0-5aca-994dfe6cced0/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"1f2124","textColor1":"fceedc","textColor2":"e7e8eb","textColor3":"d0c5b7","textColor4":"bfc0c3"},{"width":3840,"height":2160,"url":"https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/59/f6/ab/59f6abbb-1111-d1e7-fab7-e4db0cca7157/pr_source.png/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"1f2124","textColor1":"ffffff","textColor2":"cccdce","textColor3":"d2d2d3","textColor4":"a9aaac"}]},"copyright":"© 2015-2020 MySwimPro, Inc.","description":{"standard":"MySwimPro is the #1 swim \u0026 dryland app for swimmers – named the “App Of The Year” by Apple.
