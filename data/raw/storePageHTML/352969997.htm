I tried every way possible and it finally took me going to a computer (couldn’t use my phone) to make an account. Yes, you can use the app without an account but I wanted to bookmark my favorite things. I’ve never commented, never posted so I don’t think I’ve been blocked or sm but now, I CAN’T LOG IN. I’ve been logged out and my assumption was to reset my password, right? Well, it won’t send the email, and when I went to the FAQ and clicked the link as to why I didn&#39;t get the email, it just redirected me to the top. I want to be a member but I don’t want to fight every step of the way. Please, PLEASE make it easier for people to sign in and make accounts, etc. I like the quizzes I like the posts but it obviously doesn’t like me. Deleting the app, if I can’t log in then why bother?</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I like buzzfeed’s content, it’s entertaining and there’s a wide range of things to look at/do. The app needs a major overhaul, though, regarding the way it functions and user interface. One of the biggest issues is the comment sections. It is 2020 and this app still doesn’t let you edit or delete your comment once you have posted it. This is a huge issue! I’ve also had issues with the “report” button, where I keep accidentally hitting it, then there’s no way to retract the report, nor is there a way to explain why you want to report that person if it was on purpose. The login is also obnoxious and complicated, and needs updating. Lastly, I would say buzzfeed needs a LOT of improvement on monitoring bots and very young kids. Every comment section I go into has quite a few bots, as well as kiddos saying “I’m 8 but this quiz said I’m a millennial” or something similar, which really shouldn’t be happening, since buzzfeed is an adult website with adult content (violence and disturbing photos in some stories, as well as sexually explicit stories/content).</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Buzzfeed used to get 5 stars from me, but now the articles are completely biased, swayed 100% towards literalistic views, and trashy. If you’re not a liberal, buzzfeed completely makes fun of you &amp; your beliefs, but then claims you are close-minded and ignorant (pot calling the kettle black much???) They also do WHATEVER they can do to bash our President, &amp; they appear to be uncouth &amp; tasteless. Obama on paper was a terrible president, yet Buzzfeed wants to praise him &amp; act like he’s God? It makes no sense; it’s all brainwashing. I wish articles that these people from buzzfeed write about the President &amp; about politics was actually FACT BASED WITH SOURCES. The articles are just bitter.  Also, the obsession with the Kardashians has to go... there are MUCH more important things going on in this world... hopefully buzzfeed cleans up their act or I won’t keep the app much longer.</p>

Privacy Policy Cover?\n\nThis Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (\"Personal Information\"), and other information described in this policy, gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.\n\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications, such as Facebook (\"Third Party Services\") that you elect to access through the Service. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.\n\nWhat Information Do We Collect?\n\nThe information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect, use, share, and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types of information from our users.\n\nACCOUNT INFORMATION:\n\nWhen you create an Account, you will provide information, such as your username, password and email address. If you access the Services through Facebook credentials, we may automatically collect certain information, such as your name, picture, and email address. We will use all information available through Facebook in accordance with Facebook's policies and your preferences selected through Facebook. As permitted by law, we may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, when we feel such information is important. You may unsubscribe from these messages through your Account settings, although we reserve the right to contact you even if you unsubscribe when we believe it is necessary in connection with the Services, such as for Account recovery purposes.\n\nUSER CONTENT:\n\nSome features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as written comments. The Services are designed to help you share such content with others. As a result, some of the provided content is shared publicly or with third parties. Therefore, all content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us for as long as we require it in relation to the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, subject to state law, even after you terminate your Account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties, as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nINFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY:\n\nWe automatically receive and record information from your device or web browser when you interact with the Services. This information may include, your IP address, an ID that we may create and associate with our content, cookie information, and other details. This information is used for fighting spam/malware, to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on and shared with others, including via email and social media), and to otherwise personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. We may associate the information we collect by automated means with your Account if you have one, the device you use to connect to the Services, or email or social media accounts that you use to share our content.\n\nTo opt-out of data collection concerning the links you have shared with others, please click here\n\nGenerally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site or mobile application. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.\n\nWhen you visit the Site, we may also collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other do-not- track (\"DNT\") mechanisms, we do not respond to web browser-based DNT signals at this time.\n\nPlease see our Cookies Policy for more detail about the information we may collect automatically and your choices.\n\nLOCATION DATA:\n\nSome of our Services, such as mobile applications, may collect geo- location data (which determines your current location) to provide location- related Service functionality. We may link location data to other information we have collected about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. You may stop sharing your location data by adjusting your mobile device’s location services settings. For instruction on changing the relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.\n\nEMAIL COMMUNICATIONS:\n\nWe may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our Services, including customer service.\n\nINFORMATION RELATED TO ADVERTISING:\n\nTo support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called \"ad networks.\" Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. We may engage with ad networks that are members or organizations or programs that manage the advertising privacy choices these ad networks offer consumers. To learn more about ad networks and to adjust your preferences, please click here.\n\nWhen you visit our Site or use our mobile applications or other Services, ad networks and other parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these ad networks and other parties.\n\nAdvertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category, which may be inferred from information provided to us by a user, may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use other than in connection with the Services.\n\nMARKET RESEARCH / RATINGS\n\nOur properties may also feature Nielsen's proprietary measurement software which may contribute to market research, like Nielsen's TV Ratings. To learn more about this information, please click here. Nielsen's software may collect your choices with regards to it.\n\nAGGREGATE INFORMATION:\n\nWe collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Services (\"Aggregate Information\"). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information.\n\nHow, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?\n\nThe Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the information generated through the Services is shared publicly or with third parties.\n\nWe do not sell or otherwise disclose Personal Information we collect about you, except as described in this Privacy Policy or as we notify you at the time we collect the information.\n\nPUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR ACTIVITY ON THE SERVICES:\n\nSome of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include, but is not limited to, content you have posted or shared publicly on the Site or otherwise through the Services, such as written posts, comments, or other submissions by you to the Site.\n\nRegistered users may have some of this information associated with their Accounts. In addition, information concerning the use of the Services (such as what pages they have visited) by unregistered users may be tracked through the use of cookies and other automated data collection means, and stored by us.\n\nPlease also remember that by choosing to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Services, you make your information publicly available. Users reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Services.\n\nIP ADDRESS INFORMATION:\n\nWe may share limited IP address information with our partners, service providers and other entities with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nAGGREGATE INFORMATION:\n\nWe share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.\n\nEMAIL COMMUNICATIONS WITH US:\n\nAs part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us, such as communications relating to your Account. Communications relating to your Account will be sent for purposes important to the Services, such as password recovery. We may use your email address to contact you for editorial purposes, to advise you of any changes to our Site, and to send you messages about our marketing partners' products with your consent or as permitted by law. You may choose not to receive our marketing emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails you receive from us, or by updating your preferences in your Account settings. Please note that even if you opt out, we may continue sending you service-related information.\n\nUSER PROFILE INFORMATION:\n\nUser profile information including your username and other information you enter may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services. We will not reveal user email addresses to other users of the Site.\n\nINFORMATION SHARED WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS:\n\nWe employ and contract with service providers - individuals and entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf. We may need to share Personal Information with our service providers in order to provide products or services to you. We request that our service providers use Personal Information or other information we share with them solely for the purpose to assist us.\n\nINFORMATION DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO BUSINESS TRANSFERS:\n\nIn some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information, including Personal Information, is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur as permitted by law. Following the transfer of user information in the circumstances described in this paragraph, all inquiries concerning the processing of user information should be directed to the entity to which the information is transferred.\n\nINFORMATION DISCLOSED FOR OUR PROTECTION AND THE PROTECTION OF OTHERS:\n\nWe also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce our User Agreement, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.\n\nINFORMATION WE SHARE WITH YOUR CONSENT:\n\nIn addition to the types of sharing Personal Information described above, we may share your information with third parties with your consent.\n\nInternational Data Transfers\n\nWe may transfer Personal Information to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your Personal Information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nIs Information About Me Secure?\n\nYour Account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to help prevent unauthorized access to your Account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account. We seek to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the security of any Account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.\n\nWe otherwise store all of our information, including your IP address information, using techniques reasonably designed to secure the information. We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal Information or otherwise.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions, we will retain your information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the information was collected, depending on the purposes for which the information was collected, the nature of the information, any contractual relationship we may have with you, and our legal or regulatory obligations. We will then destroy your information or anonymize the information for statistical and analytical purposes in accordance with applicable law.\n\nWhat Information of Mine Can I Access?\n\nIf you are a registered user, you can access information associated with your Account by logging into the Services. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.\n\nCalifornia Privacy Rights: Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83- 1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: 111 E. 18th Street, 13th Floor, New York, NY 10003.\n\nHow Can I Delete My Account?\n\nShould you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so by emailing support@buzzfeed.com. If you terminate your Account, any information you provided will no longer be accessible via your Account. However, given the nature of sharing on the Services, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion will remain stored on our servers and will remain accessible to the public.\n\nWhat Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information?\n\nThis Privacy Policy also explains the privacy choices you have when using the Services, including with respect to cookies, marketing emails, targeted advertising, location data and the sharing of your information by BuzzFeed.\n\nYou can use many of the features of the Services without registering, thereby limiting the types of Personal Information that we collect.\n\nWhen you use a BuzzFeed application on your mobile device, you may choose not to share your precise geo-location details with us by adjusting the device’s location services settings. For instructions on changing the relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.\n\nYou can delete your Account by emailing support@buzzfeed.com. Please note that we will need to verify that you have the authority to delete the Account, and activity generated prior to deletion will remain stored by us and may be publicly accessible.\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, you may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us, or object at any time on legitimate grounds, to the processing of your Personal Information by contacting us at support@buzzfeed.com. We will apply your preferences going forward. In some circumstances, withdrawing your consent to BuzzFeed’s use or disclosure of your Personal Information will mean that you will no longer be able to use BuzzFeed products or services.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions in which we operate, you may have the right under applicable law to: obtain confirmation that we hold personal information about you, request access to and receive information about the personal information we maintain about you, receive copies of the personal information we maintain about you, update and correct inaccuracies in your personal information, object to the processing of your personal information, provide instructions for the use of your personal information after death, request to be deleted any personal information collected at the time you qualified as a minor under applicable law, and have the information blocked, anonymized or deleted, as appropriate. The right to access personal information may be limited. To exercise these rights, please contact us as set forth below.\n\nWhat Happens When There Are Changes to this Privacy Policy?\n\nWe may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time and without prior notice to you. If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services and, in certain circumstances, seeking your consent.\n\nWhat If I Have Questions or Concerns?\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the Services, please send us a detailed message to support@buzzfeed.com.\n\nCookies on BuzzFeed\n\nBuzzFeed, Inc. (“we”, “our” or “us”) uses cookies, web beacons and similar technologies (collectively, “cookies”) on www.buzzfeed.com (the “Site”) to function effectively. This Cookie Notice provides you with information about the cookies used on the Site, their purpose, and the choices you can make with regard to the use of cookies. You can find more by accessing the Site’s Cookie Consent Tool.\n\nWHAT ARE COOKIES?\n\nCookies are pieces of text that may be placed on your computer’s hard drive through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site, share our content, and otherwise use our services through the Internet. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is used to transmit information back to a web server.\n\nTYPES OF COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY WE USE ON THE SITE\n\n• Essential Cookies\nWe use essential cookies for the duration of each session (“session cookies”). Session cookies are essential to enable you to securely access the Site and its functionalities. Session cookies are deleted when you log out of the Site or when you close your web browser. The following information may be collected through session cookies: single sign-on data and session ID (to remember your credentials over the course of your session); server affinity and authentication data (to establish and maintain the communication with the most appropriate servers).\n\nSession cookies are also used by us or our service providers to determine whether you have viewed this Cookie Notice or our Cookie Consent Tool and to allow for the frequency capping of the cookie on-site notice (an on-site cookie notice at the bottom of the landing page that informs you that cookies are used on the Site and how to enable and disable them). In addition, we use session cookies to remember the choices you make on the Site. You may reject or disable session cookies by altering the cookie function of your browser. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage of the most attractive features of our services.\n\n• Advertising Cookies\nThird party cookies listed in the Cookie Consent Tool are used for web advertising purposes, such as to understand your use of the Site and your online activities, and to present you with relevant BuzzFeed offers and advertisements tailored to your interests, including on the basis of your selected country or language. We also partner with ad networks that use web beacons to customize relevant content to you on third-party websites. Web beacons enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad networks’ servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.\n\nAdvertising cookies collect the following information: unique identification assigned to your device; IP address; device and browser type; operating system; referring URLs; content viewed or other actions taken on the Site; time and date of those actions; and country information. You may adjust your preferences with respect to cookies placed and accessed on your device through the Cookie Consent Tool.\n\n• Performance Cookies and Web Beacons\nThird-party persistent cookies, as well as web beacons, are used for web analytics purposes for our exclusive use; i.e., for managing and improving the performance and design of the Site. In addition, to increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a web beacon from an ad network to you through the use of our services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers.\n\nThe following information is placed in/collected through the persistent cookies and web beacons: unique identification number assigned to your device; IP address; browser type; operating system; referring URLs; information on actions taken; and dates and times of Site visits. All data collected by third-party cookies on our behalf is aggregated and of a statistical nature.\n\nYou may adjust your preferences with respect to the performance cookies and web beacons through the Cookie Consent Tool.\n\nEffective Date: 02-16-2017","is32bitOnly":false,"isStandaloneWithCompanionForWatchOS":false,"seller":"BuzzFeed","isSiriSupported":false,"languageList":["English"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"description":{"standard":"All of your favorite BuzzFeed videos are now available on Apple TV!

This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.\n\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications, such as Facebook (\"Third Party Services\") that you elect to access through the Service. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.\n\nWhat Information Do We Collect?\n\nThe information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect, use, share, and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types of information from our users.\n\nACCOUNT INFORMATION:\n\nWhen you create an Account, you will provide information, such as your username, password and email address. If you access the Services through Facebook credentials, we may automatically collect certain information, such as your name, picture, and email address. We will use all information available through Facebook in accordance with Facebook's policies and your preferences selected through Facebook. As permitted by law, we may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, when we feel such information is important. You may unsubscribe from these messages through your Account settings, although we reserve the right to contact you even if you unsubscribe when we believe it is necessary in connection with the Services, such as for Account recovery purposes.\n\nUSER CONTENT:\n\nSome features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as written comments. The Services are designed to help you share such content with others. As a result, some of the provided content is shared publicly or with third parties. Therefore, all content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us for as long as we require it in relation to the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, subject to state law, even after you terminate your Account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties, as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nINFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY:\n\nWe automatically receive and record information from your device or web browser when you interact with the Services. This information may include, your IP address, an ID that we may create and associate with our content, cookie information, and other details. This information is used for fighting spam/malware, to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on and shared with others, including via email and social media), and to otherwise personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. We may associate the information we collect by automated means with your Account if you have one, the device you use to connect to the Services, or email or social media accounts that you use to share our content.\n\nTo opt-out of data collection concerning the links you have shared with others, please click here\n\nGenerally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site or mobile application. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.\n\nWhen you visit the Site, we may also collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other do-not- track (\"DNT\") mechanisms, we do not respond to web browser-based DNT signals at this time.\n\nPlease see our Cookies Policy for more detail about the information we may collect automatically and your choices.\n\nLOCATION DATA:\n\nSome of our Services, such as mobile applications, may collect geo- location data (which determines your current location) to provide location- related Service functionality. We may link location data to other information we have collected about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. You may stop sharing your location data by adjusting your mobile device’s location services settings. For instruction on changing the relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.\n\nEMAIL COMMUNICATIONS:\n\nWe may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our Services, including customer service.\n\nINFORMATION RELATED TO ADVERTISING:\n\nTo support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called \"ad networks.\" Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. We may engage with ad networks that are members or organizations or programs that manage the advertising privacy choices these ad networks offer consumers. To learn more about ad networks and to adjust your preferences, please click here.\n\nWhen you visit our Site or use our mobile applications or other Services, ad networks and other parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these ad networks and other parties.\n\nAdvertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category, which may be inferred from information provided to us by a user, may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use other than in connection with the Services.\n\nMARKET RESEARCH / RATINGS\n\nOur properties may also feature Nielsen's proprietary measurement software which may contribute to market research, like Nielsen's TV Ratings. To learn more about this information, please click here. Nielsen's software may collect your choices with regards to it.\n\nAGGREGATE INFORMATION:\n\nWe collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Services (\"Aggregate Information\"). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information.\n\nHow, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared?\n\nThe Services are designed to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the information generated through the Services is shared publicly or with third parties.\n\nWe do not sell or otherwise disclose Personal Information we collect about you, except as described in this Privacy Policy or as we notify you at the time we collect the information.\n\nPUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR ACTIVITY ON THE SERVICES:\n\nSome of your activity on and through the Services is public by default. This may include, but is not limited to, content you have posted or shared publicly on the Site or otherwise through the Services, such as written posts, comments, or other submissions by you to the Site.\n\nRegistered users may have some of this information associated with their Accounts. In addition, information concerning the use of the Services (such as what pages they have visited) by unregistered users may be tracked through the use of cookies and other automated data collection means, and stored by us.\n\nPlease also remember that by choosing to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Services, you make your information publicly available. Users reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Services.\n\nIP ADDRESS INFORMATION:\n\nWe may share limited IP address information with our partners, service providers and other entities with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nAGGREGATE INFORMATION:\n\nWe share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.\n\nEMAIL COMMUNICATIONS WITH US:\n\nAs part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us, such as communications relating to your Account. Communications relating to your Account will be sent for purposes important to the Services, such as password recovery. We may use your email address to contact you for editorial purposes, to advise you of any changes to our Site, and to send you messages about our marketing partners' products with your consent or as permitted by law. You may choose not to receive our marketing emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails you receive from us, or by updating your preferences in your Account settings. Please note that even if you opt out, we may continue sending you service-related information.\n\nUSER PROFILE INFORMATION:\n\nUser profile information including your username and other information you enter may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services. We will not reveal user email addresses to other users of the Site.\n\nINFORMATION SHARED WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS:\n\nWe employ and contract with service providers - individuals and entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf. We may need to share Personal Information with our service providers in order to provide products or services to you. We request that our service providers use Personal Information or other information we share with them solely for the purpose to assist us.\n\nINFORMATION DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO BUSINESS TRANSFERS:\n\nIn some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information, including Personal Information, is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur as permitted by law. Following the transfer of user information in the circumstances described in this paragraph, all inquiries concerning the processing of user information should be directed to the entity to which the information is transferred.\n\nINFORMATION DISCLOSED FOR OUR PROTECTION AND THE PROTECTION OF OTHERS:\n\nWe also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce our User Agreement, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.\n\nINFORMATION WE SHARE WITH YOUR CONSENT:\n\nIn addition to the types of sharing Personal Information described above, we may share your information with third parties with your consent.\n\nInternational Data Transfers\n\nWe may transfer Personal Information to countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your Personal Information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nIs Information About Me Secure?\n\nYour Account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to help prevent unauthorized access to your Account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account. We seek to protect Account information to ensure that it is kept private; however, we cannot guarantee the security of any Account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.\n\nWe otherwise store all of our information, including your IP address information, using techniques reasonably designed to secure the information. We do not guarantee or warrant that such techniques will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store, Personal Information or otherwise.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions, we will retain your information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the information was collected, depending on the purposes for which the information was collected, the nature of the information, any contractual relationship we may have with you, and our legal or regulatory obligations. We will then destroy your information or anonymize the information for statistical and analytical purposes in accordance with applicable law.\n\nWhat Information of Mine Can I Access?\n\nIf you are a registered user, you can access information associated with your Account by logging into the Services. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.\n\nCalifornia Privacy Rights: Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83- 1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: 111 E. 18th Street, 13th Floor, New York, NY 10003.\n\nHow Can I Delete My Account?\n\nShould you ever decide to delete your Account, you may do so by emailing support@buzzfeed.com. If you terminate your Account, any information you provided will no longer be accessible via your Account. However, given the nature of sharing on the Services, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion will remain stored on our servers and will remain accessible to the public.\n\nWhat Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information?\n\nThis Privacy Policy also explains the privacy choices you have when using the Services, including with respect to cookies, marketing emails, targeted advertising, location data and the sharing of your information by BuzzFeed.\n\nYou can use many of the features of the Services without registering, thereby limiting the types of Personal Information that we collect.\n\nWhen you use a BuzzFeed application on your mobile device, you may choose not to share your precise geo-location details with us by adjusting the device’s location services settings. For instructions on changing the relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.\n\nYou can delete your Account by emailing support@buzzfeed.com. Please note that we will need to verify that you have the authority to delete the Account, and activity generated prior to deletion will remain stored by us and may be publicly accessible.\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, you may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us, or object at any time on legitimate grounds, to the processing of your Personal Information by contacting us at support@buzzfeed.com. We will apply your preferences going forward.

The app needs a major overhaul, though, regarding the way it functions and user interface. One of the biggest issues is the comment sections. It is 2020 and this app still doesn’t let you edit or delete your comment once you have posted it. This is a huge issue! I’ve also had issues with the “report” button, where I keep accidentally hitting it, then there’s no way to retract the report, nor is there a way to explain why you want to report that person if it was on purpose. The login is also obnoxious and complicated, and needs updating. Lastly, I would say buzzfeed needs a LOT of improvement on monitoring bots and very young kids. Every comment section I go into has quite a few bots, as well as kiddos saying “I’m 8 but this quiz said I’m a millennial” or something similar, which really shouldn’t be happening, since buzzfeed is an adult website with adult content (violence and disturbing photos in some stories, as well as sexually explicit stories/content).","title":"Needs serious updating","userName":"Highfive2000"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1998978458","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2017-12-15T19:00:47Z","rating":5,"review":"Buzzfeed used to get 5 stars from me, but now the articles are completely biased, swayed 100% towards literalistic views, and trashy.

They also do WHATEVER they can do to bash our President, \u0026 they appear to be uncouth \u0026 tasteless. Obama on paper was a terrible president, yet Buzzfeed wants to praise him \u0026 act like he’s God? It makes no sense; it’s all brainwashing. I wish articles that these people from buzzfeed write about the President \u0026 about politics was actually FACT BASED WITH SOURCES. The articles are just bitter.

It’s harder to follow conversations because you can’t see who is responding to who, or if a sub-comment is responding to the original comment or to another sub-comment. You also can’t go back and edit (or even delete) comments after you post them like you could with the Facebook plugin comment section.\n\nThe comment section used to be where actual conversations were had about the articles and you could read and respond to other people’s opinions, but every since getting rid of the Facebook comment section, the app just isn’t really weren’t opening anymore except to play quizzes or watch videos.
