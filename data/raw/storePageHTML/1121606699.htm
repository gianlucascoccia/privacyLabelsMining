      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Tooth Fairy CAMERA catches a Tooth Fairy in your video recordings. She is shown in real-time, as you record. You can follow her with the camera, as she flies about in your home. Afterwards you can show the video to your kid. *Unlimited saving of videos is unlocked with a one-time in-app purchase.<br /><br />After experiencing his own kids’ strong reactions to this evidence of Tooth Fairies, and stories about the Tooth Fairy, Søren Lisager decided to use his experience with 3D and special effects, to give other parents an extra tool to share these experiences with their kids.<br /><br />“Many children are already familiar with the Tooth Fairy. She is a mythological character, tied to the development ritual of losing teeth, and growing new ones. The mythological creatures contribute, in a child’s universe, to develop children’s belief in what is good in life.” - Maria Dressler – Childrens psychologist.<br /><br />Tooth Fairy CAMERA features:<br /><br />	An animated fairy who can perform several actions:<br />	Looking for the kid’s room.<br />	She brings a coin.<br />	She gets startled and escapes.<br /><br />	App can be locked with a password.<br /><br />Questions ?

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I do like this app. I think it&#39;s honestly the best one on the App Store. It uses AR instead of putting a moving fairy in a stationary picture. I didn&#39;t mind the 2.99 to save pictures but charging 1.99 to remove the Facebook banner on the video is a crappy move to get extra money. Had I not had to pay the extra 1.99 and had there been sound, this app would have received five stars from me.</p>

There is just one in-app purchase now: &quot;Save to camera roll&quot;. &quot;Remove Banner&quot; is included in that, and is not a separate purchase. We have added sound effects from the fairies and improved the visual quality of the glittering fairy dust.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>My little brother lost his tooth yesterday and wanted to catch the tooth fairy on video. So I downloaded this app to make a video. When he fell asleep I went on it to make the video. I was very impressed when I saw the fairy move around the room. It looked very believable. When I stop the recording I went on camera to see it, but it wasn’t there. I was very disappointed because I really wanted to do this for him. I promised him he would see the tooth fairy. When he woke up he rushed to camera to find the video when there was none. I hope you read this review and try to fix this problem. Thank You!<br /><br />Hello again! I’ve added another review below this because recently my brother lost his tooth again and I figured I’d try again and pay to save the video! I think it’s totally worth it to pay when you see the look their face when they wake up to see a video of the tooth fairy in their room. If anyone is questioning to pay to save the video, I think you should. Before, he was getting close to almost not believing in the tooth fairy, but this video made him completely believe again! Thank you so much for making this app! I really appreciate it!</p>

For anybody else reading: It is only videos that you record after purchasing that can be saved. Before purchasing you can take screenshots that you can pretend are photos, and you can see what it looks like with the fairy flying about. If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to write to hello@toothfairycamera.com - you’ll get a reply much faster that way.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>No color to this app. Now don’t get me wrong I’m not one to throw the race card at all. But recently my daughter (6 yrs old) has been having some low self esteem because most of the characters, princesses or tv characters are white with blonde hair. She cries saying she is brown with long curly hair and nobody looks like her. So with Halloween coming up she feels out of place even more because none look like her since she’s mixed. She just lost her tooth and I was hoping this would have one that looked close to her skin tone but no. All white with blonde hair. I’m mixed but very light so I never paid much attention until now. The Christmas app we use has many different types of Santa which is nice if we ever needed to use it. But please make this so all kids of all ethnicities/color can have something to reference to and help build them up.</p>

When I stop the recording I went on camera to see it, but it wasn’t there. I was very disappointed because I really wanted to do this for him. I promised him he would see the tooth fairy. When he woke up he rushed to camera to find the video when there was none. I hope you read this review and try to fix this problem. Thank You!\n\nHello again! I’ve added another review below this because recently my brother lost his tooth again and I figured I’d try again and pay to save the video! I think it’s totally worth it to pay when you see the look their face when they wake up to see a video of the tooth fairy in their room. If anyone is questioning to pay to save the video, I think you should. Before, he was getting close to almost not believing in the tooth fairy, but this video made him completely believe again!
