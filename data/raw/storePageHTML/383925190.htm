      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been committed to Bravo since the network started and love basically every show! Seriously, I love Bravo. However, my main issue with the app is the consistent glitches when viewing episodes. Sometimes if you pause the video you can lose your spot you stopped the episode at. My internet connection isn’t an issue but for whatever reason, sometimes the videos pause and take long to load. There’s too many commercials. I can handle like one to two ads but don’t make them two minutes a piece or like 5 different ads. I purposely use apps to avoid commercials. I love how the new episodes are quickly up on the app. Side note, it’d be really helpful to have the “Behind the Scenes/Never Before Seen” episodes in a separate category rather than with the season episodes. I get annoyed having to dig through the episodes looking for the NEW episode. Thanks Bravo, for breaking me away from my reality to focus on someone else’s problems and drama :)</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Terrible app. App glitches non stop! Constant error messages. No other apps have issues. Just Bravo! Took multiple videos to show. It glitches and you can’t hear the words every few seconds. Plus if you pause it it won’t restart. Makes you watch all over again plus TWICE THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIALS And then MORE COMMERCIALS! More commercials than I’ve ever experienced in my life!! Not paying for this premium channel anymore because there’s nothing premium about it! Can’t get shows on demand. It’s basic AF! No excuse for this garbage Bravo! Keep up with the quality and features of all the other great network apps or move outta the way! I barely watch anymore because I don’t have the patience for the wasted time and annoyance! Can’t watch new episodes at same time as tv air time/day! This is ridiculous!!!!!! So frustrating!!!! Not everyone wants to be hostage to watching a tv in the living room! Some of us prefer taking a tablet around the house or laying in our beds with a tablet and headphones as to not disturb others or sleeping partners etc! Not convenient whatsoever, hard to navigate, find episodes NOT CLIPS! We want FULL EPISODES! They’re all mixed up out of order hard to search never released early etc etc. so lame!!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The app fails continuously I have to delete and re-add. The app will do double talking over from a previous episode and the most annoying is when watching a show, example Below Deck after half way, never in the beginning, it freezes up and stops playing BUT the timer stills goes on so you miss 5-10 seconds of talking then it kicks back in and stops again after playing for another 1-2 mins or so. I delete and re-install and can finish the show....happens ALL the time. The Bravo app support team is very good in acknowledging when you contact them and they do not seem to get the fact that this does NOT happen with any other apps only Bravo, so when they give me instructions to delete and reinstall THEY are not listening because that is all I do and the problem continues.</p>

been committed to Bravo since the network started and love basically every show! Seriously, I love Bravo. However, my main issue with the app is the consistent glitches when viewing episodes. Sometimes if you pause the video you can lose your spot you stopped the episode at. My internet connection isn’t an issue but for whatever reason, sometimes the videos pause and take long to load. There’s too many commercials. I can handle like one to two ads but don’t make them two minutes a piece or like 5 different ads. I purposely use apps to avoid commercials. I love how the new episodes are quickly up on the app. Side note, it’d be really helpful to have the “Behind the Scenes/Never Before Seen” episodes in a separate category rather than with the season episodes. I get annoyed having to dig through the episodes looking for the NEW episode.

Not paying for this premium channel anymore because there’s nothing premium about it! Can’t get shows on demand. It’s basic AF! No excuse for this garbage Bravo! Keep up with the quality and features of all the other great network apps or move outta the way! I barely watch anymore because I don’t have the patience for the wasted time and annoyance! Can’t watch new episodes at same time as tv air time/day! This is ridiculous!!!!!! So frustrating!!!! Not everyone wants to be hostage to watching a tv in the living room!

I delete and re-install and can finish the show....happens ALL the time.

Bravo put the reunion on a separate show, WWHL so it won’t show up in the show season pass which is frustrating.

Have repeatedly tried to play the episode on my phone and stream it to my tv using airplay. I do this with every tv show I buy online. The bravo app won’t allow this- it constantly plays random commercials, cuts to random bravo shows, and then shows the screen of the one show I want to see, then starts the cycle again. It’s like Someome has disabled the ability to stream from your phone to the tv. Why? Is this to get me to sign back up for crappy cable. No thanks.
