      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>As an American, it’s really hard to find some of the best Indian films. Eros Now offers the best selection of great films that you can’t find anywhere else. At only $5 a month(!!!) this is one of my favorite subscriptions right now. The design of the app is polished, and the design of the website is even better!<br /><br />(One tiny complaint: Directors don’t generally have their own pages even though stars do. This can make it difficult to navigate through a Director’s filmography. It’s such a nitpick though. Everything else is practically perfect.)</p>

Right before the 14 day trial was up, I tried to cancel the subscription and could not find a way to do it at all... I tried though my apple Eros app without luck, I tried online and their instructions were incorrect &amp; I tried to find a phone number without any luck.<br />I am not disputing this charge with my credit card &amp; have had to CLOSE my credit card just to avoid another unapproved annual membership fee.<br />Sure their content is adequate but their customer service and fishy- borderline fraudulent activities are appalling.
