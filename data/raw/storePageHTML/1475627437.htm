      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>After one day of using this app (on my free trial) I have been fairly satisfied, and honestly I would’ve given this 5 stars if it wasn’t for the fact that I can’t seem to be able to access the videos stored on the cloud. I can see the thumbnails so I know they’re there, but for some reason I can’t get them to play. Is it because I’m using the free trial and not the full version of the app? Being able to watch footage caught by the motion sensor while I’m away is kind of the whole point of a security camera. I’d love to get a year subscription, but if I’m not able to do this before my trial ends I will be looking elsewhere.</p>

How are you? I would like to start off by saying I hope that you and your staff are all safe and healthy during this tragic time COVID-19 has caused us. I am contacting you because I need your help immediately! PLEASE! I have purchased the app, or as you say subscribed and instantly became a loyal customer! I love the app! It’s amazing, it has helped me a great deal in my current situation and honestly I cannot thank you guys enough how much this app has helped me! Although I must say momentarily I have been enormously discouraged and just pray pray pray this will be nothing but a small fix for your tech support...  😥🤞I am saddened to say it has not even been 48 hours since I have purchases/subscribed and already I am having trouble viewing quite a few of my video surveillance recorded last night..  🥺🥺🥺roughly, last 10 most recent recordings are not able to be played back at all, nor does it show there been any thing on the files, which also can not be shared either so I cannot try to view/access from my computer. Also, just about every single video about 1/3 recorded goes silent and its always towards the end of the video for no apparent reason. What am I to do if last 10 min of ky video is silent? But I heard the convo and recorded it live? Why is this?!?!?! This  information is vital to my very near future which is right around the corner as it plays a critical life changing role for me and I would literally be devastated and lost without it! My whole life would literally come crashing down as my freedom relies on that footage and I cant help but come to the realization I could have just been recording using a different service to garuntee the service I pay for... I was led to believe will be able to access this footage at a latter time without an issue by your ads and company... please please please help me regain access as it is only but fair since I have done my part by paying and subscribing to your service and with all the most due respect I beg of you to resolve this issue at your earliest convenience! Please!! I am literally balling crying right now at the thought of me Not having the footage as it is the back bone to my current situation that will CHANGE MY LIFE.
