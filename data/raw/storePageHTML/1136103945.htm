      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>My Podcasts are my media ecosystem.  I subscribed to real vision because that had an excellent podcast and I wanted more content similar to the podcast.  The issue I ran into is that I consume my content on the go and this platform is designed for people to sit down and watch it.  I don’t have time for that and the podcast has become irrelevant.  I saw the app on my phone and realized I was no longer engaged with the platform at all.  It’s unfortunate that I can only cancel my subscription in April 2020 and I can’t end it sooner.  Overall content is good but it isn’t delivered in a manner that works for me to consume.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Update:  Good to go now!  Problems with subscription update were corrected.  <br /><br />Assessment: The content on this platform is fantastic!  No joke, it’s content that is great for those who want to get REAL insight and learn about investments, financial markets, economy and/or ideas on what to do with your retirement money. <br /><br />	A MACRO VIEW OF HOW THE FINANCIAL WORLD IS UNFOLDING SINCE THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISES.<br /><br /> 	IT’S YOUR MONEY AND IT’S ULTIMATELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INVEST AND SAFEGUARD YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.  You could leave it to the “professionals” and hope for the best.  Hope is not a strategy in my opinion.  Make the effort to FIGURE OUT HOW TO POSITION YOUR INVESTMENTS.  <br /><br />	This content is about in-depth conversations that are NOT a sound bite and very unlike TV/Cable shows that are totally clueless on how to inform  people about investing and finance.  IF YOU’RE INTEREST IN LEARNING AND RESEARCHING HOW THINGS WORK IN THE INVESTING WORLD, THEN IT’S OVER THE TOP WORTH THE MONEY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE TIME.</p>

How we Use Your Information\n\nWe use the Personal Information we collect from and about you for the purposes set forth below. Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.

(See Information We Collect, above, for details on the types of information we may use.) As noted above, we may work with third-party online advertising companies and advertisers who help deliver these ads to you. These third parties may collect and use information about your activities on our Real Vision Services and on other websites, and Other Information about you, to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests.\n\n3.4 To allow social sharing functionality: If you log in with or connect a social media service account with the Real Vision Services, we may use Personal and Other Information to facilitate your sharing of information between the Real Vision Services and your social media service.\n\n3.5 To contact you: Real Vision and Real Vision Affiliates may periodically send promotional materials, surveys, or notifications related to our products and services.

These may include the collaboration tools, community forums, chats, submitting a letter to the editor, creating community profiles, and rating, tagging and commenting on articles. When you use these features, you should be aware that any information you submit, including your name, user name, location, email address, profile information, picture, likes, status, and comments, may be publicly available to anyone, including other users, search engines, advertisers, third party application developers, and anyone else with access to the Real Vision Services. We are not responsible for any information you choose to submit and make public through these interactive features.\n\n4.2 Our Disclosure of Information: Real Vision Affiliates may share your Personal Information with one another for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including for each company’s marketing purposes. Users who visit Real Vision Affiliates’ services should still refer to their separate privacy policies, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy. Real Vision is the party responsible for the management of the jointly-used Personal Information.\n\nIn addition, we may share your Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties when sharing is permitted by you or authorized by this Privacy Policy, including:\n\n(a) to manage corporate, third-party, and school subscriptions: If your subscription is provided in whole or in part by your employer or other third party, we may notify the provider when you access or use your subscription.

When providing these notices, we may reveal limited amounts of your Personal Information such as your name or email address.\n\n(b) to allow third-party service providers to assist us in providing and managing our services: We may make your Personal Information available to certain third-party service providers, such as contractors, agents or sponsors, who help us manage or provide our products and services by, for example: developing or supporting products and features; sending email messages on our behalf; processing payments; fulfilling orders; delivering subscriptions; auditing; processing data or statistics; and serving, customizing or delivering marketing or ads. These outside service providers are required to protect Personal Information entrusted to them and not use it for any other purpose than the specific service they are providing to us.\n\n(c) to provide co-branded services and features: We may offer co-branded services or features, such as conferences, contests, sweepstakes or other promotions together with a third party (“Co-Branded Services”). These Co-Branded Services may be hosted on the Real Vision Services or on the third party’s service. By virtue of these relationships, we may share the information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with the third party. The third party’s use of your information will be governed by the third party’s privacy policy.\n\n(d) to allow social sharing functionality: If you log in with or connect a social media service account with the Real Vision Services, we may share your user name, picture, and likes, as well as your activities and comments with other Real Vision Services users and with your friends associated with your social media service. We may also share the same information with the social media service provider. By logging in with or connecting your Real Vision Services account and your social media service, you are authorizing us to share information we collect from and about you with the social media service provider, other users and your friends, and you understand that the social media service’s use of the shared information will be governed by the social media service’s privacy policy. If you do not want your Personal Information shared in this way, please do not connect your social media service account with your Real Vision Services account, and do not participate in social sharing on the Real Vision Services.\n\n(e) to protect the rights of Real Vision and others: There may be instances when Real Vision may disclose your Personal Information, including situations where we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of Real Vision, our Real Vision Affiliates or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our terms of use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of our products and services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process, including laws outside your country of residence; or (v) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence, and\n\n(f) to complete a merger, sale of assets, or bankruptcy: If Real Vision sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger, bankruptcy, or transfer of all or a material part of its business, Real Vision may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.\n\n \n\n5. Security\n\nReal Vision uses a combination of administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard Personal Information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting our customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services.\n\n \n\n6. Choices and Access\n\n6.1 Your Choices Regarding Our Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Information:\n\nWe give you certain choices regarding our use and disclosure of your Personal Information for marketing purposes.\n\nYou may opt-out from receiving electronic communications from us (including surveys or notifications) by changing your account settings through the appropriate link on the website account services page or following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.\n\nPlease note that there are certain service notifications that you may not opt-out of, such as renewal notices and notifications of changes to Real Vision products and services or policies. If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can change the settings either on your mobile device or through the app.\n\n6.2 How to Access, Correct or Update Your Personal Information: You can access, review, correct, update, delete or modify your registration or subscription profile information and modify your marketing preferences by contacting our customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services. Most subscribers can also update their Personal Information online by signing on to their accounts and visiting the appropriate account management sections of our websites.\n\nYou may also contact Real Vision’s customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services. For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\nPlease note that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion).\n\n6.3 Your California Privacy Rights: California Law permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact our customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services, and provide your name and the address to which you would like us to respond.\n\n \n\n7. Other Important Information\n\n7.1 Updates to Privacy Policy: Real Vision may modify this Privacy Policy. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Real Vision Services. Your use of the Real Vision Services or your provision of Personal Information to us following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.\n\n7.2 Location of Data: Your Personal Information may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using our products and services, you consent to the processing and transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules than in your country.\n\n7.3 Data Retention: We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.\n\n7.4 Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service: In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (“Payment Service”). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment in such a case, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.\n\n7.5 Linked Services: The Real Vision Services may also be linked to sites operated by third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, special offers, functionality, games or applications developed and maintained by third parties. Some of these third-party sites may be co-branded with a Real Vision logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. Real Vision is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave the Real Vision Services or click an advertisement, or sign up for a special offer, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service.\n\n \n\n8. Contact Us\n\nIf you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact our customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services. We ask that you not disclose any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, sexual orientation, gender status, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) when contacting us, as we do not require such information from you.\n\n©Copyright 2018 Real Vision Group SEZC.

Security\n\nReal Vision uses a combination of administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard Personal Information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting our customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services.\n\n \n\n6.

If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, you can change the settings either on your mobile device or through the app.\n\n6.2 How to Access, Correct or Update Your Personal Information: You can access, review, correct, update, delete or modify your registration or subscription profile information and modify your marketing preferences by contacting our customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services. Most subscribers can also update their Personal Information online by signing on to their accounts and visiting the appropriate account management sections of our websites.\n\nYou may also contact Real Vision’s customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services. For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\nPlease note that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion).\n\n6.3 Your California Privacy Rights: California Law permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact our customer service representatives through the messaging functionality made available to you on the Site and through the Services, and provide your name and the address to which you would like us to respond.\n\n \n\n7. Other Important Information\n\n7.1 Updates to Privacy Policy: Real Vision may modify this Privacy Policy. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Real Vision Services. Your use of the Real Vision Services or your provision of Personal Information to us following these changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.\n\n7.2 Location of Data: Your Personal Information may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using our products and services, you consent to the processing and transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules than in your country.\n\n7.3 Data Retention: We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.\n\n7.4 Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service: In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments (“Payment Service”). If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment in such a case, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.
