      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi! My name is Parker. I&#39;m not a company. I&#39;m just a guy in recovery who made Nomo as a tool to keep me on track and motivated. It&#39;s a passion project of mine and I hope it helps you as much as it has been helping me! <br /><br />If you&#39;re looking for a simple clock that can track the number of days you&#39;ve been sober/clean/etc, then Nomo is perfect for you. You can create as many clocks as you need for any hurts, habits, or hang ups. Your clocks are completely private by default and will count those days for you.<br /><br />If you&#39;re looking for something more, just check under the hood. Nomo has tons of optional features like an encouragement wall from the community, accountability partner searching, clock sharing, private messaging with partners, milestone awards, journaling, little games/exercises to help you refocus when you&#39;re tempted, and tons more! <br /><br /> What makes Nomo so great? <br /><br />•  Create as many sobriety clocks as you need<br /><br />•  Find accountability parters!<br /><br />•  Share selected clocks with accountability partners<br /><br />•  Send a notification to partners when you&#39;re feeling tempted<br /><br />•  Send/Receive notifications when a clock has been reset<br /><br />•  Get a detailed breakdown of your progress down to the minute<br /><br />•  See how much money you&#39;ve saved by not supporting your habit<br /><br />•  Earn chips when you reach certain milestones in your recovery<br /><br />• Share your success on Facebook and Twitter<br /><br />• Submit and read encouragements from the community<br /><br />•  View all of your chips at once to keep you encouraged<br /><br />•  Tap the “check in” button on your shared clocks to show accountability partners that you’re active in your sobriety<br /><br />•  Mini-distraction exercises to help you refocus when you’re feeling tempted<br /><br />•  Prevent someone from accessing your Nomo app with a secure PIN and/or Face/Touch ID.<br /><br />Nomo is perfect for anyone recovering from alcoholism, sexual or pornography addiction, self-harm, codependency, smoking, tobacco, drug or chemical dependency, anger, depression, or any other kind of hurt, habit, or hangup. I hope it’s a valuable tool for you in your recovery.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I got this because I&#39;ve been in a relationship with an active alcoholic who has been talking about starting recovery. Whatever he may choose, this app has turned out to be surprisingly helpful as I&#39;ve started my own recovery from the affects of living around alcoholism!  The clocks alone have been a great tool and a wonderful way to mark those emotional turning points when you know there&#39;s no going back to the way things used to be anymore. And the refocusing tools are a quick and easy way to get me to a clear, meditative state of mind. It fills the gaps around my meetings and daily readings, and I just shared my feelings of fear, shame, joy and appreciation and healing with the community through the encouragements section and feel a weight off my shoulders. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ever going to bother with connecting with any accountability partners on there, but it still helps me feel that I&#39;m not alone. Thanks!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app has been useful for tracking the number of days of sobriety with the clock feature. I also like that you can create clocks for anything, so I also have clocks for food addictions. The encouragement function is a great way to feel as if you&#39;re not in this alone, and the distraction feature has simple games to help you through a moment of weakness. <br /><br />What I&#39;ve found to be lacking is the Accountability Partner function. I&#39;ve done partner requests based on the app&#39;s suggestions and haven&#39;t gotten an approval from a potential partner. Perhaps the people that I sent a request to aren&#39;t active anymore, or maybe that function is not working. <br /><br />I emailed the developer about the partner function, as well as a suggestion for the app, and he did not respond. Apparently at one time he was very responsive to messages. Combine this with the fact that the app hasn&#39;t been updated since January 2017 and it makes one suspect that something has happened to him or he has abandoned the app. Nevertheless, I still find it a useful tool and I check my clocks daily as a reminder of the positive direction I am taking with my life.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi! I haven&#39;t abandoned the app. In fact, I still reply to emails within 5-10 minutes. I checked my records and there was only one email within the past 10 days that addressed your issue. I&#39;m assuming it was yours. The email address that you entered must have had a typo because it got kicked back when I replied to it. There was no way for me to respond to you. <br /><br />I&#39;m working on an update to address the accountability partner issue. Many people are sharing their profiles, but are turning off notifications and not checking for responses. It will be fixed in the update. Remember, I&#39;m not a company. This is a passion project, so it&#39;s something I work on ever free chance I get. Updates take a little longer without a full time team :) <br /><br />I am glad that you like the rest of the app! Sorry for not being able to get back to you on email. I just wanted to make sure you knew that I didn&#39;t abandon the app :D</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I stumbled upon this because I was looking for is a sobriety counter different than the one I already have. This one is definitely unique! I love the focus games and exercises, the journal is super handy! And, the encouragement and support seems pretty solid. I&#39;ve only had it for about a week, but I&#39;m getting a lot of use out of it already and pretty consistently. I&#39;ve already recommended it to a few people. It is also awesome that you can use this app for Myriad addictions and even anxiety, I believe! It truly is a grounding app. It&#39;s pretty user-friendly, the only downside is sometimes it&#39;s hard to navigate or toggle between each of the sections because there&#39;s no back or previous button… However, I know it&#39;s always being upgraded and I&#39;m still getting used to it; overall, it&#39;s not a glitch or really even a big deal in the grand scheme of things. The point is this app could really work in providing solid support from anyone in recovery, curious about recovery, or dealing with A close companion in recovery… All of the touch of a button! Thank you for this rockin app!</p>

Now you can track how much money you save by not supporting your habit! Thank you everyone for the suggestion!\n- You can now update your clock category by tapping the Category row.\n- Fixed minor issue that prevented some phone numbers from being available to accountability partners. \n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this latest version, we've made massive performance improvements and took care of a lot of your suggestions. \nWe have a very large and very active user base. Your ideas and suggestions have been amazing and provided a great foundation for all of the new features in Nomo 3. We still have a ton of user-requested features to add in the next version. For now, we wanted to release this major update and get it out the door!\n\n• You now have the ability to share clocks! - That's right! Swipe down to the bottom of your clock to see a list of your approved accountability partners. Simply toggle the switch next to their name and they'll see your clock in their side-menu!\n\n• Check in - This is a new feature that has been requested a lot. Each clock has a \"Check in\" button. When you tap that button, it puts a timestamp on your clock to show that you checked it. Accountability partners, who can see your clock, will be able to see when you last checked in. We recommend checking in daily, if not multiple times a day. It shows that you're actively remembering your commitment to sobriety.\n\n• Clock categories -  You'll notice a new row in your clock that lets you set a category. This will be used in a later update to help Nomo users find accountability partners through the app. It also helps us better understand our users and where we need to focus our attention. \n\n• Usernames! -  We originally (albeit foolishly) required full names during registration. Many people wanted anonymity. We understand, respect, and agree with that. So, your accounts will now use usernames (note: If you're a current user, we've automatically generated a username for you based on your first name and last initial. You can change this by tapping on your username in the, \"My Account\" section of Nomo. There, you'll be able to update it to a new one). \n\n• Your chips are now saved - In the last version of Nomo, when you earned a chip, the previous chip was gone. Someone suggested that we add a grid with all of the previously earned chips. We loved that idea and did that. \n\n• More accurate clocks - Many users wanted their sobriety date to include the time of day. We've added that feature when you add or reset a clock. \n\n• Refocusing Exercises - When you're feeling tempted, you can play one of the Refocus mini-games. They're very simple and designed to keep your mind on something other than your temptations. One helps you deep breathe, another tests your memory, one uses your reflexes, and our favorite... bubble wrap popping. \n\n• Notifications - We're testing out a new notification platform. For now, you can be notified when adding or approving accountability partners, when a clock has been shared with you, and when someone's clock has been reset. In our next update, we'll expand notifications to do a lot more. \n\n• Home Clock - A lot of you wanted your clock to appear when you open the app (instead of the account page). The last clock that you access will be saved as your \"Home Clock\". When you open your app, that clock will be the first thing you see. \n\n• Fixed a tone of issues - When Apple released one of the latest iOS updates, it cause Nomo to become a little buggy. We made fixing those bugs our top priority.\n\n\nThose are just a few of the highlights. We are working hard to get the next update released as soon as possible.

Whatever he may choose, this app has turned out to be surprisingly helpful as I've started my own recovery from the affects of living around alcoholism!  The clocks alone have been a great tool and a wonderful way to mark those emotional turning points when you know there's no going back to the way things used to be anymore. And the refocusing tools are a quick and easy way to get me to a clear, meditative state of mind.

I also like that you can create clocks for anything, so I also have clocks for food addictions. The encouragement function is a great way to feel as if you're not in this alone, and the distraction feature has simple games to help you through a moment of weakness. \n\nWhat I've found to be lacking is the Accountability Partner function. I've done partner requests based on the app's suggestions and haven't gotten an approval from a potential partner. Perhaps the people that I sent a request to aren't active anymore, or maybe that function is not working. \n\nI emailed the developer about the partner function, as well as a suggestion for the app, and he did not respond. Apparently at one time he was very responsive to messages. Combine this with the fact that the app hasn't been updated since January 2017 and it makes one suspect that something has happened to him or he has abandoned the app. Nevertheless, I still find it a useful tool and I check my clocks daily as a reminder of the positive direction I am taking with my life.","title":"Useful tool","userName":"jlangston70"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2184193997","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-02-09T00:24:33Z","rating":4,"review":"I stumbled upon this because I was looking for is a sobriety counter different than the one I already have.

For this, this app is a great help.  I check in with my chips each day and remind myself I don't want to go back.\n\nOther features are well intended but better found elsewhere.\n\nPotential accountability partners rarely respond and the few that do never once responded to check in or communication.\n\nDevotional tend to be insipid bromides - you can do it today! Rarely does it take one back to actual 12-step principles.\n\nJournal- do I need yet another word processor or notebook when google docs do so much better?\n\nThere is reasons we go to meetings, have sponsors who we meet with and talk on the phone and read classic books such as \"as bill sees it\".  For these items an app may be cool but really unnecessary as much as I tried to like these features.\n\nAs a chip tracker it is great - the only negative is the app tries to be too much (as we addicted tend to do).  So use it for what it is good for and get your accountability, encouragement, and inventory through proven channels.\n\nUPDATE:  All was true until developer took a simple easy to use application and rewrote it.  Now it is fancy, more cumbersome to use, very slow and tedious, and buggy.  Reducing stars.\n\nUPDATE 2019. Ignore the above update.

The only thing I do not like since the upgrade on it is how it changed a little bit. I love the chips but I do not like that it goes by months at first. It messes up the days. Plus it also does more chips than it should be. It should go 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years and so on. It messes up the right day since it gives a 1 month chip which is not on your 30th day half the time. And it gives chips every month. It gets confusing .

To begin, the interface is very easy to set up and use with no extra frills and useless nonsense. Every button and tab is relevant to your recovery. \n\nThe app offers a clock that counts the time of your addiction-free days (more then one habit can be tracked by adding timers), allowing the user to earn the next \"chip\" for successfully completing a given period (week, month, etc). I find this quite motivating, almost like a virtual \"pat on the back\". \n\nThere is also a 'Journal' function (self-explanatory and very useful), an 'Encouragement' tab full of helpful quotes from users of the app primarily, and a 'Refocus' tab with several games and relaxation techniques to keep your mind and you hands busy during tough moments. \n\nMy favorite function of the app, however, is the ability to create your own support group by searching for like-minded people that use the app as well. Once you create your profile and allow for sharing with others, you will be able to send requests to other users of the app and add them as your 'Accountability Partners'. \n\nI am sure there will come a time I will no longer need the \"refocus\" tab.

Now you can track how much money you save by not supporting your habit! Thank you everyone for the suggestion!\n- You can now update your clock category by tapping the Category row.\n- Fixed minor issue that prevented some phone numbers from being available to accountability partners. \n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this latest version, we've made massive performance improvements and took care of a lot of your suggestions. \nWe have a very large and very active user base. Your ideas and suggestions have been amazing and provided a great foundation for all of the new features in Nomo 3. We still have a ton of user-requested features to add in the next version. For now, we wanted to release this major update and get it out the door!\n\n• You now have the ability to share clocks! - That's right! Swipe down to the bottom of your clock to see a list of your approved accountability partners. Simply toggle the switch next to their name and they'll see your clock in their side-menu!\n\n• Check in - This is a new feature that has been requested a lot. Each clock has a \"Check in\" button. When you tap that button, it puts a timestamp on your clock to show that you checked it. Accountability partners, who can see your clock, will be able to see when you last checked in. We recommend checking in daily, if not multiple times a day. It shows that you're actively remembering your commitment to sobriety.\n\n• Clock categories -  You'll notice a new row in your clock that lets you set a category. This will be used in a later update to help Nomo users find accountability partners through the app. It also helps us better understand our users and where we need to focus our attention. \n\n• Usernames! -  We originally (albeit foolishly) required full names during registration. Many people wanted anonymity. We understand, respect, and agree with that. So, your accounts will now use usernames (note: If you're a current user, we've automatically generated a username for you based on your first name and last initial. You can change this by tapping on your username in the, \"My Account\" section of Nomo. There, you'll be able to update it to a new one). \n\n• Your chips are now saved - In the last version of Nomo, when you earned a chip, the previous chip was gone. Someone suggested that we add a grid with all of the previously earned chips. We loved that idea and did that. \n\n• More accurate clocks - Many users wanted their sobriety date to include the time of day. We've added that feature when you add or reset a clock. \n\n• Refocusing Exercises - When you're feeling tempted, you can play one of the Refocus mini-games. They're very simple and designed to keep your mind on something other than your temptations. One helps you deep breathe, another tests your memory, one uses your reflexes, and our favorite... bubble wrap popping. \n\n• Notifications - We're testing out a new notification platform. For now, you can be notified when adding or approving accountability partners, when a clock has been shared with you, and when someone's clock has been reset. In our next update, we'll expand notifications to do a lot more. \n\n• Home Clock - A lot of you wanted your clock to appear when you open the app (instead of the account page). The last clock that you access will be saved as your \"Home Clock\". When you open your app, that clock will be the first thing you see. \n\n• Fixed a tone of issues - When Apple released one of the latest iOS updates, it cause Nomo to become a little buggy.

Simply toggle the switch next to their name and they'll see your clock in their side-menu!\n\n• Check in - This is a new feature that has been requested a lot. Each clock has a \"Check in\" button. When you tap that button, it puts a timestamp on your clock to show that you checked it. Accountability partners, who can see your clock, will be able to see when you last checked in. We recommend checking in daily, if not multiple times a day. It shows that you're actively remembering your commitment to sobriety.\n\n• Clock categories -  You'll notice a new row in your clock that lets you set a category. This will be used in a later update to help Nomo users find accountability partners through the app. It also helps us better understand our users and where we need to focus our attention. \n\n• Usernames! -  We originally (albeit foolishly) required full names during registration. Many people wanted anonymity. We understand, respect, and agree with that. So, your accounts will now use usernames (note: If you're a current user, we've automatically generated a username for you based on your first name and last initial. You can change this by tapping on your username in the, \"My Account\" section of Nomo. There, you'll be able to update it to a new one). \n\n• Your chips are now saved - In the last version of Nomo, when you earned a chip, the previous chip was gone. Someone suggested that we add a grid with all of the previously earned chips. We loved that idea and did that. \n\n• More accurate clocks - Many users wanted their sobriety date to include the time of day. We've added that feature when you add or reset a clock. \n\n• Refocusing Exercises - When you're feeling tempted, you can play one of the Refocus mini-games. They're very simple and designed to keep your mind on something other than your temptations. One helps you deep breathe, another tests your memory, one uses your reflexes, and our favorite... bubble wrap popping. \n\n• Notifications - We're testing out a new notification platform. For now, you can be notified when adding or approving accountability partners, when a clock has been shared with you, and when someone's clock has been reset. In our next update, we'll expand notifications to do a lot more. \n\n• Home Clock - A lot of you wanted your clock to appear when you open the app (instead of the account page). The last clock that you access will be saved as your \"Home Clock\". When you open your app, that clock will be the first thing you see. \n\n• Fixed a tone of issues - When Apple released one of the latest iOS updates, it cause Nomo to become a little buggy. We made fixing those bugs our top priority.\n\n\nThose are just a few of the highlights. We are working hard to get the next update released as soon as possible. Until then, please feel free to contact us with suggestions and ideas for future updates!","releaseDate":"2016-05-14"},{"versionDisplay":"3.4.3","releaseNotes":"We have a very large and very active user base.

It's an unfortunate, one-time thing as we shift to this new platform. From now on, if you break, lose, or upgrade your phone, your clocks will carry over to your new device the next time you login. We're very sorry about any inconveniences with the update. We're trying our best to bring you a better experience and help support you as we all go through recovery. \n********************************************************************************\n\nWe listened to your comments and took Days back to the drawing board! We tore it apart and rebuilt it from the ground up! We're really excited to introduce an entirely new sobriety clock experience that we call, \"Nomo\".\n\n- New beautiful, clean, easy-to-use interface.\n- Still the most discreet sobriety app available.\n- Keep track of unlimited sobriety dates.\n- Keep track of your chips within the app (30 days, 60 days, etc).\n- Clock details will show you how long you've been sober, when you're next chip date is, and how many days you have left to get there.\n- Stay connected with up-to-date accountability partner contact info inside Nomo!\n- Give you clocks custom names for whatever you're dealing with.\n- Easily reset a clock if you stumble. It happens. Keep taking it one day at a time!\n- Tons of updates coming in the following months!\n\nWe hope that this is major update helps a ton of people going through recovery!","releaseDate":"2015-03-16"},{"versionDisplay":"2.2","releaseNotes":"✓ Keeping it simple with a new name!
