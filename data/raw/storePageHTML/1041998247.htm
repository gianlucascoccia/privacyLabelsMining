      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Introducing Gym Plan Version 7.0.2 (with bug fixes for 7.0.0 &amp; 7.0.1)<br /><br />Hey everyone, we hope you’re doing well and staying strong. We’ve listened to your feedback and are happy to announce this BIG update to the app.<br /><br />So what’s new?<br /><br />--------------------------<br />New Home Screen Design<br />--------------------------<br />Many of you wanted to see what the progress of your plan easier. The new home screen shows you the name of your plans, how many workouts you’ve completed and what&#39;s left to do. It&#39;s much easier to stay organised and on track.<br /><br />------------------------------<br />Follow Multiple Plans At Once<br />------------------------------<br />Another big request was the ability to follow multiple plans at the same time. So we’ve done away with the workout queue and you now have all your plans and custom plans in one screen. Quickly scroll to the next workout from any plan. Manage and change between multiple plans from your new home screen.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Updated Discovery Tab (Search)<br />---------------------------------<br />With so many amazing plans to choose from we’ve made it easier to find what you want. You’re now able to swipe left and right through each section to quickly see a plan that catches your eye. Much like how you find a new film on Netflix.<br /><br />----------------------<br />Filter Plans By Gender<br />----------------------<br />It&#39;s now easier to find plans for any gender whether you want something different, a challenge or to show Gym Plan to a friend. Choose your filter options at the top of the search screen.<br /><br />---------------<br />New top menu<br />--------------- <br />Your calories have been moved to top menu of the home tab to tidy things up and keep your focus on all things related to working out. You will also find your list of favourite workouts.<br /><br />--------------------<br />New AMRAP Design<br />--------------------<br />We&#39;ll gradually rename AMRAP throughout the app to Max Rounds so it&#39;s easier to understand for new users. Max rounds got a fresh design making it easier to tap on the screen to completed a round. There&#39;s also a new round marker to show the pace you are completing rounds…this is a great way to measure your fitness levels.<br /><br />----------------------<br />New 3-Tab Navigation<br />----------------------<br />We wanted to make things less confusing, so have done away with under used elements and whittled the bottom navigation bar down to just 3 tabs; discover, home and progress.<br /><br />---------------------<br />Minor Improvements<br />---------------------<br />• Added animation when you select a filter<br />• Added haptic feedback when you tap a filter<br />• Added haptics to the Max rounds screen buttons and also when you tap for a new round<br /><br />Bug Fixes<br />----------<br />• Discover plans loading issue is now fixed<br />• The missing Share Plan button after restarting a plan and the missing muscle groups is fixed on the Home screen<br />• Tapping on the Workout Card in the Home Screen opens the Workout Preview<br />• Finishing a workout takes you to your Home Screen<br />• Change Exercise screen not being shown<br />• Calories not being shown for some workouts in the Home Screen<br />• Favouriting/Unfavouriting a workout didn’t update the state in the Home Screen cards<br />• Fixed crashing when users were signing in with email<br /><br />We hope you enjoy this huge update and as always there’s more to come. We know times have been really tough lately for all of us and we wanted to say thank you so much for your continued support. <br /><br />Dave, Paul, Radu &amp; Mark</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I was considering getting a personal trainer...but the monetary investment had me second guessing if it was worth it. So I decided to do it by myself. I had no clue...vaguely remembered doing 3 sets of 10 during high school...figured I would alternate between arms (every freaking machine that had an arm on it) and legs (same) and beast out abs, back and cardio daily...eeehhhh. So then my friend said why don’t you try this app called gym plan...it’s not expensive, gives you an organized plan, variety of exercises, gives you macros (btw I was eating whatever and had no clue as to what a macro was...), and you have access to a coach for guidance. I mean that’s a lot of great stuff for like $8/month...I figured if it totally sucked I’d just discontinue. Well let me say that so far I absolutely love it! This app keeps me focused on a set goal; the coaches actually help (suggest plans for those of us who are clueless, check on you and your progress) and respond in a timely manner to your concerns; I feel like I’m making progress; and there are tons of workout plans to challenge you so you won’t get bored (you can record the weight you lift to track progress, videos so you can see form and what machine/equipment to use, plans are customizable). I say give it a try.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I am a retired semi-pro bodybuilder that took a 15-year hiatus to work a different kind of job after a car accident caused injuries making training impossible for me.  I came across this gym app quite by accident but have enjoyed its help thoroughly. It’s free workout programs are bringing back memories and knowledge I’d put on the shelf to learn new traits. I’m just now getting back into the training of both myself and a new roster of customers and have found it knowledgeable in both reminding me of exercises and how to execute these exercises properly. What more could a girl ask for. Paul, to you ~ its a great help and comfort to me to have this app available to me. I’m sorry that I cannot afford to pay for your service as I am a recovering not once but twice cancer patient and have to live off limited funds at the moment. Hopefully with the aid of your app and my new clients I will be able to get the paid service soon. I am quite sure I will love it every bit as much as the free one, if not more. Any newbie or experienced trainer trainee can only improve with your program. THANKS</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I can’t say much in this app... why? Well that’s because my age isn’t allowed for the app. I’m currently sixteen, almost 300 pounds, and only 5’ 10”. I’m obese and not in good shape but I want to be. I’ve been searching every where. Doing research on what’s suggested. And I got to a solution... or atleast I had thought. I downloaded another workout app and found that you have to buy a plan that’s way more expensive than need be. With a bunch of additional things tacked on to lure customers in. I almost gave up there... then I thought that this probably isn’t the only workout calendar app out there. And I found this one. I was hyped. The price was fair and it seemed like it would all workout. Nope. I wanted to be honest with the app so I could make sure I’m getting a workout for ME. But I’m not allowed to use the app since I’m not eighteen. Which for some isn’t that big of a deal but for me personally it is. I’m not 18 I’m 16. This plan is not for 18 year old me. It’s for 16 year old me. And at this point I don’t have a clue on what I should do now. I don’t have money for a trainer and I don’t want to buy a membership to a gym when I may end up quitting. Anyways. Since I didn’t really get to use the app at all I’ll give it a 3 star rating due to the promise and other ratings. I just wish people took in consideration the teens who need help getting fit.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hey there. Sorry you&#39;re disappointed. 😔The reason (which still sucks!) that members have to be 18 or over is to be able to agree to the terms of service. We are actually working on getting the age limit lowered to 16 with our lawyers as we speak.</p>

second guessing if it was worth it. So I decided to do it by myself. I had no clue...vaguely remembered doing 3 sets of 10 during high school...figured I would alternate between arms (every freaking machine that had an arm on it) and legs (same) and beast out abs, back and cardio daily...eeehhhh. So then my friend said why don’t you try this app called gym plan...it’s not expensive, gives you an organized plan, variety of exercises, gives you macros (btw I was eating whatever and had no clue as to what a macro was...), and you have access to a coach for guidance. I mean that’s a lot of great stuff for like $8/month...I figured if it totally sucked I’d just discontinue. Well let me say that so far I absolutely love it! This app keeps me focused on a set goal; the coaches actually help (suggest plans for those of us who are clueless, check on you and your progress) and respond in a timely manner to your concerns; I feel like I’m making progress; and there are tons of workout plans to challenge you so you won’t get bored (you can record the weight you lift to track progress, videos so you can see form and what machine/equipment to use, plans are customizable).

I came across this gym app quite by accident but have enjoyed its help thoroughly. It’s free workout programs are bringing back memories and knowledge I’d put on the shelf to learn new traits. I’m just now getting back into the training of both myself and a new roster of customers and have found it knowledgeable in both reminding me of exercises and how to execute these exercises properly. What more could a girl ask for. Paul, to you ~ its a great help and comfort to me to have this app available to me. I’m sorry that I cannot afford to pay for your service as I am a recovering not once but twice cancer patient and have to live off limited funds at the moment. Hopefully with the aid of your app and my new clients I will be able to get the paid service soon. I am quite sure I will love it every bit as much as the free one, if not more.

Well that’s because my age isn’t allowed for the app. I’m currently sixteen, almost 300 pounds, and only 5’ 10”. I’m obese and not in good shape but I want to be. I’ve been searching every where. Doing research on what’s suggested. And I got to a solution... or atleast I had thought. I downloaded another workout app and found that you have to buy a plan that’s way more expensive than need be. With a bunch of additional things tacked on to lure customers in. I almost gave up there... then I thought that this probably isn’t the only workout calendar app out there. And I found this one. I was hyped. The price was fair and it seemed like it would all workout. Nope. I wanted to be honest with the app so I could make sure I’m getting a workout for ME. But I’m not allowed to use the app since I’m not eighteen. Which for some isn’t that big of a deal but for me personally it is. I’m not 18 I’m 16. This plan is not for 18 year old me. It’s for 16 year old me. And at this point I don’t have a clue on what I should do now. I don’t have money for a trainer and I don’t want to buy a membership to a gym when I may end up quitting. Anyways. Since I didn’t really get to use the app at all I’ll give it a 3 star rating due to the promise and other ratings. I just wish people took in consideration the teens who need help getting fit.","title":"Not allowed to use app due to Age","userName":"Sock in it"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3593610630","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-12-31T01:25:31Z","developerResponse":{"id":6626054,"body":"It's great to hear how much you benefit from the app and it's great to have you as one of our members.

I have had Gym Plan for only a short time...definitely loving it so far.  The library of workouts is extensive, and the app is user friendly in a lot of ways.  Don’t know what a particular rep should look like?  No problem!  Each exercise has a video that demonstrates proper form, speed, etc.  Workouts can be adjusted to different durations and equipment (machines, weights, bodyweight), and plans can focus on different parts of the body.  (Timed reps also have built-in timer so you don’t need to go out of the app to open your stopwatch.)  Paul and Dave are quickly responsive in the Coach’s Chat, and the app so far is well worth the very reasonable cost.  I have already recommended it to others.

Granted my gym is still closed, but I rely on this app that I paid a year for to provide me workouts to utilize. The “at home” workouts feel so redundant. They’ll have “4-week dumbbell plans” that are literally the same workouts every week, which gets boring really fast. Then, the length of the workouts are Soooo off. It’ll say it’s a 30 min circuit and from start to finish, I’ll be done by 25 mins. If it says 60 minutes, I’ll be done in 30-35 minutes and that includes rest times. So it feels like false advertisement because some people aim to workout for specific periods of time and I always end up having to find TWO workouts in the app to do. Last, even when I create a “custom” workout plan with specific body parts each day, it somehow picks other body parts for me instead. If I’m scheduled to hit legs for 60 mins, it gives me 20 mins legs and 20 mins abs. Or if I select triceps, shoulders, chest (push) for one day, it’ll give me back, arms and shoulders. Idk, it needs some serious work before I plan to renew it in the future.","title":"Starting to feel redundant","userName":"NatalieTk"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6558078031","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-21T10:36:42Z","developerResponse":{"id":18702738,"body":"Nothing more inspiring than hearing the app has had such a positive impact on your training and got you over the gym intimidation. Thank you so much for the amazing review, we massively appreciate it.","modified":"2020-10-26T09:02:19Z"},"rating":5,"review":"This app is amazing and is helping me change my life by changing my habits. \n\nFirst of all, I have always used a hodgepodge of free running and exercise apps but have never stuck to a routine or accomplished much. So when my insurance offered a gym special, I decided to put all the pieces together for once and get fit now that I’m 30. I thought about a personal trainer but first wanted to get my feet wet with an app trainer.  Now that I’ve been using Gym Plan for 3 months, I know I won’t need a trainer anymore- this is the answer!\n\nThe gym is no longer intimidating. This app has videos to show you exactly what to do and coaching if you still need it. As a woman in a gym for the first time, that made the difference of me going vs not going.\n\nAnother great feature is how customizable the app is in terms of workouts. You scroll through what type of workout you want to do or what you want to target. There are tons of ‘plans,’ you can pick one or more than one and then edit the order the workouts will appear in. So for example, I have a gym plan and a home strength with barbells plan running simultaneously, and alternate the workouts. Also, you can customize within the workout if something is too challenging, too many or not enough reps, etc. \n\nIf you are like me, $8/month might sound like a deal breaker but I promise you it’s not if you need help getting fit and sticking to a plan. Try it!!","title":"Gym intimidation GONE!","userName":"Jackie.kw"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4016518947","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-04-15T15:46:22Z","developerResponse":{"id":8238246,"body":"Thank you so much for this awesome review.

They have plans from just one time workouts for a body part all the way up to 12 week plans that you follow along. I’m not good with making my own plans so having this app and knowing what I’ll be doing right when I get to the gym makes gym time that much easier. I also really like how it gives you the choice to swap out a certain exercise for a different one if you don’t have the equipment. The only con I can think of at the moment is that when you use the timer in-between sets, you have to stay in the app with your phone on or else the timer won’t count down. I would like it to notify me when my time is up whether my phone is in the app or not. So far I am loving it and will be using it for a while!","title":"Love this App!","userName":"layay624"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2330090417","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-03-21T12:36:43Z","rating":5,"review":"I am the person WHO NEVER PAYS FOR AN APP, until this one!!  I have been going to the gym for a few months now but stay away from certain machines or weights Bc I feel like if I go do them, I'd look like a dummy.  This app tells you what to do and if you don't know what that is...you just watch the 5-10 sec video provided right next to the plan!  I LOVE IT!  It once called for a certain machine that my gym doesn't have, I sent a text asking what to do in place of that...I got a response within 30 minutes.  (I look over my plan the day before) This app makes me want to go to the gym.  I'm on a 3 week plan now, but already have my next one picked out!  This is really awesome and it's like you really do have a personal trainer.  I would recommend this to everyone who wants a little more confidence at the gym.

To be able to choose your target muscles and organize it in the weeks and order you want is one of the things I love so much about it. I just can’t leave this app. I’m definitely going to keep using it throughout my whole process of my transformation with my body and even afterwards. Love the check off in the workout to help keep up with your sets during your workout.

Well, I always like the feeling after just not the idea of going or doing the work. In fact the older I get the less I seem to enjoy weights, even though I know that is super important. Enter this App about a month ago. These guys have hit the nail on the head with a combination of really effective workouts, easy access to customization during the workouts, and providing the perfect checklist to perform each workout. There’s something about this that is just perfection for me. In fact, I find it more effective than having a personal trainer. Time goes by fast in the gym and the results I am making myself achieve are my best ever.

Start by selecting a day of the week you plan to workout, then choose the type of workout you want:\n\n• Muscle Build - This is workouts using free weights and machines, where you get to choose the target muscles. Remember you still burn a lot of calories building muscle so everything will help chip away at unwanted body fat :)\n\n• Fat Loss - This is a variety of workouts with and with weights. They typically include higher rep ranges, circuits and AMRAPs. All of which is designed to hit you full body, lower body or upper body and really get your heart pumping.\n\n• Cardio - We've created a simple method to add cardio to your weekly training. There's steady pace cardio such as jogging and HiiT cardio. Both are superb to do after a good weight training session for maximum fat loss results. You simply pick a cardio machine you want to use, set the duration and type (Steady Pace or HiiT).\n\n2. Set the workout duration for each day you plan to workout and optionally filter out certain equipment. Our advice is to leave it set to the default as it is best unless you have no gym equipment and need bodyweight only.\n\n3. Once you have each day set up exactly the way you want it, tap 'done'.  Choose how many weeks you'd like and tap 'Create Plan'. \n\nThen the magic happens. We find the best matching workouts from our workout library and make sure every exercise, set and rep is part of an effective routine. You get the structure you want but never have to worry about what to do when you arrive at the gym.

Fix for the 'Done' button activation on the plan builder and if you're having trouble accessing your membership.\n\nHere's a recap of features in 6.4.\n\nNEW PLAN BUILDER\nYou now have far more control to design your perfect plan. \n\n1. Start by selecting a day of the week you plan to workout, then choose the type of workout you want:\n\n• Muscle Build - This is workouts using free weights and machines, where you get to choose the target muscles. Remember you still burn a lot of calories building muscle so everything will help chip away at unwanted body fat :)\n\n• Fat Loss - This is a variety of workouts with and with weights. They typically include higher rep ranges, circuits and AMRAPs. All of which is designed to hit you full body, lower body or upper body and really get your heart pumping.\n\n• Cardio - We've created a simple method to add cardio to your weekly training. There's steady pace cardio such as jogging and HiiT cardio. Both are superb to do after a good weight training session for maximum fat loss results. You simply pick a cardio machine you want to use, set the duration and type (Steady Pace or HiiT).\n\n2. Set the workout duration for each day you plan to workout and optionally filter out certain equipment. Our advice is to leave it set to the default as it is best unless you have no gym equipment and need bodyweight only.\n\n3. Once you have each day set up exactly the way you want it, tap 'done'.  Choose how many weeks you'd like and tap 'Create Plan'. \n\nThen the magic happens. We find the best matching workouts from our workout library and make sure every exercise, set and rep is part of an effective routine. You get the structure you want but never have to worry about what to do when you arrive at the gym.
