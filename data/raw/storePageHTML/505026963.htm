      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Like a lot of others, I almost don&#39;t want to says anything negative because I really love that this exists and that the met provides such  easy access to their archives. Still, it is far from perfect. As others have mentioned the fact that it does not remember your place can be a pain, especially when an accidental push of the home button means you have to start over and find your location. Luckily they break it down into chapters, but it&#39;s still something I&#39;m used to in nearly every other app (even safari saves your place in the middle of a video if you change apps).<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest complaint, though, is that the audio seems incredibly compressed. When a full chorus is singing it gets really tinny and kind of unbearable. I&#39;ve listened to the same sections streamed through the met&#39;s website and the sound quality there is much better. I have a great connection (about 10mbps) so i&#39;m pretty sure its not that, and the video always looks pretty good. You won&#39;t notice if you&#39;re listening through the iPad speaker, but plug in headphones and it can be distracting. <br /><br />Actual airplay support (not just mirroring) would also be a plus, and would maybe convince me to get apple tv! <br /><br />Anyway, I hope they improve it, because I love both the service and the level of quality that I find in all of the met&#39;s productions.</p>

In other words no pausing fast forwarding or even stopping without completely getting out of it, and then having to restart the opera or the scene. Very difficult to use.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love met operas and this app delivers full catalogue that is pure delight to watch. Unfortunately the app is very buggy and I hope developer is working on improving it to meet the quality of the content presented. <br />Few suggestions for upgrading the app:<br />- improve sound quality. At home I use very good sound equipment and it is obvious that the sound used in even HD streams is very compressed. Operas are ultimate sound test and I know how good opera can sound if you have the right equipment. Ideally you should provide an uncompressed sound for ultimate experience. <br />- please provide the ability to download streams and audio recordings for offline use. I like to stream audio recordings when I drive and every time my car goes through the poor or no signal area I have interruptions that I hate.<br />- improve the info and bio on the recordings and artists that you showcase. They deserve all the credit and currently are treated like sub notes on the otherwise excellent content<br />- allow us to ‘favorite’ recordings that we love and would like. I would like to have ‘My list’ feature prominently placed on the app home page.<br />- add 4k HDR content for newer recordings. 1080p is so outdated.</p>

Still, it is far from perfect. As others have mentioned the fact that it does not remember your place can be a pain, especially when an accidental push of the home button means you have to start over and find your location. Luckily they break it down into chapters, but it's still something I'm used to in nearly every other app (even safari saves your place in the middle of a video if you change apps).\n\nPerhaps the biggest complaint, though, is that the audio seems incredibly compressed. When a full chorus is singing it gets really tinny and kind of unbearable. I've listened to the same sections streamed through the met's website and the sound quality there is much better. I have a great connection (about 10mbps) so i'm pretty sure its not that, and the video always looks pretty good. You won't notice if you're listening through the iPad speaker, but plug in headphones and it can be distracting. \n\nActual airplay support (not just mirroring) would also be a plus, and would maybe convince me to get apple tv! \n\nAnyway, I hope they improve it, because I love both the service and the level of quality that I find in all of the met's productions.","title":"Just needs a few things to be amazing.","userName":"Russell Ihrig"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7023012882","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-21T22:57:30Z","rating":2,"review":"Can’t restore iTunes subscription.

At home I use very good sound equipment and it is obvious that the sound used in even HD streams is very compressed. Operas are ultimate sound test and I know how good opera can sound if you have the right equipment. Ideally you should provide an uncompressed sound for ultimate experience. \n- please provide the ability to download streams and audio recordings for offline use. I like to stream audio recordings when I drive and every time my car goes through the poor or no signal area I have interruptions that I hate.\n- improve the info and bio on the recordings and artists that you showcase. They deserve all the credit and currently are treated like sub notes on the otherwise excellent content\n- allow us to ‘favorite’ recordings that we love and would like. I would like to have ‘My list’ feature prominently placed on the app home page.\n- add 4k HDR content for newer recordings. 1080p is so outdated.","title":"Great potential","userName":"Netscorer"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4957648115","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-10-17T00:23:16Z","rating":3,"review":"I go to met very very frequently and am absolutely charmed by Met recording’s video/sound quality.\n\nHowever, here are a few suggestions to make this app a bit modern (maybe closer to the Deutsche Grammophon apps):\n- allow offline contents please\n- fix the subtitles (if you turn on the subtitles and leave the app playing in the background, the subtitles will not appear unless you go back to the homepage and re-enter the opera again)\n- now, the dream - to make this app truly cutting-edge, the Met should offer viewers to switch between multiple angles. Sometimes the director’s cut may cause the users to lose sight of the breathtaking grandeur of the opera’s staging. The ability to switch between, wide angle and close-ups would be truly amazing.\n- since for every opera the met has already prepared massive amounts of information on the program pamphlet, why not also provide them here on the app in addition to the just synopsis.","title":"I love Met, but this app is outdated","userName":"Lukepku"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"549253326","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2012-03-23T18:39:36Z","rating":4,"review":"I hesitate to even say anything negative about this app because to have such access to operatic archives such as are included here is, indeed, a tremendous privilege.
