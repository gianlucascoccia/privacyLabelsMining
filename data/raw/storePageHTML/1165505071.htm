I paid for it but doesn’t stop me from returning the purchase am writing another review so please help the situation or you’ll have one less app users an everyone I know I’ll let know about how it doesn’t work right. I’m not trying to be rude but it makes you mad when in the middle of a project an someone’s post that you never clicked on automatically plays.P.S it also won’t let me make a video outta pictures it brings me to my home page.

My bad! it&#39;s coming out this week (today or tomorrow i believe) Meanwhile, one way to bypass the sound bug for now is to turn off the ringer on your phone (the ringer button is located on the side of your phone) By the way, i&#39;m glad there are people like you that report bugs, i thank you, it helps me make a better app. Thanks for being a premium member of Green Screen Live, keep making amazing videos, cheers!</p>

I am begging you guys to please do this it would help me create even more complex scenes than I already do and open so many more scene ideas for me. Also one of the main things I have wrong with this app is that it’s a little slow and when you flip the screen it can get glitched and stuff. Overall this app is one of the ones that has revolutionized my movie making. These changes would make it 8 times better👌.  Edit: I think I didn’t make my request clear. I apologize. What I meant was I’d like you to add the ability to add in already existing videos from my camera roll as backgrounds. If i want a moving background say like moving stars or an asteroid field I need to add it in frame by frame as I take pictures for stopmotion. If I could add in already existing videos I could create advanced layers of footage. Like a ship moving behind a cliff or building and many other possibilities. I hope I made my point in a better manner if you understand</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>hey! Good news, you can already do what you&#39;re looking for, here is how: Open the camera screen, tap the background icon in the bottom right corner, then select the first icon &quot;pick camera&quot; which allows you to import your own background images and videos! I&#39;m so glad you&#39;ve figured out that you can reuse your videos as background to keep adding new layers on top, you&#39;re amazing! Please post your vidz to the social feed, we&#39;d love to watch them, cheers</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I&#39;ve been playing with this app for over 3 months now. It&#39;s amazing how much the app has come a long way. It&#39;s obvious the app developers care about the community cause they do listen. In my previous review I asked them to add a way to take pictures while recording videos and they did it less than a week later. Although i&#39;m not a very artistic person, this app has a set of tools that are totally unique and haven&#39;t seen in any other apps. If you&#39;re an influencer or striving to become one, then this tool is going to get you there. The green screen effect is great and that&#39;s only one part of this app. It&#39;s amazing how i can add stickers and gifs as i&#39;m recording live, move them around as i&#39;m talking and tell my story. You know what&#39;s really cool? i&#39;m going to tell you a trick i came up with... Take the video you&#39;ve recorded and add it as a background so that you can keep on adding more animated overlays, crazy gifs and obviously your favorite music. It&#39;s hard to believe this is just an app, guys, go download it and try it for yourself</p>

I am begging you guys to please do this it would help me create even more complex scenes than I already do and open so many more scene ideas for me. Also one of the main things I have wrong with this app is that it’s a little slow and when you flip the screen it can get glitched and stuff. Overall this app is one of the ones that has revolutionized my movie making. These changes would make it 8 times better👌.  Edit: I think I didn’t make my request clear. I apologize. What I meant was I’d like you to add the ability to add in already existing videos from my camera roll as backgrounds. If i want a moving background say like moving stars or an asteroid field I need to add it in frame by frame as I take pictures for stopmotion. If I could add in already existing videos I could create advanced layers of footage. Like a ship moving behind a cliff or building and many other possibilities.

It's amazing how much the app has come a long way. It's obvious the app developers care about the community cause they do listen. In my previous review I asked them to add a way to take pictures while recording videos and they did it less than a week later. Although i'm not a very artistic person, this app has a set of tools that are totally unique and haven't seen in any other apps. If you're an influencer or striving to become one, then this tool is going to get you there. The green screen effect is great and that's only one part of this app. It's amazing how i can add stickers and gifs as i'm recording live, move them around as i'm talking and tell my story. You know what's really cool? i'm going to tell you a trick i came up with... Take the video you've recorded and add it as a background so that you can keep on adding more animated overlays, crazy gifs and obviously your favorite music.

This app makes it so simple to edit your videos with a green screen. I understand that there’s always going to be a little freemium in all apps, so why not just accept it? $1.99 is simply a morning coffee a month, it’s reasonable. I used this app to record my lines for my theatre group, acting out my role as Mufasa for the Lion King Jr during quarantine. I just want to say to the developer is keep it up! You made my life easier with theatre and I’m sure you made others happy as well. There will always be people there to complain about micro transactions, but those are just the haters. Ignore the one star reviews with no explanations and keep your head up to the folks who enjoy this app. I hope my feedback makes your day and motivates you to keep up the good work.

Thanks for leaving an honest review. I'm glad you're enjoying the green screen live recording app. As for the money, go tap the HD button and select the FREE 3-day trial. THat's right, it's completely free for 3 full days. Also, since you want to remove the watermark, tap the $1.99 button, no the $50. The app is completely free full features included! I know you want the premium features for free, i really wish i could do it, maybe find someone to give you $1.99? I need to make a living too. I'm not trying to make a lot of money, not at all.  Do you know i pay a developer license of $100 every year to be an Apple developer? I'm only trying to pay my bills, and believe it or not, it's a lot harder than you think. I don't go out, i don't eat out, all i do is work and i barely can survive, that's the sad reality of indie developers.. If I could go back in time and talk to my younger self, i would tell him \"forget about making the world a better place and creating awesome software for everyone, take care of yourself first, cause nobody will...\". But anyway, i'm gonna keep doing it. I heard there is light at the end of the tunnel. Thanks again for using the green screen app. By the way, you can remove the watermark for $1.99 per month, the price of a snack bar or a soda can in a vending machine. If you enjoy this app and are using it, let's agree i deserve you hand me a snack bar every 30 days, not too much to ask, is it? I just went to the doctor, cause i work so hard, and this is costing me tens of thousands of dollars, i literally cried inside how doctors can ask for so much money and everyone is fine with it, but when i ask for a couple dollars, the world leaves me the worst rating possible, 1 star. Life is so unfair, but i'm going to keep going. The eye of the tiger, cheers!

Thanks for your feedback. Contrary to other social networks, GSL automatically saves your video creations to your photo library app so you can easily manage your compositions outside this app, whether you want to upload them to youtube or use them in a video editor like After Effects (Adobe) or iMovie. You're right about this interface, it definitely needs some TLC. We've decided to keep adding tons of features in the app which ends up making the interface looks a bit unintuitive. We know it and we're going to apply a slick user interface once the next batch of features has been released. By the way, you want to control the horizon on the pictures, at the moment we can't do this, so far you're the only one that's been asking for it so feel free to import your own custom image or video with the correct horizon line, that will do it. You can totally move, rotate or scale up/down the emojis and stickers.

The clear lack of thought put into its way of posting needs to be addressed you can see this when you look through the feed of posts made by members. To fully unlock this app you need to subscribe I did this it didn’t make it any better. You can’t control the layers I.e. ensure the horizon is in the correct place. Anyway without this being pushed to version 2 and having a better interface I have canceled my subscription and deleted this app.\n\nThank you for getting back to me! The reason for Controlling the horizon is for stop motion! I do use after effects and O’Boy do I leave feed back for plug-in developers as-well.

Please let me know because you gave the application a bad rating and we believe it does not reflect the real potential of this application. Please try the new update and modify your review. We think you're going to love it. Thanks for using the green screen video application.\n\n- Previous response: Hi, Yohann here, app dev. The app does a great job recording in horizontal mode (landscape) and vertical mode (portrait). I believe your problem is that you cannot start recording in horizontal and then switch to vertical. You should stop the recording and start a new one. Let me know how it goes.
