      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Love the simplicity and the record interface. Great icons for cortex listeners as well! One thing that I’m missing a lot trying to switch from the default podcast app is the ability to specify how many episodes to download automatically and limit the number of downloaded episodes so a single subscription doesn’t eat up all of the storage. Otherwise a great app all around!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I think this app has the best podcast playing interface. The minimalist interface takes some getting used to, but I like that it’s not in my face like other apps. There is just about every cool feature in this app: skip silence, change icon and color scheme, and sharing audio clips. Unfortunately, there are many bugs that cause the app to stop and/or crash. <br /><br />I’ve had the app crash when I’ve tried to share an audio clip from an episode; the Topics tab show no results for various topics, like medicine, for which I’m sure there are actually plenty of relevant podcasts; there are three different places to unsubscribe from a podcast, and I have to remember the right one that will actually remove it from my library—after I restart the app. Also, I wish the library was laid out like some sort of LP collection, and the Mac turntable UI is glitchy-ugly. Fixes for these issues would have me rushing back to Cosmicast on all my devices.</p>
