      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been using MoneyWiz for years.  I recently upgraded to MoneyWiz 3 so I could use it on my new PC, but was upset that the newer version separated my pending and cleared transactions.  I found that to be confusing and emailed them to see if there was any way to integrate the two.  They responded almost immediately that I could not do so in that version.  They suggested that I get MoneyWiz 21, which is an annual subscription, but would allow me to integrate the two categories.  Unfortunately, MoneyWiz 21 is only available in IOS, but I can use it on my phone and tablet, just not on my PC, and for me, that was the best choice.  When I let them know that I wanted to  switch, they immediately refunded my money and I went ahead and got MoneyWiz 21.  <br /><br />So, their customer service is outstanding.  I have never been able to keep track of my funds using a check register and I have found MoneyWiz to be totally reliable and I depend on it.  I don’t use any of the fancier features like syncing with my bank.  I don’t want to know what my bank thinks I have; I need to work off of what I will have when all my bills and pending transactions are paid!  But if you are financially savvy (I’m not) there are tons of features that can help you track investments etc.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love moneywiz 2020. My priorty was to use an app that downloads all my financial accounts and gives me a full picture of what i have and what is happening. There are a lot of services like this but none that function flawlessly. Quicken is slow and doesn&#39;t support all my bank accounts. Banktivity, personal capital, or Calrity Money also don&#39;t allow you to connec to all the banking and investment institutions--totally pointless for a financial app. Moneywiz offers three data aggregators, if one doesn&#39;t work for you, try the other. Finally, they have superb cutomer service. The response time to my emails and queries is so less than a few hours. sometimes within a few minutes. They care about the customer relationship. Be aware that there is no perfect financial app, because they all rely on another service to aggregate data from banking institutions. so their at the mercy of another provider, but they address any bugs or issues in connectivity immediately. i was able to get into al of my accounts (15 in cluding robinhood and webull) in a day or two. I tried all available apps and services, and this is the best hands down.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been using Money Wiz since it’s inception, and rely on it completely for managing my finances. It is the BEST finance app out there! I am now using Money Wiz 2020. I had some issues with my data - complete user error on my part. Lliya was not only completely knowledgeable about how to solve my issues, but was so kind and patient! Did not leave my side until all was back in order even though it took quite awhile - again it was all user error on my part. <br /><br />Thank you Lliya for all your help!!!!  Wish all in customer support were like you!</p>

I recently upgraded to MoneyWiz 3 so I could use it on my new PC, but was upset that the newer version separated my pending and cleared transactions.  I found that to be confusing and emailed them to see if there was any way to integrate the two.  They responded almost immediately that I could not do so in that version.  They suggested that I get MoneyWiz 21, which is an annual subscription, but would allow me to integrate the two categories.  Unfortunately, MoneyWiz 21 is only available in IOS, but I can use it on my phone and tablet, just not on my PC, and for me, that was the best choice.  When I let them know that I wanted to  switch, they immediately refunded my money and I went ahead and got MoneyWiz 21.  \n\nSo, their customer service is outstanding.  I have never been able to keep track of my funds using a check register and I have found MoneyWiz to be totally reliable and I depend on it.  I don’t use any of the fancier features like syncing with my bank.  I don’t want to know what my bank thinks I have; I need to work off of what I will have when all my bills and pending transactions are paid!

There are a lot of services like this but none that function flawlessly. Quicken is slow and doesn't support all my bank accounts. Banktivity, personal capital, or Calrity Money also don't allow you to connec to all the banking and investment institutions--totally pointless for a financial app. Moneywiz offers three data aggregators, if one doesn't work for you, try the other. Finally, they have superb cutomer service. The response time to my emails and queries is so less than a few hours. sometimes within a few minutes. They care about the customer relationship. Be aware that there is no perfect financial app, because they all rely on another service to aggregate data from banking institutions. so their at the mercy of another provider, but they address any bugs or issues in connectivity immediately. i was able to get into al of my accounts (15 in cluding robinhood and webull) in a day or two.

I had to go in and change individual charges for most if not all my accounts to correct type of transactions. Since I have a multitude of accounts this was taxing and unwarranted for the price you pay. Furthermore, their budget/expense setup was too complicated for me.

We've made tons of improvements...\n\nHey, can you email our support so we can discuss these differences between MoneyWiz 2020 and older versions, and see how we can help.\n\nThanks.","modified":"2021-02-08T14:55:24Z"},"rating":2,"review":"There are a few items I like better on a MoneyWiz 2020, but many items that were better before.\n1) refunds would show up green as a positive item in your account. Now they show as red which confuses me as I try to pick out the deposits in my account.\n2) I can no longer toggle between total cleared budget expenses and the total of all budget expenses without going into each budget item and switching it to cleared rather than pending/cleared.\n3) I used to be able to see budgets with pending items that I could choose to show as $0.00 while they are pending so I can see the cleared total while also knowing there are pending transactions in that budget. Now for me to see the cleared total I have to unmark pending and those items disappear so Incan’t see if there are pending items in they budget.","title":"So many things I could do before but can’t now","userName":"Jrbuman"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6426566237","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-14T00:10:39Z","developerResponse":{"id":17883896,"body":"Thank you!!!! 🙏🏻","modified":"2020-09-15T07:12:51Z"},"rating":5,"review":"I have used Quicken for almost 20 years.
