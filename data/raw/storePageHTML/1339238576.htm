Frontier pioneers and bounty hunters have set carriage treks towards the fabled gold discovery sites in Klondike and Yukon, and to the great plains and deserts of Texas or New Mexico.\n\nYour wagon convoy ran into a bandit ambush and left you behind as the only survivor, but certainly grim with anger to bring those gunslingers to the hangman!

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Stumbled upon this game one day when LDoE wasn’t loading. I must say I am truly impressed. It’s based on the same game engine as LDoE but a breathtakingly impressive take on the western genre. It is a lot more FTP (free-to-play) friendly than any of the other survival games out there - I got my horse (the chopper equivalent of LDoE) on my second day of gameplay and the map is peppered with rare resources as well as powerful weapons. You simply must love the repair bench concept where you can repair almost broken rare weapons and armor for a fraction of the crafting cost -probably the best aspect of the game yet !!!! And the new canyon trials have made this game even more FTP friendly for gaining coins, fuel and rare resources. Keep up the good work guys, and make sure you don’t lose sight in the future of what made your game better than LDoE at the start !!!!! Truly an excellent game !!!!<br /><br />UPDATE : After the latest update 0.9.8, my save file has reverted to a month ago. All my progress in the past month or so is lost. Almost 2000 coins, 14 rings, a ton of oats and oak, not to mention a lot of weapons and steel and high end clothes - ALL GONE. No word from the developer yet. Hope I get it back else I&#39;ll probably stop playing. <br /><br />UPDATE: BEST DEVELOPER EVER!!!! THEY RESPONDED AND PROMISED CORRECTIVE ACTION!!!</p>

</h3>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Not sure why the game has such high reviews. I’m guess they are paid for reviews and reviews from devs. I gave the game 3 stars and I think that is a honest and generous amount considering. Let’s start with clothing. Clothing doesn’t drop for squat and it wears out so fast it’s almost a pointless addition to the game, same with weapons and tools.  considering they want real money for chests that may give you a random items that will last you one mission or more if your lucky. Now let’s talk travel. You get 3 chances to run to your locations after that it’s 20 minutes to walk anywhere so in other words it’s almost impossible to get much done in one sit down. <br />  <br /> In a nut shell this game screams give us your money idiots and we are gonna give you as little as possible in return. I find this sad, games like this have such great potential but are always made by greedy people so they are broken from the day it launches. My advise don’t waste your money just play once in a while when your measly energy cap is filled and shoot for lvl power and say F the clothing. Don’t give them a dime till they give us more time to play and have fun for free.<br /><br />   Actually clothing back in the day was made better then it is now. Sorry Even in the Wild Wild West clothing lasted longer then a day lasted longer then  hours that includes bar brawls and shoot outs.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>First of I would like more weapon variations like maybe a Canadian 1845 carbin and weapons like box guns from the civil war next is more live stock so I know we have hoarse but if you could have cattle and chickens and also breed them that would be AWSOME then another thing is extending the map and more places to go like last day on earth so we have like fortress and even build boats like in grim soul and maybe once in a while a frigate will wash ashore or a whale and we can get whale meet and oil that we can make tar with a new machine called a tar boiler with a new machine called the oil pump so we can pump oil to make tar and lamps and trade it with the trader and with over players at town then we should ad cannons and motors or even howitzers for clan raids and for ranch defense another tip is being able to have a second story for your ranch house I know not many rpg survival games have this but if you did that would be awsome my last suggestion is when the town is out you can you get a career like a chef or soldier or even a contest of who should be the sheriff of the map and that’s it <br /><br />P.S when is the town coming out</p>

By so agreeing, you authorize us to collect and use your information as outlined below. In the event you do not agree with this Privacy Policy (and any amendments which may be adopted by us), your only recourse is to cease use of our Services.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that if you are using our Services through a social network, platform or applications provider (“Third Party Service”) (e.g., Facebook, Steam, iTunes, Google Play, etc.), any activities provided by such third party beyond Helio Games’s Services are governed by that Third Party Service’s policies. We consider it a best practice for you to review the privacy policy of each website you frequent (as well as the privacy policies of any partners we may work with including advertisers) in order to be an informed consumer and to fully understand how your Personal Data is being handled.\r\n\r\nPERSONAL DATA DEFINED\r\n\r\n\"Personal Data\" is information that identifies you or that can be used to contact you (online or offline). Personal Data can include your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, gender, birthdate, etc.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA AND PURPOSES\r\n\r\nWe collect Personal Data in a variety of ways in order to provide you with the best possible experience using our Services. Sources of information include:\r\n\r\nInformation You Provide To Us: You may choose to voluntarily provide us with information by registering or communicating with Helio Games. If you communicate with us, we will collect and record the information you have shared with us so that we can provide you with the Services or address your inquiry. During the registration process, we do collect basic information about you including your name and email address.\r\n\r\nThird Party Platforms and Social Networks: When you participate in our Services which are provided through a Third Party Service, we may obtain information about you from that service such as your name, gender, geographic area and affiliations. For example, we may use your location in association with your user name to display your game score on a top player scoreboard. Your gender designation derived from a Third Party Service may also be shown but your gender will never limit you on the levels that you can achieve while playing the game (which in the free-to-play context reflects skill, not gender) and/or to a specific gameplay style or type of character. As a developer of an application which is provided through a Third Party Service, Helio Games is required to follow the governing policies of such Third Party Service (including the handling of Personal Data).\r\n\r\nIP Addresses: We do monitor and store information about the IP addresses from which you access our Services. In general, these log files are used to monitor traffic on our Services, to troubleshoot technical problems and to collect aggregate information (e.g., to monitor and analyze demographic and preference information among our users). We may block certain IP addresses to comply with specific license agreements and/or in the event we detect user abuse of our Services. IP addresses could also be used to personally identify you in order to enforce our Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nGeolocation: Geolocation refers to the identification of the geographic location of a user or computing device via a variety of data collection mechanisms. Geolocation services use various means to ascertain location including network routing addresses, internal GPS devices and/or the newer W3C Geolocation standard. Our site may use various of these standards depending upon the platform and device that you are using to play our games.\r\n\r\nCookies: Helio Games utilizes cookies in connection with the operation of its Services. If you have registered to use our Services and/or play our games, your consent during the registration process means you have agreed to our use of cookies in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Policy. Cookies are used on our site to facilitate user sign-on, and to retain user preferences and other information. Third party service providers may use cookies to track whether you have clicked on an advertisement and registered to play our games. A “cookie” is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Although your browser may be pre-set to accept cookies, you can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please note, however, that some parts of our Services will not function properly if you disable cookies.\r\n\r\nOther Data Collection Mechanisms: We may employ technologies including (i) clear Graphics Interchange Formats (“GIFs”) (i.e., web bugs, beacons or tags), which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation or registration; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to prevent fraud, remember your progress on certain in-game tasks and in-game settings. Clear GIFs are not used to collect Personal Data about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page.\r\n\r\nAGGREGATED DATA; NON-PERSONAL DATA GATHERING AND ANALYTICS\r\n\r\nIn addition to Personal Data, we collect a variety of data that is not used to specifically identify or contact you. This type of data is used to analyze and enhance our Services.\r\n\r\nExamples of such information include:\r\n\r\nGeneral Use Information: We may collect general information about our users’ interaction with our product such as your internet protocol address, browser type, referring and exit URLs, clicks, domain names, pages viewed, the amount of time spent viewing a particular page, the time such activities took place, etc.\r\n\r\nGame Play Information: We may collect and retain information relating to your interaction with our Services. For example, we may monitor the number and type of activities you participate in during a particular session, your scores and the length of time you spend on our Services.\r\n\r\nAnalytic Metrics Tool and Other Technologies: Helio Games uses its own tools and technologies to analyze non-Personal Data when you use our Services The information collected may include data about your hardware system, mobile device (if applicable), media, Internet and website usage and how you use our Services. We also analyze and track your game statistics, feature usage and purchase history, as well as IP, MAC, Android and/or iOS Addresses, and mobile ID (as applicable).\r\n\r\nThird Parties: We may use service providers and third party tools and technology to provide you with a superior experience and these parties may share information they collect about you with us. Personal Data you provide to those third parties will fall under their respective privacy policies. If such a third party provides us with your Personal Data, we will handle it in accordance with this privacy policy.\r\n\r\nUSER GENERATED CONTENT\r\n\r\nUser generated content includes various types of content which is publicly available and is produced by end users. For example, wall posts, messages, and actions with other end users would fall under this definition. It is possible that the user generated content you choose to provide may contain Personal Data.

We consider it a best practice for you to review the privacy policy of each website you frequent (as well as the privacy policies of any partners we may work with including advertisers) in order to be an informed consumer and to fully understand how your Personal Data is being handled.\r\n\r\nPERSONAL DATA DEFINED\r\n\r\n\"Personal Data\" is information that identifies you or that can be used to contact you (online or offline). Personal Data can include your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, gender, birthdate, etc.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA AND PURPOSES\r\n\r\nWe collect Personal Data in a variety of ways in order to provide you with the best possible experience using our Services. Sources of information include:\r\n\r\nInformation You Provide To Us: You may choose to voluntarily provide us with information by registering or communicating with Helio Games. If you communicate with us, we will collect and record the information you have shared with us so that we can provide you with the Services or address your inquiry. During the registration process, we do collect basic information about you including your name and email address.\r\n\r\nThird Party Platforms and Social Networks: When you participate in our Services which are provided through a Third Party Service, we may obtain information about you from that service such as your name, gender, geographic area and affiliations. For example, we may use your location in association with your user name to display your game score on a top player scoreboard. Your gender designation derived from a Third Party Service may also be shown but your gender will never limit you on the levels that you can achieve while playing the game (which in the free-to-play context reflects skill, not gender) and/or to a specific gameplay style or type of character. As a developer of an application which is provided through a Third Party Service, Helio Games is required to follow the governing policies of such Third Party Service (including the handling of Personal Data).\r\n\r\nIP Addresses: We do monitor and store information about the IP addresses from which you access our Services. In general, these log files are used to monitor traffic on our Services, to troubleshoot technical problems and to collect aggregate information (e.g., to monitor and analyze demographic and preference information among our users). We may block certain IP addresses to comply with specific license agreements and/or in the event we detect user abuse of our Services. IP addresses could also be used to personally identify you in order to enforce our Terms of Service.\r\n\r\nGeolocation: Geolocation refers to the identification of the geographic location of a user or computing device via a variety of data collection mechanisms. Geolocation services use various means to ascertain location including network routing addresses, internal GPS devices and/or the newer W3C Geolocation standard. Our site may use various of these standards depending upon the platform and device that you are using to play our games.\r\n\r\nCookies: Helio Games utilizes cookies in connection with the operation of its Services. If you have registered to use our Services and/or play our games, your consent during the registration process means you have agreed to our use of cookies in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Policy. Cookies are used on our site to facilitate user sign-on, and to retain user preferences and other information. Third party service providers may use cookies to track whether you have clicked on an advertisement and registered to play our games. A “cookie” is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Although your browser may be pre-set to accept cookies, you can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please note, however, that some parts of our Services will not function properly if you disable cookies.\r\n\r\nOther Data Collection Mechanisms: We may employ technologies including (i) clear Graphics Interchange Formats (“GIFs”) (i.e., web bugs, beacons or tags), which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation or registration; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to prevent fraud, remember your progress on certain in-game tasks and in-game settings. Clear GIFs are not used to collect Personal Data about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page.\r\n\r\nAGGREGATED DATA; NON-PERSONAL DATA GATHERING AND ANALYTICS\r\n\r\nIn addition to Personal Data, we collect a variety of data that is not used to specifically identify or contact you.

Personal Data you provide to those third parties will fall under their respective privacy policies. If such a third party provides us with your Personal Data, we will handle it in accordance with this privacy policy.\r\n\r\nUSER GENERATED CONTENT\r\n\r\nUser generated content includes various types of content which is publicly available and is produced by end users. For example, wall posts, messages, and actions with other end users would fall under this definition. It is possible that the user generated content you choose to provide may contain Personal Data. Please be aware that we cannot guarantee protection for information you make available publicly through comments, information sharing mechanisms, wall posts, etc. Any user generated content you share while using our Services on a social network, will very likely be disseminated broadly through the social network. Also, any Personal Data that is publicly shared by the user could be harvested by third parties (including by other users of the social network) with access to it and we cannot control those third parties' use of such information. Please bear these factors in mind before sharing any content with us.\r\n\r\nWHAT WE DO NOT DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThird Party Services - Social Network Data: We do not directly or indirectly transfer any Personal Data we receive from social networks such as Facebook or Google Play to third parties.

In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\nIn the event that we no longer operate a specific game through our Services, we may work with the subsequent game operator to offer you the ability to continue to play the game with the new game operator. This might involve inviting you to create a new user name and password in order to continue playing the game with the new game operator.\r\n\r\nIf material changes to Helio Games's privacy practices will occur as a result of a business transition, we will notify you and other users of the business transition prior to transferring your Personal Data as set forth below under Changes to Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\nSECURITY OF OUR SERVICES\r\n\r\nWe use encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of the information that you share with us.

I must say I am truly impressed. It’s based on the same game engine as LDoE but a breathtakingly impressive take on the western genre. It is a lot more FTP (free-to-play) friendly than any of the other survival games out there - I got my horse (the chopper equivalent of LDoE) on my second day of gameplay and the map is peppered with rare resources as well as powerful weapons. You simply must love the repair bench concept where you can repair almost broken rare weapons and armor for a fraction of the crafting cost -probably the best aspect of the game yet !!!! And the new canyon trials have made this game even more FTP friendly for gaining coins, fuel and rare resources. Keep up the good work guys, and make sure you don’t lose sight in the future of what made your game better than LDoE at the start !!!!! Truly an excellent game !!!!\n\nUPDATE : After the latest update 0.9.8, my save file has reverted to a month ago. All my progress in the past month or so is lost. Almost 2000 coins, 14 rings, a ton of oats and oak, not to mention a lot of weapons and steel and high end clothes - ALL GONE. No word from the developer yet.

I’m guess they are paid for reviews and reviews from devs. I gave the game 3 stars and I think that is a honest and generous amount considering. Let’s start with clothing. Clothing doesn’t drop for squat and it wears out so fast it’s almost a pointless addition to the game, same with weapons and tools.  considering they want real money for chests that may give you a random items that will last you one mission or more if your lucky. Now let’s talk travel. You get 3 chances to run to your locations after that it’s 20 minutes to walk anywhere so in other words it’s almost impossible to get much done in one sit down. \n  \n In a nut shell this game screams give us your money idiots and we are gonna give you as little as possible in return. I find this sad, games like this have such great potential but are always made by greedy people so they are broken from the day it launches. My advise don’t waste your money just play once in a while when your measly energy cap is filled and shoot for lvl power and say F the clothing. Don’t give them a dime till they give us more time to play and have fun for free.\n\n   Actually clothing back in the day was made better then it is now.

Sick of the survival games all being against zombies so figured I’d try this game. I just started playing the game. Still low lvl only lvl 5 but so far there’s 2 big things that irk the hell out of me. One problem is functional and the another is aesthetic. \nFirst problem, your hunger and thirst meters don’t show while ur running around playing the game. U have to go into the inventory menu view to see the hunger and thirst meters which is highly annoying. Seems like a no brained that your hunger and thirst meters should show next to the health meter without having to go into a menu to view them. Duh.\nSecond problem is just aesthetic but also seems like a common sense thing as well. For some reason u can only play as a pale old white guy. U can change ur player name but apparently u can’t change anything about how ur player looks. So every humanoid character in the game all seems pale white males. U should give people the options of changing their characters sex, skin color, hair color, maybe even hair style. \nAlso, side note but a bit disappointed to see there’s zombies in the game. I’m so over that trope. You’d think there would b enough options for enemies in an old west setting without having to resort to dumb zombies but I guess not.","title":"2 problems right from the start","userName":"Deafgirlnamiko"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6352876200","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-08-23T17:23:27Z","developerResponse":{"id":18322090,"body":"Good day.

But after this new update its Ridiculous and frustrating. There is no way you can do daily quests because all of them are set in ash and maple. It use to be hard before in those locations now it’s just insane you can’t even look in a bag without 20+ guys on you that just keep appearing. You go through so many guns, clothes and meds and still don’t find the 3 pieces of the map before you die over and over. Then with an hour and 45 min time limit, it’s not happening. I agree with a lot of other reviews, with losing stuff so Frequently now it takes way to much to make new stuff and the fact that you have to go to these places that are insanely crazy with bad guys to TRY to get more items it’s very frustrating. Not even mention the fact that your items diminishes so quickly now. I have a screen shot of ash with 35 Xs around me and I didn’t even leave that little area between the water, they just kept coming and I still didn’t find any maps. PLEASE put it back to the way it was or a little harder but not this insane!!!! I love this game and would like to continue playing but it’s not worth it if it’s insanely hard to do anything.

It takes FOUR to make one lousy bar of steel...FOUR!  But still we grind.  And what do we get from our lazy devs?  Oooooooo...Christmas trees...ooooooo...don’t bother expanding to other areas...decorating Christmas trees in the Wild West is why we all showed up!  Do us a favor, stop trying to polish what was already great...work harder on expanding the world!

It WAS by far the most enjoyable of the survival type games out there. However, the developers seem to be on the profit driven quest. The updates are the biggest headaches of this game. First, it takes months to incorporate features that are “ in the game but not yet available” and when they do they decide to change some other aspect of gameplay for seemingly no other reason other than to force you to spend money. I began regularly purchasing the monthly VIP to make gameplay more enjoyable and to support the game. This provides gameplay perks as well as in- game currency. After one of their recent buggy updates all the in game currency I had saved in my inbox mysteriously vanished. Contacted the developers on multiple channels just to wait weeks for a “ tell us your problem” response followed by weeks of silence. If your looking for something to pass the time that’s not aliens and zombies, by all means download this game. However, I would HIGHLY suggest you save your hard earned money for a game with less bugs and the developers actually follow up with your issues in a timely manner. If you notice all the lower ratings are from veteran players so that should be a red flag. Until they can work out the bugs, my money will go to another game.","title":"Keep your money!","userName":"robbed by bugs"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4593450296","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-08-10T00:17:39Z","rating":5,"review":"If all the survival type games like this I’ve played, none have reached the end user -gamers like us, in such a fashion.  A wise woman once said, if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at at.  Thus, my first time taking an opportunity to rate or review a game.  Prior to the recent and most appreciated update, this game finally brought an answer to likewise games - health goes up with level and make resources attainable without getting duped into spending $.  Then out of nowhere an ingenious update comes that triples the engagement of the game by eliminating wasted steps and streamlining the process to progress to higher levels of the game.  After downloading, playing and deleting 200+ games on my phone, this is the only one deserving of my referral.  Kudos to developers and the team behind the scenes.  Side note, rarely do I spend $ on phone games but I have purchased twice into this one out of sheer gratitude to those that put in the time to create a long term, engaging and entertaining experience.

Much more variety and it’s prettier to look at. Great little survival game. The problem is in the timers. They’re punishing. It makes a grinding game a grindcore game and you really can’t get ahead. What made LDOE so great was that it seemed fair. I respected the devs for that. I watched lots of ads and actually spent a good amount of money on LDOE, because their free to play model felt like I was being treated with respect. This game doesn’t do that. The timers make it extremely difficult to stay interested long enough to see if I want to spend actual money. The crafting requirements are equally odious. You will never have enough raw materials to craft with and actually enjoy the game. It’s too bad. I really can see spending time with this one, but I get frustrated to the point of rage quitting. Lol\n There’s also a bug in combat that is a killer. There’s a huge delay and freeze when you are trying to swig any melee weapon. It makes for a quick death and renders the stealth option useless about half the time. \n If the timers get fixed, it’ll be a good game, and if they fix the crafting requirements too? It’ll be a great game.","title":"This is not LDOE","userName":"Dusty but,"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3821931036","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-02-27T21:55:30Z","developerResponse":{"id":7585107,"body":"Hello!

The 4 stars is based on the redundancy of the game because you are always farming the same things and re-invading the same areas countless times just to get into another area that you can raid only one time. The basic things you need in the game are always in demand and it takes a long time to get what you need. The advanced stuff is so difficult compared to the basics to get and gather that I would recommend a little balancing. Look forward to see what they have in store and what the game has in store. Could be awesome and thank you for a good game.\n\nUpdate - 2/25: This new update made me put then game down today for the first time ever. Spent a couple months learning the game and upgrading (over half my house is stone) what I learned worked. Found the best hand weapon and rifle combo that I could repair. Have not died in weeks except one time when I was not watching my thirst. Today I died twice including once against a bear and NPC when I had my best hand weapon and was at almost full health. My resources are being sucked up quicker than I can make them and I don’t trust to put it on autopilot after today’s update.
