      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Overall I like the app. I get that contracts limit to the last 5 episodes, though in the modern age of episodic TV having fall finales I wish they would release the early season episodes to streaming services in smaller chunks to let us get caught up and finish the show on the app.<br /><br />However my first complaint / reason for a drop of a star is that unlike other streaming apps, this one maintains the main iOS screen saver settings. When I use my phone normally I want it to lock automatically after a short period of me not touching it ... but if I’m watching an hour long show casted to my TV I don’t want to touch my phone for an hour, and definitely not every 2 minutes.<br />Also, either the setting to go from one episode to the next doesn’t exist or it isn’t obvious / intuitive. Other streaming apps auto-forward too quickly (I sometimes like the music and some movies have post-credit scenes), but to not have the option to skip to next or automatically advance at the end also seems outdated.<br />Other streaming video apps have these issues figured out, more or less, and they seem tome to be things that need to be priorities.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app is incomprehensibly bad, at least as far as how it displays when holding the iPad in different orientations. For starters, when you open the app, it only supports portrait orientation, with the home button at the bottom. Now let’s be clear about something. We are watching a video, the only way to watch it is in landscape orientation. And that is exactly how the videos will play, but before you can watch them, you have to browse the selection screen with iPad held upright in portrait orientation. That is incomprehensibly ridiculous. Why wouldn’t you want to browse the listings in the same orientation as you are going to watch them in? As it is, the iPad is often easier to hold in landscape orientation. And it’s not like there isn’t an existing CW app that is used exclusively in landscape orientation. Hello Apple TV!<br /><br />But this gets better. Sometimes I have to have my iPad in landscape orientation with the home button on the left side, so I can have it plugged in while I’m watching something. And while the actual videos “can” play oriented correctly regardless of which side is up, when you pause a video, it will resume upside down if your iPad is held (or on a stand in my case) with the home button is on the left. And of course, when you exit a video, the home screen for the app is sideways.<br /><br />You would think the developers of The CW app have not actually used it themselves. It’s just that incomprehensibly absurd in the way it works.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The first thing is there are way too many ads. Ok so I get you have to have ads to have a free app, but can’t you make it so if I was at a part after an ad I don’t have to go through all the ads. I mean every 6-12 minutes there is a series of 6 ads and not even different ones. Usually they are almost exactly the same as the last series of ads I watched. It’s soooo annoying. Second thing is that they app only has the last 5 episodes of the tv series. So if I want to watch a new series that has 10 episodes I have to find the first 5 episodes on other apps or websites and it’s quite annoying. I usually end up using other apps/websites instead of this one for these reasons. I know you can’t get rid of all ads and maybe you can’t even make every episode of a show available but it would be nice to not have sooo many ads and at least AT LEAST the 10 latest episodes of a tv series. I suggest to only use this app if you have patience for ads and you are on the lasted 5 episodes of a show. So honestly only download this if you don’t have another app that has your favorite shows.</p>

The CW Network is a joint venture between Warner Bros. Entertainment and CBS Corporation (collectively \"we\" or \"us\"). Your privacy is important to us. To help protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the collection and use of the personally identifiable information collected on our online and mobile websites, services, and applications (“Site” or “Sites”). By using the Sites, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your personal information as described in this notice.\n\nFor certain offerings on our Sites, there may be additional notices about information practices and choices. Please read those additional privacy disclosures to understand how they apply to you. \n\nTHE INFORMATION WE COLLECT\n\nRegistration and account information. At some Sites, you can order products, play games, read and submit reviews, enter contests, vote in polls, view and rate videos, TV shows and other content, or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that you provide as part of your account may include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card and billing information, information about your interest in and use of various content, products, programs, and services, and other information that you provide to us.  In the course of using our Sites, we may ask you to create an account or register for an application by providing us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you, as well as to administer your account.\n\nInformation about others/inviting friends. At some of our Sites, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to share content or recommendations, send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people as part of this process include recipient's name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and information about the recipient’s interest in and use of various content, products, programs, and services. \n\nSome of our Sites also allow you to invite your friends to join our services and to connect with you through social media features. Inviting friends is always optional. To do so, you may provide their contact information or may enter your log-in credentials to import e-mail addresses or usernames from your address book from other sites that support such functionality (e.g., Yahoo!, Gmail, Facebook). You select the friends you want to invite to share in this experience.\n\nInformation from other sources. We may, on occasion, combine information we receive online with outside records and use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, such as to enhance our ability to market to you products or services that may be of interest to you. \n\nSocial media. You can also engage with our content and other offerings, such as videos, contests, games and activities, on or through third-party social media sites, plug-ins and applications, such as those offered by Facebook and others. You may also choose to link your account with us to third party social media sites. When you link your account or engage with our content on or through third party social media sites, services, plug-ins, or applications you may allow us to have ongoing access to certain information from your social media account (e.g., name, e-mail address, profile photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends and their contact information, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the 'likes' you make). We may also receive non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on, etc.) from your interaction with our content. \n\nWhen you provide information to a Site from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (i) give you exclusive content, (ii) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Sites, and (iii) contact you through the social media sites or directly with the latest news, special offerings, and rewards. By providing such information, you consent to the use of the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. \n\nIf you post information or content, such as by posting photos, commenting on a blog, or participating in chat functions or online forums or communities at our Sites, or when you interact with our Sites through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, depending on your privacy settings, this information may become public on the Internet. Therefore, we cannot prevent further use of this information. You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. For more information about how you can customize your privacy settings and how third party social media sites handle your personally identifiable information, please refer to their privacy help guides, privacy policies and terms of use.\n\nInformation collection from mobile devices. If you access our Sites, on your mobile telephone or other mobile device, we also may collect your unique device identifier and mobile device IP address (e.g. MAC address), as well as information about your device’s operating system, mobile carrier, and mobile Internet browsers, your precise location information, and other information described in this Policy. \n\nTechnical and usage information. We also collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you use our Sites, including when you view content and videos on our Sites, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows, Mac OS, iOS, and Android), the domain name of your Internet service provider or mobile carrier, IP address, device ID and other technical attributes related to your device, and certain usage information.  For example, some content on our Sites is limited to users in the United States and the US territories. Your device IP address is tested by the Site so that The CW can determine whether you are located in the United States or the US territories.\n\nProviding requested information. In some cases, only persons who provide us with the requested  information will be able to order products, programs, and services, or otherwise participate in the Site's activities and offerings. \n\nHOW WE USE THE INFORMATION \n\nProviding our products and services. We use the information we collect about you to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, to develop, provide, maintain, support, personalize, protect, and improve our offerings and to offer you other products, programs or services from us and our affiliates, business partners, and selected third parties that we believe may be of interest to you. \n\nThe information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services. \n\nIf you choose to submit content for publication, we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us on our Sites, the Internet, or elsewhere. \n\nCommunicating with you. We use information about you to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our user agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter or other service, to confirm purchases you have made through our Sites, or to contact you about your account with us. You may also choose to receive push notifications from us on your mobile device.\n\nWe use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them invitations, gifts, cards, or other content on your behalf or through our Sites. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer products, programs, or services to them.\n\nWith consent. We may also use your information for any other purposes pursuant to your consent or at your direction.\n\nUse of mobile device data. When you access our Sites on a mobile device, we may use the information collected for any of the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy. For example, we use information collected on mobile devices to enable you to do things like (i) watch trailers and video clips, (ii) get entertainment news and updates, (iii) get information about comics, movies, TV shows, (iv) to locate and access personalized information or functionality based on your location (e.g., find comic stores or show times for theaters near you, tag photographs, or check in to a certain venue), (v) buy movie tickets, (vi) play games, (vii) follow blogs, and (viii) read critic and user reviews. We may also use this information to offer you products, programs and services we believe may be of interest to you and otherwise tailor your experience. \n\nUse of non-personally identifiable information. We use aggregate information about our users and non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design, functionality and content of our Sites and to enable us to personalize your experience with our Sites and offerings. We also use this information to (i) develop, provide, maintain, support, personalize, protect, and improve our products, programs, and services and to operate our business, (ii) to analyze usage and performance of our Sites, and (iii) for us and our affiliates, business partners, and selected third parties to communicate with you, advertise to you and offer you products, programs, or services. \n\nINFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE\n\nLegal Process, Law Enforcement, and Corporate Transactions. We and our agents, contractors, and service providers may disclose information we maintain when required to do so by applicable US or other law, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, legal process, or other claim or inquiry. We also may disclose such information in response to a US or other law enforcement agency’s request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, and to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Sites and applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by US or other law or legal requirements. In addition, we may transfer information about our visitors in the event of a business transaction or reorganization, such as if we or one of our business units or our relevant assets are reorganized, acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company.\n\nService providers. Our agents, contractors and other service providers may have access information, including personally identifiable information to help carry out the services they are performing for us. \n\nAffiliates and other third parties. We may disclose information, including personally identifiable information about you to companies whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share such information we collect with our affiliates to provide, improve and communicate with you about their own products and services.  A list of affiliates of Warner Bros. Entertainment is available in the WARNER BROS. AFFILIATES section below.  A list of affiliates of CBS Corporation is available at www.cbscorporation.com/portfolio.php. \n\nWe may also share such information with business partners and third parties (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, application developers, participatory databases and non-profit organizations) that want to market products or services to you. If we share personally identifiable information with such unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses. \n\nLinked sites. Some of our Sites contain links to other sites, services, and applications whose information practices may be different from ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy policies before submitting any information, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. \n\nSponsors, joint-offerings and co-promotions. We sometimes may offer content or programs (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications or social network integrations) that are sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information, which is covered by their own privacy policies. The Site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.\n\nAdvertising. At some of our Sites, reputable third parties may present or serve advertisements, provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and site analytics, and assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit, or set their own cookies. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Privacy Policy. They may also obtain information about other applications that you have downloaded to your computer or mobile device, the sites you visit, and other information about you or your computer or device in order to help analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the Site and elsewhere. For more information about third party ad networks at our Sites and your ability to opt-out of targeted advertising from such third parties, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative (www.networkadvertising.org) and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising (www.aboutads.info/choices). Please note that opting-out through these programs will stop certain targeted advertising, but will still allow the collection of usage data for some purposes, including research, analytics and internal operations.\n\nWith consent.

We, and our affiliates, third party service providers, and our business partners may send \"cookies\" to your computer or use similar technologies to support and enhance your online experience at our Sites, including by helping us collect and understand usage and performance information and to display and measure advertisements. For example, \"cookies\" are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information (including click through and click stream data). Cookies manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us and/or other networks or sites. Cookies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser).\n\nSome of our Sites may use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as \"Flash cookies\") to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation. Adobe's Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies.

Web beacons (or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. \n\nWhen corresponding with you via HTML capable email, web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our email.\n\nOn their own, cookies or web beacons generally do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/web beacons.\n\nManaging cookies and web beacons and Do Not Track. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and web beacons as described herein. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website.

Please consult the \"Help\" section of your browser for more information. However, certain areas of our Sites can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Site features. We do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.\n\nFor more information about cookies and how browser settings can be changed to reject them, you should go to your web browser’s Help menu. \n\nGoogle Analytics, one of our service providers, provides its own opt-out process.

When I use my phone normally I want it to lock automatically after a short period of me not touching it ... but if I’m watching an hour long show casted to my TV I don’t want to touch my phone for an hour, and definitely not every 2 minutes.\nAlso, either the setting to go from one episode to the next doesn’t exist or it isn’t obvious / intuitive. Other streaming apps auto-forward too quickly (I sometimes like the music and some movies have post-credit scenes), but to not have the option to skip to next or automatically advance at the end also seems outdated.\nOther streaming video apps have these issues figured out, more or less, and they seem tome to be things that need to be priorities.","title":"Needs settings","userName":"Tom_ATC"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4199716518","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-05-24T06:31:09Z","rating":1,"review":"This app is incomprehensibly bad, at least as far as how it displays when holding the iPad in different orientations. For starters, when you open the app, it only supports portrait orientation, with the home button at the bottom. Now let’s be clear about something. We are watching a video, the only way to watch it is in landscape orientation. And that is exactly how the videos will play, but before you can watch them, you have to browse the selection screen with iPad held upright in portrait orientation. That is incomprehensibly ridiculous. Why wouldn’t you want to browse the listings in the same orientation as you are going to watch them in? As it is, the iPad is often easier to hold in landscape orientation. And it’s not like there isn’t an existing CW app that is used exclusively in landscape orientation. Hello Apple TV!\n\nBut this gets better. Sometimes I have to have my iPad in landscape orientation with the home button on the left side, so I can have it plugged in while I’m watching something. And while the actual videos “can” play oriented correctly regardless of which side is up, when you pause a video, it will resume upside down if your iPad is held (or on a stand in my case) with the home button is on the left. And of course, when you exit a video, the home screen for the app is sideways.\n\nYou would think the developers of The CW app have not actually used it themselves. It’s just that incomprehensibly absurd in the way it works.","title":"Horribly bad orientation controls","userName":"$1K Master"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3542213026","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-12-17T19:59:57Z","rating":3,"review":"The first thing is there are way too many ads. Ok so I get you have to have ads to have a free app, but can’t you make it so if I was at a part after an ad I don’t have to go through all the ads. I mean every 6-12 minutes there is a series of 6 ads and not even different ones. Usually they are almost exactly the same as the last series of ads I watched. It’s soooo annoying. Second thing is that they app only has the last 5 episodes of the tv series. So if I want to watch a new series that has 10 episodes I have to find the first 5 episodes on other apps or websites and it’s quite annoying. I usually end up using other apps/websites instead of this one for these reasons. I know you can’t get rid of all ads and maybe you can’t even make every episode of a show available but it would be nice to not have sooo many ads and at least AT LEAST the 10 latest episodes of a tv series. I suggest to only use this app if you have patience for ads and you are on the lasted 5 episodes of a show.

It usually allows a week to 3 weeks or so to watch an episode after it airs.

I’m glad I was able to watch the Crisis on Infinite Earths series without having to resort to a less than reputable streaming site, but the app makes me really want to again. The iPad version of the app only allows you to browse in portrait, but goes to landscape when playing a video. It does not, however, let you switch landscape orientations.\n\nThe ads are also extremely annoying. I get they need ad revenue to continue making money and the shows, but play some different ads. Don’t play the same set of 3-5 ads for the whole episode. It’s also very buggy when it comes to resuming an episode. I already watched your annoying ads. Don’t force me to watch them again to get back to the point I was at. Sometimes it will even start me back to the previous part of the video I already watched before the ads. Then I have to skip back to the point I was at only to be shown the exact same ads! People want to watch the content legally, but the lengthy repetitive ads and bugs make you want to go find it elsewhere for free with no ads.

Sometimes the Ads will run over the show, and I will miss 5 minute increments at a time because the ads play simultaneously and do not pause and start the show. This is a technical problem, but I also have a problem with the ads themselves. I have no control over the ads I see, and your ads often make me uncomfortable and even am often repulsed, as they deal with many thing completely irrelevant to me or expose me to topics that gross me out. It ruins the interest in your shows and the amount of time I am willing to commit and the more it occurs, the less I feel secure in your app. \nThis can and should be remedied by allowing users to elect content of sponsors, or choose from a list of preselected topics at the very least. I honestly wouldn’t even mind seeing the same previews on repeat, so long as I do not have to see the rest of it at all. This allows you to better improve your demographic information as well, so I don’t see why it isn’t already an option, at the very least when you set up the account.","title":"Current issues","userName":"Aria Riopolos"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4111565513","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-05-07T00:53:23Z","rating":4,"review":"I am fine with ads, if I wanted no ads I would have just gone and purchased what I want to watch. However the ads need to be quicker maybe 3 min max, and change it up, the same ad 10 times in one 40 minute episode (I’m exaggerating) is hell, and makes it seem even longer.\n\nPlease fix programming or whatever, I am never sent back to where I was watching when I hit continue, sometimes it won’t let me hit play when I answer a text. It’s obnoxious and I have to restart the app.\n\n⚡️Overall, I like the shows they are great, for me the quality of viewing is great. I think that considering that this is a free app, with free streaming of the most recent episodes of shows, that others should cut The CW some slack. Yes there are issues that can be fixed/improved, but over all very good for free. For other viewers I recommend watching shows in one sitting, or remembering the time you stopped watching. For The CW I recommend fixing some of the glitches of your app, but great job, on the shows concepts, I love the plots.","title":"Okay, could be much better","userName":"liaxe"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4254329136","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-06-02T23:36:22Z","rating":3,"review":"There’s definitely issues but it’s a free streaming service so we can’t complain that much. Sometimes it’s becomes very blurry , commercials are very long, there’s no resume button so if you stop streaming and then go back you have to remember where you stopped or just rewatch the whole thing. Which is sometimes easier because otherwise you’ll watch like 6 minutes of commercials before you get back to your spot. All that I can deal with. most recently I’ve been having a new problem that’s never occurred before. I stream to my tv thru my chrome cast but now as soon as my phone screen locks, it completely kicks me off. Which is like two minutes. I can’t minimize the app because the same thing happens. I have to reconnect and start all over. Not an issue with the internet or chrome cast because Netflix/Hulu work just fine. This maybe started last week. I like a lot of the shows but trying to keep my phone screen active on the cw app screen for 50 minutes is a lot of effort for no reason really, even for a free app.","title":"It is free but","userName":"jdkdhruepwsbdge"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3489586431","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-12-03T17:01:02Z","rating":4,"review":"I don’t know which version the bug occurred, but there is an option to skip the credits and roll into the next episode, as watching several in consecutive order, and it seems the audio track continues to play, while the video bumps to the next episode.  Once the previous episode ends the track, the next episode begins, along with the audio track for the new episode, so ends up with a fairly garbled track, although there are two distinct tracks playing on top of the other.  Otherwise, as we have a busy life, this is a great alternative to watching my DC shows live-play, as I can catch the last few weeks’ worth, as time allows.  This occurred a couple of months ago, and was just figured out to be what the issue is that is occurring.  I have not, as yet, tried to reinstall the app, but it has been occurring on both of our Apple TV modules, so not sure if it was a glitch that just hadn’t gotten bumped out by a bug fix or if it’s just never been noticed by anyone else.","title":"Apple TV bug","userName":"Pinaden"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5885873581","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-30T23:09:55Z","rating":1,"review":"But the controls and swiping are inconsistent. Episodes air but don’t appear on the app. No landscape mode for browsing, only during play back. Episodes sometimes in ascending, sometimes in descending order. Way too many ads. It’s like they took everything BAD about broadcast television and stuck it in an app. Whatever geriatric individual is overseeing the development and management of this app, they need to have their children play with it and tell them how to fix it. Anyone with experience in using media apps could tell you the UI and UX is outdated. It’s as if my grandparents made a major media company’s app, and they’re dead.\n\nEdit: tried it again. It was worse than before. I shut down the app , deleted it from my iPad, while casting, and it is STILL casting to my Chromecast. How is this even possible? Had to literally disconnect my Chromecast. I had already watched the commercials before casting, and as soon as I began to cast I had to sit thru another batch of commercials? I immediately deleted it. You have some shows I love, but now they will suffer in viewership from a long time (7 years) fan. I’ll watch them on Netflix when they come out. Sad.
