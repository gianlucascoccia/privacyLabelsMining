      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been a subscribing customer since the Roomie days. And now with the boom of home automation and IoT devices, this app has taken on a whole new life!  I recently upgraded to Simple Control 5 so I could control my A/V with Alexa voice commands. Upgrading was a learning curve, but that’s to be expected with a major app overhaul. Works great!  Love the new interface (now that I’m used to is). But you must have a dedicated iDevice (I&#39;m using an old iPhone 6s) as your Simple Control. Even though I’m very tech literate, it took a bit of finagling to get it working. But it does work. Just stick with it, read the help forums, and email Simple Control support, who are super responsive!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been a user of this service/app and while it does involve a learning curve, the investment of your time to configure the platform is well worth it.  They have a comprehensive setup guide and compatibility chart which was very helpful.  Most of the configuration is intuitive through a visual interface.<br /><br />As far as competitors - I think Simple Control is the perfect balance between customizable and ease of configuration.  Other solutions I have research are far lacking the range of devices supported and in a world of new tech constantly entering the market, I can count on Simple Control to integrate into the platform.  Other solutions I have seen require some coding or large investment with little flexibility to make quick changes.<br /><br />There are many bad reviews around the time of a re-vamp.  I agree the solution was garbage when the transition to version 5 occurred.  They have since released many improvements which makes the app way more stable and powerful than the original. 4 stars because there is still some room for improving panel design customization and adding more overall color to the look.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This product has been around for a while. The developer has a little trouble making up his mind what to call it -- Roomie Remote, Simple Home, Simple Control... it&#39;s tough to understand that direction. On the surfact, it looks to be a great idea -- integrated IP remote of all your home components. Just don&#39;t expect any decent documentaiton on exactly HOW a particular device is integrated or WHAT you have to do to make it work. Don&#39;t bother with the user-to-user forum -- the developer &quot;moderates&quot; all negative discussion or questions to the recyle bin. Facebook? Stock photos and pitches that are over a year old and all requests for help deleted with &quot;contact Support through the app&quot; responses. And then, there&#39;s that: Contacting &quot;support&quot; through the app results in evasive non-answers and &quot;your question is closed&quot; responses when you actually ask how a device is supposed to work. If you can figure this out entirely on your own, you may like it. Just don&#39;t expect any reasonable/understandable answers from the developer, who appears to be spending most of his time deleting users comments on all available forums.</p>

And now with the boom of home automation and IoT devices, this app has taken on a whole new life!  I recently upgraded to Simple Control 5 so I could control my A/V with Alexa voice commands. Upgrading was a learning curve, but that’s to be expected with a major app overhaul. Works great!  Love the new interface (now that I’m used to is). But you must have a dedicated iDevice (I'm using an old iPhone 6s) as your Simple Control. Even though I’m very tech literate, it took a bit of finagling to get it working. But it does work. Just stick with it, read the help forums, and email Simple Control support, who are super responsive!","title":"Almost perfect","userName":"Jhanrahan82"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3737687490","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-02-06T01:05:00Z","rating":5,"review":"I have been a user of this service/app and while it does involve a learning curve, the investment of your time to configure the platform is well worth it.  They have a comprehensive setup guide and compatibility chart which was very helpful.  Most of the configuration is intuitive through a visual interface.\n\nAs far as competitors - I think Simple Control is the perfect balance between customizable and ease of configuration.  Other solutions I have research are far lacking the range of devices supported and in a world of new tech constantly entering the market, I can count on Simple Control to integrate into the platform.  Other solutions I have seen require some coding or large investment with little flexibility to make quick changes.\n\nThere are many bad reviews around the time of a re-vamp.  I agree the solution was garbage when the transition to version 5 occurred.  They have since released many improvements which makes the app way more stable and powerful than the original. 4 stars because there is still some room for improving panel design customization and adding more overall color to the look.","title":"A must have Smart Home Solution","userName":"HandyAl86"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4353732816","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-06-22T16:46:39Z","rating":1,"review":"This product has been around for a while. The developer has a little trouble making up his mind what to call it -- Roomie Remote, Simple Home, Simple Control... it's tough to understand that direction. On the surfact, it looks to be a great idea -- integrated IP remote of all your home components. Just don't expect any decent documentaiton on exactly HOW a particular device is integrated or WHAT you have to do to make it work. Don't bother with the user-to-user forum -- the developer \"moderates\" all negative discussion or questions to the recyle bin. Facebook? Stock photos and pitches that are over a year old and all requests for help deleted with \"contact Support through the app\" responses. And then, there's that: Contacting \"support\" through the app results in evasive non-answers and \"your question is closed\" responses when you actually ask how a device is supposed to work. If you can figure this out entirely on your own, you may like it.

I did start out with the original Roomie program, I feel this version could be better once the bugs are worked out. They need a video tutorial with step by step instructions. Along with simple written instructions. Read, Read and read again to make sure you understand how this program is set up and works. The last issue is family sharing this in its self is a joke.
