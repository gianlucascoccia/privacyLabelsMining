      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I started with BodyRockers about 8 years ago after my first daughter was born. It helped me get back into shape and keep me motivated while I was home. I’ve used on and off ever since. I would like to stay more on top of my workouts but I do find it hard sometimes now that I have my third child. But the workouts are super effective and I can find short videos that I can usually squeeze in. The one thing I was wish was different was that the videos in collections were better labeled. For example, the Beginner Boot Camp is difficult to find the right day when I stream from my fire stick. I have to count the days and find the video and it would be nice to see it at a glance. I definitely enjoy my workouts. I’m hoping to add some gear this year!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I been working out with Body Rock for a year. It is absolutely the best quality workout you can find on the internet, gym instruction, and almost anywhere without paying an arm-and-leg for. I would highly recommend it for anyone to try. <br />Start out with the introductory challenges if you’re new to working out and ramp it up to the longer workouts when your ready. <br />They premier several trainers, but the favorites are Sean and Lisa. When you’re ready for a longer workout with heavy weights, go to Lisa’s Lives. If you want a shorter workout with more bouncing, stability challenges, and loads of ab work then go to Sean.  Of course, mix and match or try other trainers or different styles: yoga, pregnancy, etc...  It’s all there. Give it a try! What do you have to lose? Maybe some weight.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve always been active and have always loved exercise. I’ve purchased many exercise programs, power 90, beach body, etc. Those always got boring and I hated it when the leader would stop the exercise to critique the form of the others on the camera. SweatFlix has so many different options and trainers. You can basically pick a workout that you’re in the mood for. I’m loyal to Lisa. I love her workouts, her personality, encouragement, jokes and dance moves. I’ve been doing her workouts for a year now and I’m not bored. She has kept me motivated and she’s right when she says to trust the process because I see results that I haven’t seen before. I’m healthier now in my 40s than I ever was in my 20s. I know I put in the work but she keeps me going. She’s the BEST trainer ever!!!!</p>

It helped me get back into shape and keep me motivated while I was home. I’ve used on and off ever since. I would like to stay more on top of my workouts but I do find it hard sometimes now that I have my third child. But the workouts are super effective and I can find short videos that I can usually squeeze in. The one thing I was wish was different was that the videos in collections were better labeled. For example, the Beginner Boot Camp is difficult to find the right day when I stream from my fire stick. I have to count the days and find the video and it would be nice to see it at a glance. I definitely enjoy my workouts.

It is absolutely the best quality workout you can find on the internet, gym instruction, and almost anywhere without paying an arm-and-leg for. I would highly recommend it for anyone to try. \nStart out with the introductory challenges if you’re new to working out and ramp it up to the longer workouts when your ready. \nThey premier several trainers, but the favorites are Sean and Lisa. When you’re ready for a longer workout with heavy weights, go to Lisa’s Lives. If you want a shorter workout with more bouncing, stability challenges, and loads of ab work then go to Sean.  Of course, mix and match or try other trainers or different styles: yoga, pregnancy, etc...  It’s all there. Give it a try! What do you have to lose? Maybe some weight.","title":"Best workout you’ll find","userName":"AnnaDager"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5465023855","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-01-30T06:55:48Z","rating":5,"review":"I’ve always been active and have always loved exercise.

I love her workouts, her personality, encouragement, jokes and dance moves. I’ve been doing her workouts for a year now and I’m not bored. She has kept me motivated and she’s right when she says to trust the process because I see results that I haven’t seen before. I’m healthier now in my 40s than I ever was in my 20s.

If I’m currently working through a collection or particular bootcamp, there is no way to see what videos I’ve already done, and no easy way to access the set I’m working through on the homepage. There’s a “Continue Watching” section for videos I might be half-way through or have accidentally started/stopped, but, that’s it. \n\nI would love to be able to continue with a program each new day and not have to search from scratch / try to remember what day I was previously on. In addition, it would be awesome if I could save my favorites, make my own video playlists, etc. \n\nOverall my issues come down to navigation, various lacking features, and the layout of the app itself.
