      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>People need to understand that this is an extremely new iOS app and a new streaming service in general. It’s legit but has a way to go and that’s to be expected. VRV has offered this as part of it’s service as a dub alternative to crunchroll’s sub library ever since Funimation got stingy and backed out within like a year of their deal. With Funimation being such money-grabbers, it’s this or nothing. So the fact that they’re actually keeping their word and bringing a primitive port of the app to both iOS and PS4 is great news to me and I’ve been waiting a while. Expect the library to be small but gradually grow. Expect the app to need work and likely receive it (hopefully.) I’ve kept up with this company and I’ve seen first hand that it has a way to go to compete with Funimation, but I’m grateful someone’s trying.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Listen, I could ignore the terrible quality and playback issues that one has to put up with while using your app. I could even deal with the poor functionality of your app in it’s entirety because I am aware that it is very new. However, what I will not accept is signing up for a subscription, having your app crash while I am watching something and then telling me I need to subscribe again. I happened to get the 30 day free trial which my Apple account shows is STILL active, but for whatever asinine reason my account within your systems does not register this anymore. I’m not paying you up front for something that I was given a 30 day free trial for. I would like this fixed because what I am not going to do is pay for an app that does not have the functionality nor the quality to justify the money you ask for. This was the only streaming service I could find that allows me to watch a dubbed season of a specific show so I was willing to deal with the bugs while you guys figured it all out, but not this. There isn’t even a way to contact someone about my issue and your help page is unhelpful, which is why I am taking to this review. I’m not paying you when I was told I’d get it free for 30 days, it’s literally only been 30 minutes.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Rarely works for any of the titles. And when it doesn’t the video formatting is terrible. All of the negative reviews are spot on. And their app team doesn’t seem to give a crap about fixing it. I love pretty much all anime and that’s what got me to jump at the subscription, however this is the worst streaming service I’ve tried. I feel like a moron for jumping at the discounted year subscription.  Most titles aren’t available through any app not just iOS. The ones that are won’t play. “Stream not found”. Customer service is a joke. “We’ve tried to recreate the issue but haven’t had any luck.”, is their standard response. I’ve tried the apps on multiple devices from iPads to Xbox to play stations. All have terribly clunky video streaming when it works. Constantly having to delete the apps and reinstall. No way to just restart a video from the beginning. It’s the modern equivalent of having to rewind a vhs. This isn’t some new technology. Video streaming has been up and running for over a decade. The beta for Netflix was 100% better than this. At this point it feels like they are just jerking people around. Definitely not renewing my subscription.</p>

However, when you leave our site or click links to affiliated Service Providers including, by way of example, our e-commerce affiliates, they may collect information about you to conduct business with you, to transact with you and/or to otherwise interact with you. Their policies may differ from ours.\n\nYour information may be shared with:\n\nService Providers. Service Providers are third parties with whom we may work to offer products and Services such as our e-commerce affiliates. You can tell when you are accessing a Service offered by a Service Provider because the Service Provider's name will be featured prominently. You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a Service offered by a Service Provider. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both us and the Service Provider, or we may share your information with the Service Provider. Please note that the Service Provider's privacy policy may apply to its use of your information.\nSocial Media Advertising Networks. We may share information about you with social media networks to allow for the delivery of customized advertising about products and Services that you may be interested in. We provide this information to the social media network so they can deliver the ad to the right social media user. The delivery of customized social media ads, and your ability to opt-out of receiving those ads, is governed by the privacy policies of the social media companies who deliver customized ads to you.\nCorporate Affiliates.

These aggregate statistics will not allow anyone to identify your name or other personal information.\nWe May Share Your Information with Other Third Parties:\n\nPursuant to Legal Requirements. We will disclose your personal information in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement agency or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.\nTo Protect Our Website and Users. We will disclose your personal information when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our employees, our website users or others; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.\nIn Connection with Business Transfers. We may share your personal information as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or court order or in the unlikely event of a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of HIDIVE or our affiliates, a merger, consolidation, asset sale or bankruptcy.\nCHILDREN’S PRIVACY\n\nOur Services are not addressed toward individuals under the age of 18 (“Children”). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from Children. While individuals under the age of 18 may utilize the service, they may do so only with the involvement, supervision, and approval of a parent or legal guardian.\n\nIf you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children have provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers. Please contact us at: abuse@HIDIVE.COM or privacy@HIDIVE.COM\n\nDATA SECURITY INTEGRITY AND RETENTION\n\nThe security and confidentiality of user information are extremely important to us. We utilize technical, physical and administrative measures that are intended to protect user information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure. We review periodically our security protocols which review can include updating those protocols to address changes in technology, methods and risks. However, be advised, that despite our best efforts, no protocol is perfect and no security measure can guarantee protection. We retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or otherwise to the extent permissible or required by applicable law.\n\nDATA PROTECTION\n\nWherever your personal information is processed, stored or transferred by us, we will take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of your personal information. We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please immediately notify us at privacy@HIDIVE.COM\n\nSENSITIVE DATA\n\nUnless specifically requested or required by law, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, on or through the Services or otherwise to us, any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, national identification number, data related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, ideological or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background, trade union membership, or administrative or criminal proceedings and sanctions).\n\nCROSS BORDER TRANSFER\n\nHIDIVE provides a global service. Sharing data cross-border is essential to the Services so that you receive the same high-quality service wherever you are in the world. As a result, we will, subject to law, transfer personal information and other data collected in connection with the Services, to entities in countries where data protection standards may differ from those in the country where you reside. By subscribing to our Services, using App’s or using any of the HIDIVE branded services, you understand that we transfer your personal information globally. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries will be entitled to access your personal information.\n\nCOOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LEGAL PROCESS\n\nWe intend to cooperate with valid private party requests, government and law enforcement requests for information made consistent with applicable law. The primary set of laws governing disclosure of user information is found in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701, et seq. (“ECPA”). Because the HIDIVE platform functions as an electronic communications service, ECPA mandates that we disclose certain user information only in response to specific types of government process, including subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants. Generally speaking, ECPA permits disclosure of basic user identity and log-in information in response to a subpoena, but requires a court order to disclose additional user records, or search warrant to authorize disclosure of any online communications (e.g. “chat”). The rules may differ also depending on whether law enforcement seeks information that has already been stored, or to capture information prospectively. We may disclose any information about you to private parties (responsive to valid process), government or law enforcement officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect our rights (or those of a third party), to enforce our terms of use, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, unlawful, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable.\n\nWe may change this Privacy Policy from time to time to address or accommodate technology changes, commercial practices, regulatory requirements and for other purposes.\nWe will provide notice to you to the extent the changes are material. We may also obtain your consent to changes to the extent required by applicable law.\nLINKS TO OTHER SITES\n\nOur sites and applications may provide links or offer re-directs to other sites and applications that are not operated by us and which are not governed by this Privacy Policy. We urge you to review and become familiar with the privacy policies and practices associated with those other sites and applications.\n\nYOUR CONTROLS AND PREFERENCES\n\nWe have enabled features for users to configure how certain information is made available through our social media services. These features are available within the My Account and My Profile sections of the site.\n\nACCOUNT PROFILES\n\nWe enable account holders to create unique profiles to enable a more customized viewing and user experience and to provide our Services in a manner that is relevant to each account holder and profile. If you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they will be able to view your information (including in some cases personal information) such as your watch history, ratings, settings, and account information (including your email address or other account information). Anyone you share or allow to access your account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles. You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not wish them to use or change your profile, it is your responsibility to address such matters with them.\n\nDEACTIVATING YOUR ACCOUNT\n\nIf the Site functionality permits, you can deactivate your account at any time by visiting the preferences page for your profile or delete any content you provide from the Site, though we may retain a copy of any deactivated accounts or deleted content for compliance purposes. When you deactivate your account, your user profiles will be disabled, but your public comments will remain on the site. The Site has no responsibility to take down, remove, or edit any of your public activities or any submissions that are a result of your public activities.

However, when you leave our site or click links to affiliated Service Providers including, by way of example, our e-commerce affiliates, they may collect information about you to conduct business with you, to transact with you and/or to otherwise interact with you. Their policies may differ from ours.\n\nYour information may be shared with:\n\nService Providers. Service Providers are third parties with whom we may work to offer products and Services such as our e-commerce affiliates. You can tell when you are accessing a Service offered by a Service Provider because the Service Provider's name will be featured prominently. You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a Service offered by a Service Provider. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both us and the Service Provider, or we may share your information with the Service Provider. Please note that the Service Provider's privacy policy may apply to its use of your information.\nSocial Media Advertising Networks. We may share information about you with social media networks to allow for the delivery of customized advertising about products and Services that you may be interested in.

We will disclose your personal information in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement agency or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.\nTo Protect Our Website and Users. We will disclose your personal information when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our employees, our website users or others; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.\nIn Connection with Business Transfers. We may share your personal information as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or court order or in the unlikely event of a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of HIDIVE or our affiliates, a merger, consolidation, asset sale or bankruptcy.\nCHILDREN’S PRIVACY\n\nOur Services are not addressed toward individuals under the age of 18 (“Children”). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from Children. While individuals under the age of 18 may utilize the service, they may do so only with the involvement, supervision, and approval of a parent or legal guardian.\n\nIf you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children have provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers. Please contact us at: abuse@HIDIVE.COM or privacy@HIDIVE.COM\n\nDATA SECURITY INTEGRITY AND RETENTION\n\nThe security and confidentiality of user information are extremely important to us. We utilize technical, physical and administrative measures that are intended to protect user information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure. We review periodically our security protocols which review can include updating those protocols to address changes in technology, methods and risks. However, be advised, that despite our best efforts, no protocol is perfect and no security measure can guarantee protection. We retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or otherwise to the extent permissible or required by applicable law.\n\nDATA PROTECTION\n\nWherever your personal information is processed, stored or transferred by us, we will take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of your personal information. We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please immediately notify us at privacy@HIDIVE.COM\n\nSENSITIVE DATA\n\nUnless specifically requested or required by law, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, on or through the Services or otherwise to us, any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, national identification number, data related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, ideological or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background, trade union membership, or administrative or criminal proceedings and sanctions).\n\nCROSS BORDER TRANSFER\n\nHIDIVE provides a global service. Sharing data cross-border is essential to the Services so that you receive the same high-quality service wherever you are in the world. As a result, we will, subject to law, transfer personal information and other data collected in connection with the Services, to entities in countries where data protection standards may differ from those in the country where you reside. By subscribing to our Services, using App’s or using any of the HIDIVE branded services, you understand that we transfer your personal information globally. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries will be entitled to access your personal information.\n\nCOOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LEGAL PROCESS\n\nWe intend to cooperate with valid private party requests, government and law enforcement requests for information made consistent with applicable law. The primary set of laws governing disclosure of user information is found in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701, et seq. (“ECPA”). Because the HIDIVE platform functions as an electronic communications service, ECPA mandates that we disclose certain user information only in response to specific types of government process, including subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants. Generally speaking, ECPA permits disclosure of basic user identity and log-in information in response to a subpoena, but requires a court order to disclose additional user records, or search warrant to authorize disclosure of any online communications (e.g. “chat”). The rules may differ also depending on whether law enforcement seeks information that has already been stored, or to capture information prospectively. We may disclose any information about you to private parties (responsive to valid process), government or law enforcement officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect our rights (or those of a third party), to enforce our terms of use, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, unlawful, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable.\n\nWe may change this Privacy Policy from time to time to address or accommodate technology changes, commercial practices, regulatory requirements and for other purposes.\nWe will provide notice to you to the extent the changes are material. We may also obtain your consent to changes to the extent required by applicable law.\nLINKS TO OTHER SITES\n\nOur sites and applications may provide links or offer re-directs to other sites and applications that are not operated by us and which are not governed by this Privacy Policy. We urge you to review and become familiar with the privacy policies and practices associated with those other sites and applications.\n\nYOUR CONTROLS AND PREFERENCES\n\nWe have enabled features for users to configure how certain information is made available through our social media services. These features are available within the My Account and My Profile sections of the site.\n\nACCOUNT PROFILES\n\nWe enable account holders to create unique profiles to enable a more customized viewing and user experience and to provide our Services in a manner that is relevant to each account holder and profile. If you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they will be able to view your information (including in some cases personal information) such as your watch history, ratings, settings, and account information (including your email address or other account information). Anyone you share or allow to access your account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles. You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not wish them to use or change your profile, it is your responsibility to address such matters with them.\n\nDEACTIVATING YOUR ACCOUNT\n\nIf the Site functionality permits, you can deactivate your account at any time by visiting the preferences page for your profile or delete any content you provide from the Site, though we may retain a copy of any deactivated accounts or deleted content for compliance purposes. When you deactivate your account, your user profiles will be disabled, but your public comments will remain on the site. The Site has no responsibility to take down, remove, or edit any of your public activities or any submissions that are a result of your public activities.

It does not require sites to honor do not track signals and requests, but it does require websites to inform consumers if they disclose consumer data to third parties.\n\n\"Do Not Track\" Notice\n\nBecause providers of \"do not track\" and similar signals do not yet operate according to common, industry-accepted standards, we currently do not respond to those signals.\n\nWeb Site Data Collection\n\nWe do not knowingly allow other parties to collect personal information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites when you use our site and services.\n\nCalifornia Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits registered users who are minors to request and obtain deletion of certain posted content.

need to understand that this is an extremely new iOS app and a new streaming service in general. It’s legit but has a way to go and that’s to be expected. VRV has offered this as part of it’s service as a dub alternative to crunchroll’s sub library ever since Funimation got stingy and backed out within like a year of their deal. With Funimation being such money-grabbers, it’s this or nothing. So the fact that they’re actually keeping their word and bringing a primitive port of the app to both iOS and PS4 is great news to me and I’ve been waiting a while. Expect the library to be small but gradually grow. Expect the app to need work and likely receive it (hopefully.) I’ve kept up with this company and I’ve seen first hand that it has a way to go to compete with Funimation, but I’m grateful someone’s trying.","title":"People need to understand this is new","userName":"acemcfly101"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6955672297","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-05T05:49:29Z","rating":1,"review":"Listen, I could ignore the terrible quality and playback issues that one has to put up with while using your app. I could even deal with the poor functionality of your app in it’s entirety because I am aware that it is very new. However, what I will not accept is signing up for a subscription, having your app crash while I am watching something and then telling me I need to subscribe again. I happened to get the 30 day free trial which my Apple account shows is STILL active, but for whatever asinine reason my account within your systems does not register this anymore. I’m not paying you up front for something that I was given a 30 day free trial for. I would like this fixed because what I am not going to do is pay for an app that does not have the functionality nor the quality to justify the money you ask for. This was the only streaming service I could find that allows me to watch a dubbed season of a specific show so I was willing to deal with the bugs while you guys figured it all out, but not this. There isn’t even a way to contact someone about my issue and your help page is unhelpful, which is why I am taking to this review.

And when it doesn’t the video formatting is terrible. All of the negative reviews are spot on. And their app team doesn’t seem to give a crap about fixing it. I love pretty much all anime and that’s what got me to jump at the subscription, however this is the worst streaming service I’ve tried. I feel like a moron for jumping at the discounted year subscription.  Most titles aren’t available through any app not just iOS. The ones that are won’t play. “Stream not found”. Customer service is a joke. “We’ve tried to recreate the issue but haven’t had any luck.”, is their standard response. I’ve tried the apps on multiple devices from iPads to Xbox to play stations. All have terribly clunky video streaming when it works. Constantly having to delete the apps and reinstall. No way to just restart a video from the beginning. It’s the modern equivalent of having to rewind a vhs. This isn’t some new technology. Video streaming has been up and running for over a decade. The beta for Netflix was 100% better than this. At this point it feels like they are just jerking people around. Definitely not renewing my subscription.","title":"Has more bugs than the notell motel.","userName":"Cody42585"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6955934887","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-02-05T07:30:50Z","rating":4,"review":"I would say this is the best anime app when compared to Funimation or Crunchyroll. There are a lot of common sense features that are offered here that the other two lack. I feel like this company cares about anime whereas the others care more about business. \nThat said, this app isn’t perfect. It regularly “forgets” what episode I’m on in a series which isn’t a big deal for some but is for others. The cast feature also needs to be enabled before starting a video which I count as a minor inconvenience when moving from one room to another.\nThe most disappointing part about this app actually isn’t their fault but how Apple has stunted them by giving them the ultimatum of hiding half of their shows or losing their app altogether on the platform. The fact that Apple is playing favorites with the other anime apps is nothing short of disgrace.\nAll in all, despite the shortcomings, I love this app, I love the value and am happy to continue my support as they grow and improve.","title":"Not without faults, but worth it","userName":"Goonpocalypse"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6747928973","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-12-13T08:01:28Z","rating":2,"review":"Unfortunately, there is a huge difference when it comes to streaming on the website versus streaming on the app.  AppleTV and iPhone apps don’t actually allow all the shows in the library to be seen.  You’re totally missing out on a lot more content and you’re better off watching it from a computer or going to the website as an alternative.  I complained about it a few times and every time the HIDIVE crew actually responds to me they just say something along the lines of not having the full rights for the apps.  Something about it being more expensive on their end.  What kind of crap is that?  Hiding shows that we actually paid for is almost messed up.  If you logon through a browser, the whole library is exposed for you to watch.  I wouldn’t be as upset if you can at least see the whole list whether your using an app or browser and just not allowing playback if they felt like it.  Something about hiding the fact that we have access to more anime that we paid for seems a little shady.","title":"App vs. website","userName":"Doshgoneit"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5166933161","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-11-19T03:36:37Z","rating":1,"review":"Sentai has licensed some great shows, and I have to admit it disappoints me for both the dub quality and because of the execution on this app. I understand there are restrictions and limitations on their ability to deliver on the former, but there is almost no excuse for the latter.\nWhile other apps allow you to jump forward or back in 10 or 15 second increments, that option is missing. Additionally, the progress/scrub bar is situated in such a way that it activates my menu bar.\nI have noticed another issue as well: some multiple-season shows are not accessible under the \"season\" menu and have to be located individually. Oddly enough, the first season shows as \"Season 1\" and the second season shows as \"Season 2\", so I think it might be dirty data causing the seasons to not be grouped together (likely because the titles are slightly different between the seasons).\nLastly, why put a help section with an \"About the App\" tab only to direct the user to go to the site? Why not load the app info within the app?\nThe app feels like a beta that has not fully baked and it causes a lot of frustration as a result.","title":"Amateurish Beta App","userName":"rey-zero"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5353961225","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-01-03T05:35:17Z","rating":1,"review":"So this app “works” but feels very rough around the edges.\n\nI have the iOS subtitle settings at the recommended default and half the time the subs are reversed, with the second line of text displayed before the first line in a sentence.\n\nIt uses its own video scrub/seek bar which is virtually impossible to position at the exact spot you want because it doesn’t tell update and tell you what time you dragged the bar to until you let go. There’s no easy 10/15 second rewind button, which other apps have and is even baked into the default iOS video player.\n\nI had to redownload the app recently to reset everything because a recent update made it stay at the initial loading screen forever.\n\nWhen looking at a show’s episodes, swiping from the left edge of the screen doesn’t go back a view, it always opens the hamburger menu which is frustrating. You have to move your finger all the way up to the back button. \n\nWhat’s even worse is when you’re on the main home screen, the behavior is reversed! Swiping from the left edge when you have shows in your queue doesn’t do anything! You’d expect the hamburger menu to open this time, but it doesn’t! You again have to reach up to the top left to tap the icon to see it.\n\nAll of these small bugs and design issues really add up and make the app a horrible experience to use overall.","title":"Needs way more polish","userName":"ThreeDee912"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6511588005","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-07T22:39:14Z","rating":3,"review":"I really think their anime selection is good but their app is another thing. There’s some problems with it which I don’t mind but it sometimes gets annoying. There’s times the video shows 1/4 of the screen and I have to delete the app and download it again in order for it to work properly. Also I think this app should have more options for when we’re in the video. For example I think the app should have an option to skip the intro, skip 10 seconds (which they have that option but only for the website) and have an option to go to the next video without having to exit the video and go to the next one.
