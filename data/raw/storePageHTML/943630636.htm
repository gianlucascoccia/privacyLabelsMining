      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I went through an experience where I was having to send 30+ people updates by text 2-3 times a day. It was exhausting to copy and paste my message into each individual chat every time. I wished that someone had invented a way to send texts like you send emails - to a group, but not in a group chat. Suddenly I had the idea, “Maybe there’s an app for this.” I typed it in on the App Store and tried and deleted a few terrible duds before I came across this app. Hit Em Up is exactly what I was looking for! Now when I need to send my 30+ contacts an update, I simply go to this app, paste the message ONCE (not 30 times!), and hit “send” to each person. Everyone gets their own individual message, and you can even personalize it with their name. The text sends just like a normal text message, with no “footer” or advertisement for this app attached. Today someone wrote back to me, “How do u send out group texts but it seems as if they are individual texts. Is there a &quot;Bcc&quot; version of text messaging?” I was proud to share them a link to this app! They wrote back, “That’s pretty neat. Brava!” Yep, I’d have to agree!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I purchased a one-month subscription to communicate with a non-profit group&#39;s biennial conference. It worked, but much was lacking for what I wanted it to do--and that is communicate with important updates and changes. 1) I wanted to import &gt;400 names; 2) But I didn&#39;t really want all those names in my private contact list (they are); 3) the restriction that permits sending only 50 texts at a time meant I had to make 9 groups, but the app doesn&#39;t identify what has been sent so it&#39;s counting on fingers; 4) Each of the groups requires multiple click-throughs to actually send a text. Need to be aware of that!; 5) the interface is clunky; and 6) the request to rate the ap is intrusive....again...and again. (I&#39;ll rate it when I know what it can--and cannot--do.)<br />I think there is promise with this app. It worked. It was just difficult to manage and I felt like I was working with 10-year-old software.<br /><br />This app gets higher marks since Zake contacted me so quickly. Unfortunately, although I&#39;d tried out sending texts to a small group--and it did well--the scale up did not perform well for me. I did make separate groups in my contacts by labeling the company field and using that to make my 50-person group text. I still must now delete. More than 400 entries from my personal contact list--unless there is a simpler way?<br />Zake--are you saying that if I used the personalized option, I could have distributed them in one go?</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>EDIT Reply 2: Hi again! Can you please reach out to us directly on our website or me @ Zak@hitemupapp.com? I&#39;d love to walk you through the app and what we&#39;re doing to suit your needs. It takes time for our replies to get approved on the app store so it&#39;s a lot easier to just chat via email or on the phone. As far as the 400 entries, yes you can technically use that and send them sequentially in one go— However! You should note the limitations of sending a lot of messages from your device through SMS and iMessage in quick succession with or without us due to what&#39;s called rate limiting (something carriers do to help cut down on potential spam). I would love to discuss with you personally because you&#39;re the exact type of person we&#39;re building our platform for so if you can email me directly it&#39;s a lot easier to help you out :)<br /><br />Best,<br />Zak Kline<br />Hit Em Up Founder</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app has given me zero problems m. Previously i used an app group text app, which strung together all 72 of my contact list and sent my morning message out all at once. The problem with this although in theory it was simplistic and amazing and no heavy lifting is that the new i0s shortly after iPhone X or right before iPhone X started causing problems with group text, and not everyone in the list of 72 received the messages. You have no way of knowing until someone ask you why they have not received it. <br /><br />With this app, i have to individually press send on each contact which is annoying and if i ever surpassed 100 i will need a more efficient solution or hope that iOS has their crap together so i can go back to sending just one string of all contacts. But the other positive with individually sending the text is that i know everyone received and if For some reason there is an error you will be able to see on that persons text thread that they didn’t receive it. I have had 0 percent Failures since using this app.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hey, macnealean!<br /><br />Thank you a lot for your comment! Our team is really sorry that you&#39;ve experienced some trouble with the app you&#39;ve used previously, and we&#39;re sorry that you have to deal with the inconvenience of having to individually press &quot;send&quot; for each contact now. Sadly, we can&#39;t eliminate Apple&#39;s algorithm. Apple keeps tight security over spammers, and while you send out each message individually through your messaging app of choice, it detects you as a spammer, because you send out more than one message per second. That can result in you being caught in a spam filter or even getting your texting function enabled for up to 48 hours. WE really hope that you understand!<br /><br />It would be really great to receive any other comments, wishes, or questions about the app on feedback@hitemupapp.com, or you can always contact us directly on hitemupapp.com/contact. It would really help us to grow!<br /><br />Iya @ Hit Em Up ❤️Customer Success Team. 👩‍💻</p>

What that means for you is that some of the contacts you have selected to be in your groups that you have made may now be hidden at the bottom of the group list as indicated by the red closed eye icon where the green checkmark used to be. This is intentional!! We did not remove your contacts which we have now hidden from your groups because we want to give you the choice: simply tap them once in the group to unhide them and be able to send to them OR, even better, search for the 'better' (more complete contact) that we have identified  in the \"Add People\" Plus (+) at the top of the group. We didn't remove or replace people because some people have selected a specific number or name on an existing contact that we did not want to override with our software. Instead, we give you, the user, the choice. You may also, if you have time, consider using this opportunity to clean up your contacts and merge them in your Apple contacts by having one contact record per phone number and consolidating the information onto one contact with the mobile phone number indicated as either \"mobile\" or \"iPhone,\" as our app will pick these numbers by default to send texts to and fallback to any others you may have if it can't find those. We do a lot of cleaning up for you so you don't have to do this, but it's considered a best practice and will improve your experience using your phone in general and will allow you to fully leverage our app now and in the future.

It was exhausting to copy and paste my message into each individual chat every time. I wished that someone had invented a way to send texts like you send emails - to a group, but not in a group chat. Suddenly I had the idea, “Maybe there’s an app for this.” I typed it in on the App Store and tried and deleted a few terrible duds before I came across this app. Hit Em Up is exactly what I was looking for! Now when I need to send my 30+ contacts an update, I simply go to this app, paste the message ONCE (not 30 times!), and hit “send” to each person. Everyone gets their own individual message, and you can even personalize it with their name. The text sends just like a normal text message, with no “footer” or advertisement for this app attached. Today someone wrote back to me, “How do u send out group texts but it seems as if they are individual texts.

As far as the 400 entries, yes you can technically use that and send them sequentially in one go— However! You should note the limitations of sending a lot of messages from your device through SMS and iMessage in quick succession with or without us due to what's called rate limiting (something carriers do to help cut down on potential spam).

It worked, but much was lacking for what I wanted it to do--and that is communicate with important updates and changes. 1) I wanted to import \u003e400 names; 2) But I didn't really want all those names in my private contact list (they are); 3) the restriction that permits sending only 50 texts at a time meant I had to make 9 groups, but the app doesn't identify what has been sent so it's counting on fingers; 4) Each of the groups requires multiple click-throughs to actually send a text. Need to be aware of that!; 5) the interface is clunky; and 6) the request to rate the ap is intrusive....again...and again. (I'll rate it when I know what it can--and cannot--do.)\nI think there is promise with this app. It worked. It was just difficult to manage and I felt like I was working with 10-year-old software.\n\nThis app gets higher marks since Zake contacted me so quickly.

Our team is really sorry that you've experienced some trouble with the app you've used previously, and we're sorry that you have to deal with the inconvenience of having to individually press \"send\" for each contact now. Sadly, we can't eliminate Apple's algorithm. Apple keeps tight security over spammers, and while you send out each message individually through your messaging app of choice, it detects you as a spammer, because you send out more than one message per second. That can result in you being caught in a spam filter or even getting your texting function enabled for up to 48 hours.

I use this for my employees, a group of 21 people. You can create groups and different subsets if you don’t need to include everyone. I also really like that it has a birthday function which notifies you of birthdays in your contacts list if you include that information when creating your contact. The reason this isn’t necessarily the best choice for a large group is because you have to actually hit send for each contact. It constructs the message based on the template you give it so all you have to hit is send, but if you were using this for say-a few hundred people- that may get annoying. However, it’s a great choice if you don’t want to send 30 or 40 messages individually but are okay hitting send a few times. It saves you a lot of time.

It's pleasing to the eye and so easy to work. I 100% recommend this app, it's totally worth paying $15 to use for a year. I got the rest of my co workers using it and they love it as well!","title":"So Convenient","userName":"Jessi Prie"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2538166473","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-05-12T18:26:30Z","developerResponse":{"id":3654510,"body":"Hey there!

I’m using it for a small nonprofit that needs to quickly communicate with big groups of volunteers. I had no problem for the first year I used it but lately I’m not able to send ANYTHING.\nOr maybe something has changed and now there is no record of the texts that have been sent? I have tried sending to just one contact, no luck. And I’ve tried to contact support but haven’t heard back (note, this could be my bad though because I’m not entirely sure the message went through). Point is, this is a well designed app and if you can get it to work for you, it’s really helpful and time saving. But heads up to the developers, this user is having trouble sending things out and no longer has anything come up when she clicks to contact support.","title":"So great!

What that means for you is that some of the contacts you have selected to be in your groups that you have made may now be hidden at the bottom of the group list as indicated by the red closed eye icon where the green checkmark used to be. This is intentional!! We did not remove your contacts which we have now hidden from your groups because we want to give you the choice: simply tap them once in the group to unhide them and be able to send to them OR, even better, search for the 'better' (more complete contact) that we have identified  in the \"Add People\" Plus (+) at the top of the group. We didn't remove or replace people because some people have selected a specific number or name on an existing contact that we did not want to override with our software. Instead, we give you, the user, the choice. You may also, if you have time, consider using this opportunity to clean up your contacts and merge them in your Apple contacts by having one contact record per phone number and consolidating the information onto one contact with the mobile phone number indicated as either \"mobile\" or \"iPhone,\" as our app will pick these numbers by default to send texts to and fallback to any others you may have if it can't find those. We do a lot of cleaning up for you so you don't have to do this, but it's considered a best practice and will improve your experience using your phone in general and will allow you to fully leverage our app now and in the future.
