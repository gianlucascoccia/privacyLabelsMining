      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>With the limitations of both the native Hue app, Apple HomeKit, and all of the other comprehensive controllers, this has by far the most features, the best interface, and makes the most out of your Hue and Friends of Hue devices. It also leverages newer iOS tools like Siri, Shortcuts, and Widgets nicely. Finally, it’s very well supported. The price is cheap for various functions that I found myself buying some of the silly prebuilt color scenes just because I wanted to give the creator the support to keep making a great product. Also, multiple hubs is supported better than Hue does it, though it requires multiple Hue accounts. (Not ICH’s fault.)<br /><br />Sure, there is plenty more stuff that if could have like a way to create a mode to operate where controls were less “volatile” so guests don’t accidentally change your settings. Also, a comprehensive backup and restore functional would be terrific. Since this app can not control what other apps out in your Hue hub. Sometimes they can mess things up so it would be nice to wipe the hub and restore it from a point in time rather than try to manually “clean it”. Based in past experience, of other uses want this too, the developer will probably get on this because the app is constantly improving.<br /><br />Worth every in-app purchase!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I am up to 28 hue lights at my house since getting my first two in 2015. This is by far the best app for managing and using them. Even though Philips improved their free app a couple of years ago, it’s still not nearly as easy to use as iConnectHue. I know because my mom only has five hue lights and she still uses the Philips app, so I do too when I stay at her house. This is a great developer who is constantly improving his app, updating it, making sure it stays bug free as the iOS versions roll out, and coming up with creative new fun things to do with it. The intuitive visual user interface is a genuine pleasure to use both to control lights and to make scenes and Siri Shortcuts. It’s very well worth the money, and the add-ons like the watch app. FYI, the watch app ran too slowly for me to be very useful until I got a series 5. If you would spend as much as $50 for one friggin lightbulb, why not spend five dollars to be able to make the easiest and best use of it? You do get what you pay for, and the Philips app is free. Get what I’m saying?</p>

</h3>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is easily the best app for controlling your Philips Hue lights! FAR better, even, than the app from Philips Hue! The ability to create scenes, animations, etc., makes it one or two touches to have your lights do exactly what you want them to do! The apartment I built doesn’t have windows, so I was looking to build a lighting system that could follow the sun in both brightness and color temperature in the built-in “windows” I created to emulate sunrise and sunset and all the stages of lighting throughout the day. The systems I was looking at were going to cost $2,000-$5,000! Then I found Philips Hue and this app. It allows me to do all of that and so much more. I now have my entire house automated with the Hue lights and accessories through this app. The addition of motion detectors and programming to control exactly what I want to happen is incredible. And when I want them to change to something different, one touch of the button is all it takes. Create zones, rooms......whatever you want and have it do whatever you want! Just a great app!!</p>

It also leverages newer iOS tools like Siri, Shortcuts, and Widgets nicely. Finally, it’s very well supported. The price is cheap for various functions that I found myself buying some of the silly prebuilt color scenes just because I wanted to give the creator the support to keep making a great product. Also, multiple hubs is supported better than Hue does it, though it requires multiple Hue accounts. (Not ICH’s fault.)\n\nSure, there is plenty more stuff that if could have like a way to create a mode to operate where controls were less “volatile” so guests don’t accidentally change your settings. Also, a comprehensive backup and restore functional would be terrific. Since this app can not control what other apps out in your Hue hub. Sometimes they can mess things up so it would be nice to wipe the hub and restore it from a point in time rather than try to manually “clean it”.

I know because my mom only has five hue lights and she still uses the Philips app, so I do too when I stay at her house. This is a great developer who is constantly improving his app, updating it, making sure it stays bug free as the iOS versions roll out, and coming up with creative new fun things to do with it. The intuitive visual user interface is a genuine pleasure to use both to control lights and to make scenes and Siri Shortcuts. It’s very well worth the money, and the add-ons like the watch app. FYI, the watch app ran too slowly for me to be very useful until I got a series 5.

FAR better, even, than the app from Philips Hue! The ability to create scenes, animations, etc., makes it one or two touches to have your lights do exactly what you want them to do!

The systems I was looking at were going to cost $2,000-$5,000! Then I found Philips Hue and this app. It allows me to do all of that and so much more. I now have my entire house automated with the Hue lights and accessories through this app. The addition of motion detectors and programming to control exactly what I want to happen is incredible.

You’ll have to spend a good long while just farting around with what each section does, then more time trying to figure out how to apply it to one or more areas, then more time if you want to learn how to do any “animations”. Then more money of course if you want to use any of those. Oh, then more time trying to figure out how to organize your “custom” “animations”.

Simply go to the lights, and press the wizard button on the top left to start the process.\nIf you migrate from an old light with limited colors, iConnectHue will recalculate your scenes so the new lights have the same colors!\n\nScene cleanup\n\nAre you at your bridge scenes limit?\nIn your bridge settings you can now clean up scenes to make space of this precious resource. Tick the type of scenes youâ€™d like to clean up and let it run. The resources page now also lists available scenes.\n\nWidget entry renaming\n\nYou can now name your widget items the way you want. Long press a name in the table below your items and name it. Deleting the name returns to the automatically generated name.\nMake your spacers a headline to sort your widget - they can be named as well and become a headline once named.\nIf you have Pro and hence the Widget available on your watch, the names will be there as well.\n\nMultiple daylight timers per group\n\nIf you want to split sunrise and sunset actions for week and weekends, or want to switch between multiple settings by enabling/disabling them, you can now do so. Each group now allows for multiple daylight timers.\n(requires an up to date bridge firmware)\n\nRandom scene shake\n\nShake in your scene, Magic Scene or animation view to activate a random scene!\nAlso: Once you've activated a Magic Scene, tap on the icon to randomize it.\n\nSeveral other improvements\nWe've made several other improvements as well. Here they are:\n\n• More accurate drag \u0026 drop colors between old and new lights\n• The Celsius/Fahrenheit setting in iOS is now used (You can change it under iOS' Settings-\u003eGeneral-\u003eLanguage and Region)\n• Added support for new Immax and Innr lights\n• More Hue lights recognized (Your icon is still missing? Write us and name the light!)\n• Disabling things now means to swipe right - on devices and timers you now need to swipe right to reveal \"disable\", fully swipe right to quickly en/disable things\n• Timers usually take less resources\n• Solved an issue with fading randomized timers (please delete these and set them up again)\n\nAs always we have improved the app in several details. But why explain something that you'll likely never stumble upon again from now on? We hope you enjoy this new release of iConnectHue! If you find anything suspicious, let us know!\n\n\n•• Please give us a good App Store rating, if you like these changes or want to support iConnectHue.
