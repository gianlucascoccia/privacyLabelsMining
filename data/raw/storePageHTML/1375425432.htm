      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is one of the best games of this genre, all the others I have stopped playing but this is lasting so far. I downloaded after the annoying persistent advertisement. Keeps me busy, it’s much easier to do daily and weekly quests and all that. There’s so much to do. I’d say I’m progressing very well for not paying any money, just making sure I check in. Everything is great.<br /><br />EXCEPT, the arcane labyrinth has become darn near impossible. I understand it’s supposed to scale up with your progress, but there’s been twice now that I can’t get past level two of the labyrinth no how many Dura’s Tears I use. The reason I’m writing this review is because I almost finished the level two boss five minutes ago, but there’s one hero I cannot beat. After using Dura’s Tears twice, my teams of five cannot get this lvl 160 Antandra to half health before she singlehandedly destroys alllll of my hero’s, twice. I can’t imagine floor three at this point. My highest hero’s are level 120 and I feel the only way to break this limit is to pay money. All my Resonating Crystal hero’s are like level 111. This is the kinda thing that makes the game monotonous. I cannot for the life of me beat this one hero with everything that I’ve worked towards, and I don’t wanna pay any money.<br /><br />Other than that the game is fantastic</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Dear Adventurer, the choice of relics and opponents is important, and the superposition additive effects of relics will greatly improve combat effectiveness. Furthermore, the interplay of the heroes will create a superposition effect.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Usually I don’t play much mobile games, but this one caught my attention.  I have played afk games before but this one is different in the sense that the feeling of waiting.. is rewarding.  I know sounds funny but I actually enjoy the games mechanics.  The longer you wait the more resources you collect to equip your heroes and level them up.  You can choose to spend real money to buy gems which can be used to get better heroes and gear which sounds like a bad thing, expect it’s not.  The deals they offer is actually not that bad with specials popping up so every often and new deals coming out daily.  The other thing I like about this game is that if you truly just want to grind your way to success, you can you just have to be determined to do so.  Another cool concept which is new to me is the ability to pay for one of two subscriptions. The normal monthly which rewards you with a pretty sum of gems for the price tag of $5 a month (not that bad considering the amount you will receive overall) and the premium subscription which is $15 (insanely high amount of gems rewarded, around 120,000 which is about $100 dollars worth upfront if you think about it) overall, I’m a fan of the game and I’ll continue on playing.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have played many of these types of games before. I like the premise that gatcha games have, and know what these games need to have in order to be enjoyable. This game has the usual aspects with the summoning type system and level layout. The characters/artwork are beautiful as well making it one of the most eye catching game I have played in a while. In my opinion, though, the best aspect is the AFK part of this game. Most like it don’t have this system and requires you to pay money and constantly play in order to progress at a good rate. This game allows you to not only spend less money but also progress at the same rate even without being active. I wish that more games could have this type of system. This was what I enjoyed from the game so far.<br /><br />In another review of this game, someone had a problem where their game would crash constantly. In response to this, a developer instructed to free up space on their phone by at least 2 GB. I have 5 GB of free space, but I cannot even access the loading screen without the game crashing. Just in case internet access is a factor, I have very fast and good connection. This problem is so bad that every time I delete and reinstall the app, I can only get to the game twice before it refuses to open again. I have done this 5 times already. I like what I have seen so far of the game and want to progress, but this flaw is preventing me.</p>

I downloaded after the annoying persistent advertisement. Keeps me busy, it’s much easier to do daily and weekly quests and all that. There’s so much to do. I’d say I’m progressing very well for not paying any money, just making sure I check in. Everything is great.\n\nEXCEPT, the arcane labyrinth has become darn near impossible. I understand it’s supposed to scale up with your progress, but there’s been twice now that I can’t get past level two of the labyrinth no how many Dura’s Tears I use. The reason I’m writing this review is because I almost finished the level two boss five minutes ago, but there’s one hero I cannot beat. After using Dura’s Tears twice, my teams of five cannot get this lvl 160 Antandra to half health before she singlehandedly destroys alllll of my hero’s, twice. I can’t imagine floor three at this point. My highest hero’s are level 120 and I feel the only way to break this limit is to pay money. All my Resonating Crystal hero’s are like level 111. This is the kinda thing that makes the game monotonous. I cannot for the life of me beat this one hero with everything that I’ve worked towards, and I don’t wanna pay any money.\n\nOther than that the game is fantastic","title":"One frustrating problem.","userName":"NotFootballSavvy"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5515285160","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-02-11T04:23:47Z","rating":5,"review":"Usually I don’t play much mobile games, but this one caught my attention.  I have played afk games before but this one is different in the sense that the feeling of waiting.. is rewarding.  I know sounds funny but I actually enjoy the games mechanics.  The longer you wait the more resources you collect to equip your heroes and level them up.  You can choose to spend real money to buy gems which can be used to get better heroes and gear which sounds like a bad thing, expect it’s not.  The deals they offer is actually not that bad with specials popping up so every often and new deals coming out daily.  The other thing I like about this game is that if you truly just want to grind your way to success, you can you just have to be determined to do so.  Another cool concept which is new to me is the ability to pay for one of two subscriptions. The normal monthly which rewards you with a pretty sum of gems for the price tag of $5 a month (not that bad considering the amount you will receive overall) and the premium subscription which is $15 (insanely high amount of gems rewarded, around 120,000 which is about $100 dollars worth upfront if you think about it) overall, I’m a fan of the game and I’ll continue on playing.","title":"Just started and liking it so far","userName":"VikaVeeks"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5322600201","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-12-26T16:57:58Z","developerResponse":{"id":12609390,"body":"Greetings Adventurer, we appreciate for your gorgeous feedback and we always strive to attach the players' experience to the priority.

I like the premise that gatcha games have, and know what these games need to have in order to be enjoyable. This game has the usual aspects with the summoning type system and level layout. The characters/artwork are beautiful as well making it one of the most eye catching game I have played in a while. In my opinion, though, the best aspect is the AFK part of this game. Most like it don’t have this system and requires you to pay money and constantly play in order to progress at a good rate. This game allows you to not only spend less money but also progress at the same rate even without being active. I wish that more games could have this type of system. This was what I enjoyed from the game so far.\n\nIn another review of this game, someone had a problem where their game would crash constantly. In response to this, a developer instructed to free up space on their phone by at least 2 GB. I have 5 GB of free space, but I cannot even access the loading screen without the game crashing. Just in case internet access is a factor, I have very fast and good connection. This problem is so bad that every time I delete and reinstall the app, I can only get to the game twice before it refuses to open again. I have done this 5 times already.

It is one of those few games whose mechanics are simple to learn yet feels challenging as you progress. I love the amount of characters that are available in the game, and the progression mechanics are great. My biggest flaw with this game is the loading screen. What I mean by loading screen, is not the initial app start up screen that pops up, rather the loading icon with the galloping horses pulling a carriage. This icon pops up when the game is trying to load or render something such as an action (input by user). I am playing this game on an IPhone 8 Plus 256GB model and with the latest version of Mac iOS, but this game runs absolutely horrendous on this software (not the hardware on the phone itself or my internet connection). It seems like anytime I click a “Begin” button, try to collect loot, open or click anything, I will almost (about 90% of the time) always get this annoying loading screen which can last 5-20 seconds or more. I have this same game on an older 2016 Samsung galaxy tablet with only 2 GB of RAM and this game plays as smooth as possible on that device.

The developers and artist did an amazing job on this game making it easy to navigate, not cluttered, no ads! And minimal BUY HERE options.

It can be fun because it requires less active commitment to play and or grind for exp, weapons, and money. Sadly if you don’t spend real money into the game you have no chance of success. The sheer amount of duplicates needed to Ascend/upgrade your units is staggering. There is a reward system per pull to get a random epic but that is few and far between and isn’t enough to make continual progress as the only things that matter are 4skill epic pulls and they are extremely rare. The tower and campaign are similar but the arcane labyrinth is a demented joke since after you get past the first few days you will probably never beat level 3 without using revival potions and even then the matches are setup to be double or triple power vs any of your troops. And the labyrinth scales against you so if you get stronger your enemies double which is kind of crappy since the game sets quest rewards for completing an event that can’t be defeated by non paying customers. This is a F2P P2W game so it boils down to you will either take it for its content and enjoy it or you won’t . It does have some interesting game mechanics that make it a good time waster without needing a story to drag you through the game.

(One of them is more serious and important than the other. The second one is probably the least important and isn’t the reason why my review is only 4 stars.) Anyways the first issue is the scammers, there are scammers everywhere, thankfully there’s a report message button but it still feels like there should be more ways to prevent/report scammers(AND other things too, like bullies, but so far I haven’t met any bullies right now that are bullying me so... hooray for me so far!) like, I want at least a couple more options than just report the message or blocking them. The second least important one is in the block menu, if you hadn’t blocked anyone it says: “you have no friends right now” or something like that. Which, when you think about it that should probably say something else. Other than those issues, I love this game, how it battles monsters to earn gold and other stuff like that.

I thought adding this feature would be a really nice idea. But then I realized this system needed some work. The fact that you can only use your friends hero for only 1 battle per week is kind of outrageous. Also, once you return your friend’s hero back it doesn’t let anyone else rent it for the entire rest of the week and I think that’s a bit stupid.\n\nI think we should be able to rent the hero and actually be able to use them to help us on our quests, and not just for once battle a week. It takes a long time to get through the campaign, and can even take a week or more to get through a stage.

Its a healthy community, where bad things are taken down very quickly. However, there are still trolls. Its not fair of me to ask them to fix that, because trolls are always there. But just a warning. I’ve had to take delete some  innocent comments because of the really harsh and rude responses from others. It scared me and really hurt my feelings. The actual chat though, is a whole different story. If I went online right now, there would be people swearing for really no reason at all, spamming, or randomly threatening death, sexual assault, etc. And that makes me scared to just play the game. Also, Lilith keeps developing dimensional heroes and a really fast pace, which makes it kinda hard for f2p players. (f2p=free 2 play, doesn't spend money on the game).

Sure this is like most games but when you spent your diamonds and the rate it's a 50% rate to get a common unit which is completely useless and only a 4% chance to get the useful unit. And to get more diamonds after you waste them is to either wait and grind or pay just for the same shorty pulls. And if you want to actually compete with the top players in the server you will never beat them unless you pay as much as them giving no chcefor ftp player a chance. I'm just about ready to delete the app, and I'm leaving this 1 star review while I'm still currently playing. I play the game everyday and joined really early in when a server opened. I'm close to the top 50 for both staging and the tower but the difference between the top players is so massive. The top player is almost 3 whole chapters above the 2nd highest player. The main issue is that it gets hard to save up diamonds and to waste them by getting 7 green and 3 blue is not going to help people progress or catch up to those that p2w. Increasing the rates slightly or heavily lower the rate of green on diamond summons would help. And more events(like the Easter one but less pay for eggs) that can allow people to work for a goal and pick something that will help them.","title":"P2w with bad summon rates","userName":"Greedy
