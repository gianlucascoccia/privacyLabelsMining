      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app rocks, perfect complement and learning guide to many of the major non-fiction self improvement books and more of course :).  When I first downloaded the app 10 of the initial 20 books were ones that I’ve already read/listened to on Audiobook.  StoryShots consolidates all the main lessons from the books and let’s you learn based on your preferred style (auditory, visual or written) and it’s free!!!!!!</p>

A huge selection of great titles, they add more all the time. One small qualm is I wish I had the option to hide titles I have no interest in (certain political titles). Keep up the great work!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have enjoyed quite a few book summaries on the app, and the overall selection of titles is impressive. However, some of the “main shot” summaries feel like some random person’s biased opinion of the content instead of an actual book synopsis. I hope the administrators will work on keeping the content true to the books being reviewed and less of the opinionated rants I’ve come across.</p>

But have you ever left one unfinished? Instead, use StoryShots to learn or review the key takeaways of bestselling nonfiction books in minutes; instead of hours or never. Remember, you can't make more time. But you can make the most of it.\n\nFREE STREAMING\n\nEnjoy the key takeaways of 400+ bestsellers online for free. No other app makes such an offer.\n\nMULTIMEDIA - LEARN THE WAY YOU LIKE\n\nSome people like to read. Some like to listen. Others like to watch an animation. You can do all three with StoryShots for every book!\n\nPDF \u0026 SEND TO KINDLE SUPPORT\n\nDo you prefer to read on the desktop, Kindle or your Kobo device? We've got you covered.\n\nOUR MISSION\n\nWe want to make the core lessons of the world's best books accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget, time, and learning preference.\n\nTRY BOOKS BEFORE BUYING THEM TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY\n\nThe key takeaways of each book are on average 15 minutes long. If you read just two books a day using StoryShots, every year, you can save more than $10,000 not buying books that will end up gathering dust on your bookshelf and 9 weeks not reading books that will disappoint you. Invest that time and money in books or other means of education that excite and benefit you.\n\nMULTIPLE CATEGORIES\n\nThe books fall into these categories: business, entrepreneurship, management, leadership, self-improvement, personal development, productivity, time management, psychology, habits, health, fitness, nutrition, money, investing, economics, marketing, sales, history, philosophy, science, mindfulness, happiness, communication skills, dating, and relationships. \n\nMULTIPLE LANGUAGES\n\nWe have content in 18 different languages including Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi, French, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Italian, Persian, German, and Turkish.\n\nStoryShots™ is for you if you:\n\n * get frustrated when an author repeats the same concept over and over\n * want to challenge yourself to read more\n * are a visual learner and prefer to watch a video or animation\n * feel guilty about not reading a recommended book\n * can't get through your growing stack of must-read books\n * want to be more efficient and productive by learning on the go\n * need to learn the big ideas of a book before attending an event or walking into a meeting\n * want to review the key takeaways of a bestseller you've read before\n\nThe key ideas are carefully handpicked from thousands of Youtube channels, TED talks, podcasts, and blogs. Think of them as condensed ebooks, audiobooks, and cartoon adaptations of bestsellers. Learn the wisdom the authors have gained over 10000 hours of hard work in just 15 minutes.\n\nYOU CAN'T MAKE MORE TIME BUT YOU CAN MAKE THE MOST OF IT\n\nDownload the app now and discover your next life-changing book.\n\nSTORYSHOTS SUBSCRIPTION TERMS\n\nStoryShots offers a free version with a monthly and annual premium subscription for offline downloads. not displaying ads, highlighting, note-taking, and more.
