      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Accessibility to fitness is difficult for lots of people because of how expensive classes and gyms can be.  Hoorah for making an app with a huge fitness library that’s freeee.  This is the best fitness app I’ve ever used as far as motivation and variety goes.  I’ve consistently worked out every day since downloading it and have added a lot of variation to my workouts.  I downloaded pro since they were having a promo.  I don’t use the meal plans but do use the meals section to add recipes to my grocery list when I’m in a rut.   <br /><br />I have a bit of feedback but I’m confident small things will continue to improve as the app develops. 1).  I wish there was a search feature. Sometimes I want to type a key word in and see everything that qualifies, or want to type an ingredient in and see which recipes use it. 2). A couple of recipes are missing parts to them like the salted caramel pancakes don’t actually include the recipe or ingredients for the salted caramel (I found that part online though so, no big deal.) 3). I can’t play the meditations with my phone screen off.  This is mostly an issue with the sleep mediations.  Deandre’s sleep meditations are some of the best I’ve ever used but if I fall asleep during the meditation,  I wake up hours later to a hot phone after the screen has been on all night :-( <br /><br />None of that will make me stop using the app, I can see myself using this app for a very long time.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I honestly never review apps. This might be my first ever. But it’s worth it because this app has been HUGE for me starting my new fitness journey this year. I’ve been wanting to get in better shape and move my body more, but because of schedules and life and everything it’s hard for me to actually get myself to a gym. I’ve done at-home workouts before, mostly yoga, but was never able to stay consistent. A friend recommended this app and since it’s all FREE (did I mention that every workout forever is FREE?!?) I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did because I have been HOOKED ever since. I love the 3-5 minute daily workouts for morning, afternoon, and night. I have timed notifications set up and since it’s only a few minutes it’s so easy for me to at least complete my at-work and pre-bedtime workouts every day. The at-work stretches in particular have been absolutely amazing, it’s a great way to get me up and away from my computer for just a few minutes to keep my body moving throughout the day. Each week you get personalized recommended workouts, but you can always search and explore for others that fit your mood, time limit, intensity level, etc. There are fun challenges and celebrity workouts and all kinds of things that keep this app fresh. I couldn’t recommend it more. Definitely give it a try!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>i used to workout all the time, played 3 sports in high school.. and maintained a healthy 110lbs til i was 27. then before ya know it, i’m 31 years old and 150lbs barely fitting into clothes and super discouraged about myself. i like to work out but have had ZERO motivation over the years. downloaded this app (one of about 20 over the last 4 years) and as i was making my way around the app, i instantly knew this was the one. SUPER user friendly, extremely customizable, and while you’re looking at it, it’s SO hard to make up ANY excuse for why you can’t follow this video for what, 15 mins?! i did my first one today and as soon as i was done, found another one to do! later on i’m looking around the app to see what i will do for tomorrow and i see these “live classes” no one else can see you, they’re just going on at a certain time, well the next one was about to start in 4 mins and it was a 15 min class. i literally said to myself, why the hell not? i will spend the next 15 mins on some type of internet anyways.. joined my first class and it was perfect. again- almost impossible to make up any excuse not to do it. just got up out of bed, turned on the video and went to town, didn’t have any weights or anything- wasn’t even needed (especially for a “beginner”). SUPER LONG STORY-JUST DO IT. you’ll thank us all later.</p>

to fitness is difficult for lots of people because of how expensive classes and gyms can be.  Hoorah for making an app with a huge fitness library that’s freeee.  This is the best fitness app I’ve ever used as far as motivation and variety goes.  I’ve consistently worked out every day since downloading it and have added a lot of variation to my workouts.  I downloaded pro since they were having a promo.  I don’t use the meal plans but do use the meals section to add recipes to my grocery list when I’m in a rut.   \n\nI have a bit of feedback but I’m confident small things will continue to improve as the app develops. 1).  I wish there was a search feature. Sometimes I want to type a key word in and see everything that qualifies, or want to type an ingredient in and see which recipes use it. 2). A couple of recipes are missing parts to them like the salted caramel pancakes don’t actually include the recipe or ingredients for the salted caramel (I found that part online though so, no big deal.) 3). I can’t play the meditations with my phone screen off.  This is mostly an issue with the sleep mediations.  Deandre’s sleep meditations are some of the best I’ve ever used but if I fall asleep during the meditation,  I wake up hours later to a hot phone after the screen has been on all night :-( \n\nNone of that will make me stop using the app, I can see myself using this app for a very long time.","title":"Best Fitness App, have a bit of feedback","userName":"TJR1987"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5421716106","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-01-19T05:00:27Z","rating":5,"review":"I honestly never review apps. This might be my first ever. But it’s worth it because this app has been HUGE for me starting my new fitness journey this year. I’ve been wanting to get in better shape and move my body more, but because of schedules and life and everything it’s hard for me to actually get myself to a gym. I’ve done at-home workouts before, mostly yoga, but was never able to stay consistent. A friend recommended this app and since it’s all FREE (did I mention that every workout forever is FREE?!?) I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did because I have been HOOKED ever since. I love the 3-5 minute daily workouts for morning, afternoon, and night. I have timed notifications set up and since it’s only a few minutes it’s so easy for me to at least complete my at-work and pre-bedtime workouts every day. The at-work stretches in particular have been absolutely amazing, it’s a great way to get me up and away from my computer for just a few minutes to keep my body moving throughout the day. Each week you get personalized recommended workouts, but you can always search and explore for others that fit your mood, time limit, intensity level, etc. There are fun challenges and celebrity workouts and all kinds of things that keep this app fresh.

FitOn is what I always wished I could find in a fitness app: the freedom to get in shape at home on my time frame. With 5 children my life is crazy busy and my health has taken a hit. I have tried the gym (you need a sitter and drive time plus the membership fees), jogging outside daily (I developed a hip that continues to pop out of socket), exercise videos (snore, bored after 4-5 run through of the same thing), other apps out there are either expensive or only provide short video clips of moves. I LOVE how I feel like I am in an actual one-on-one training session with an honest to goodness knowledgeable trainer! I love being able to pick workout videos from a variety of intensities and genres (goodbye boredom). The app provides a daily motivational quote. You can take pictures of yourself to document your journey and share them (or not). You receive badges for completing a certain number of workouts. You can also join challenges that tell you which workouts to complete during the week. I find the whole app to be completely motivating and delightful. I look forward to working out and have already noticed a change in my fitness, stamina and appearance after only a month.

The trainers are articulate, helpful, and instructional. They remind you of form and motivate you the entire way through. The workouts are ranked by intensity as well as organized by category. The only issue I’ve had so far is mainly because of my preference for trainers. I like trainers that don’t rush you through the exercises, especially if the screenshot is limited and I can’t get a good feel for the form (and especially for the lowest level workouts since I’m attempting to get into the workout habit). Other than that, I commend the developers for putting out high quality workouts that are inspiring, motivational, and actually do challenge you to become stronger, healthier, and more confident. Thank you for your efforts to bring us this app. I appreciate it.","title":"Incredibly help app that’s free","userName":"jlcabell"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5781299081","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-08T14:56:43Z","rating":5,"review":"Who hasn’t search for a workout app that you absolutely love. And I already have a few on my phone. But an ad came up On one of the games I was playing , And what got me interested was that it said it was completely free. Usually there’s a catch for bed so usually I’ll check it out anyway. So I downloaded the app and every single workout is free. 100%, no lying, The only cost for the app is to get the customized meal plan. And even that is so cheap as well. Way cheaper than what you would spend to get on other plans for any other app or weight loss plan. I absolutely love this app and I love how the workouts are all different. You can decide the time limit, you can decide who you want to work out with, you can share when you do work out, it’s tracks your workout, you can have favorite, search a trainer, schedule reminders, rate each workout, it’s so much for $0. I’ve been telling everyone about it, it’s the best workout app I’ve found. \nMy only issue is that when I click on my reminder, I do the workout, then I can’t click out of the workout when it’s done. I have to close the app altogether. But then again, in coming to leave a review, I noticed it needed an update. So it’s probably because I hadn’t updated it.

I love all the instructors, they are there with you so while my muscles are burning they’re doing it with me, acknowledging the burn and encouraging through the entire workout. It’s like built in accountability! They help me smile through the burn. I have worked out every single day since downloading the app because I love the variety and they have great options for time, if you only have a few minutes they got you covered! And I feel they really maximize efficiency during those few minutes so if you’re following along and putting in the work, those few minutes go a long way for the rest of the day. I love how you can choose different styles of workouts and different levels of difficulty. Seriously cannot recommend this app enough, and the workouts are all completely FREE!!

I have some reservations about the “calorie burn tracking” feature with the videos, which seems especially arbitrary for people like me who don’t have a Fitbit or apple watch tracking our heart rate. My only suggestion would be to make that feature optional, so that people could choose whether or not to participate in it.

Then i found out it doesn’t default to “cc on” after you’ve turned it on once like i assume it would. Instead at the beginning on every workout video i have to go and turn cc on. Every single time. I can see that getting real old real fast. Devs please just let it change the default so that after you’ve turned cc on once it’s default to always have them on. \nSecond the closed captions r not useable. U have them super tiny down at very bottom edge of screen. Which would make them hard to read as is. But then on top of that theres that lil like 3 in long bar thing that stays at bottom on videos on iOS devices which then also blocks part of the view of the closed captions making them completely unusable so i have no idea what the trainers r saying. Please make the closed captions larger and move them up a bit from the very bottom edge of the screen so they’re not blocked. \nThird this isn’t related to Deaf accessibility but the app frequently nags about upgrading to fitonpro.

One suggestion I have is that I would like the option to view the individual exercises and reps in a written format underneath the equipment and exercise description. Since I am a visual person and I have trouble with certain exercises due to a knee injury, it would be nice to preview what the video consists of before watching it.
