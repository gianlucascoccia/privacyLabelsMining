Will you launch epic wars and conquer the entire world? Or rise up as a virtuous leader renowned for your sagacity? Will you set off to explore the unknown as a pioneer? Or dedicate yourself to helping your own people?\n \nOnly time will tell...\n \n***Features***\n#Real-Time Battles#\nBattles are not pre-calculated but happen in real time on the map. Anyone can join or leave a battle at any time, allowing true RTS gameplay. See an ally being attacked right in your backyard? Send some troops to help your buddy out, or launch a surprise counterattack on the attacker’s city. \n\n#Seamless World Map#\nAll in-game action takes place on a single, enormous map inhabited by players and NPC characters. No isolated bases or separate battle screens. Never before seen on mobile “infinite zoom” feature allows you to transition freely between the world view and individual cities or barbarian outposts. Map features include natural obstructions such as rivers and mountain ranges and strategic passes that must be captured to gain entrance to neighboring regions.\n\n#Eleven Unique Civilizations#\nChoose one of 11 historical civilizations (more to come!) and guide your civilization from a lone clan into a great power. Each civilization has its own architecture, unique units, and special advantages.\n\n#Exploration &amp; Investigation#\nThe world of Rise of Kingdoms is covered in thick fog. Dispatch scouts to explore this mysterious land and uncover the hidden treasure within. Investigate lost temples, barbarian fortresses, mysterious caves, and tribal villages, gather intelligence on your enemies, and prepare yourself for the ultimate clash! \n\n#Unrestricted Troop Movements#\nNew orders can be issued to troops at any time, offering limitless strategic possibilities. Launch a feint at an enemy city, then circle back and meet up with your alliance army to capture a pass. Dispatch troops to collect lumber from a nearby forest and have them pick off a few barbarian clans along the way. Forces can also be split up between multiple commanders so that you can engage in multiple actions simultaneously.\n\n#Alliance System#\nFull set of alliance features allow players to help one another: alliance chat with built-in translation function, officer roles, map indicators to coordinate strategies, and more! Alliances can expand their territory to gain resources, capture mountain passes and barbarian outposts to strengthen their position, and work together to unlock group achievements.\n\n#Conquer the Kingdom#\nFight alongside your alliance to take control of this vast kingdom.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Infinite zoom, realistic battles, limitless possibilities. Strategy lives here!<br /><br />11 Civilizations, 34 Heroes, Real Warfare<br />  <br />From the depths of obscurity to the peaks of legend, you will be the author of your civilization&#39;s history. Will you launch epic wars and conquer the entire world? Or rise up as a virtuous leader renowned for your sagacity? Will you set off to explore the unknown as a pioneer? Or dedicate yourself to helping your own people?<br /> <br />Only time will tell...<br /> <br />***Features***<br />#Real-Time Battles#<br />Battles are not pre-calculated but happen in real time on the map. Anyone can join or leave a battle at any time, allowing true RTS gameplay. See an ally being attacked right in your backyard? Send some troops to help your buddy out, or launch a surprise counterattack on the attacker’s city. <br /><br />#Seamless World Map#<br />All in-game action takes place on a single, enormous map inhabited by players and NPC characters. No isolated bases or separate battle screens. Never before seen on mobile “infinite zoom” feature allows you to transition freely between the world view and individual cities or barbarian outposts. Map features include natural obstructions such as rivers and mountain ranges and strategic passes that must be captured to gain entrance to neighboring regions.<br /><br />#Eleven Unique Civilizations#<br />Choose one of 11 historical civilizations (more to come!) and guide your civilization from a lone clan into a great power. Each civilization has its own architecture, unique units, and special advantages.<br /><br />#Exploration &amp; Investigation#<br />The world of Rise of Kingdoms is covered in thick fog. Dispatch scouts to explore this mysterious land and uncover the hidden treasure within. Investigate lost temples, barbarian fortresses, mysterious caves, and tribal villages, gather intelligence on your enemies, and prepare yourself for the ultimate clash! <br /><br />#Unrestricted Troop Movements#<br />New orders can be issued to troops at any time, offering limitless strategic possibilities. Launch a feint at an enemy city, then circle back and meet up with your alliance army to capture a pass. Dispatch troops to collect lumber from a nearby forest and have them pick off a few barbarian clans along the way. Forces can also be split up between multiple commanders so that you can engage in multiple actions simultaneously.<br /><br />#Alliance System#<br />Full set of alliance features allow players to help one another: alliance chat with built-in translation function, officer roles, map indicators to coordinate strategies, and more! Alliances can expand their territory to gain resources, capture mountain passes and barbarian outposts to strengthen their position, and work together to unlock group achievements.<br /><br />#Conquer the Kingdom#<br />Fight alongside your alliance to take control of this vast kingdom. Clash with other players and use superior tactics to emerge victorious in a MMO strategy battle royale. Rise to the top and you and your civilization will be written down in your kingdom’s history!<br /><br />#RPG Commanders#<br />Call upon dozens of historical figures who will serve as your trustworthy commanders, from Julius Caesar and Sun Tzu to Joan of Arc and Kusunoki Masashige. Level up your commanders by defeating barbarians and sending them into battles, then upgrade their abilities using an RPG style talent tree and skill system.<br /> <br />*Expedition Mode<br />*Infinite Zoom--never before seen on mobile!<br />*Scouting<br />*Espionage<br />*Kingdom Progression<br />*Civilization Specific Cities<br />*Stunning Graphics<br />*3D Character Models<br />And more…<br /> <br />Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/riseofkingdomsgame</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>1. “Happy Spring Festival” Events (Will go live within 3 weeks after the update)<br />The sound of firecrackers sends off a year gone past, while the gleam of lanterns welcomes the year to come. The Spring Festival is fast approaching, and you can feel it in the air! We have prepared some fantastic Spring Festival events, a limited-edition theme, and other great rewards!<br />-Happy Year of the Ox: 7 days of questing for great rewards!<br />-Lanterns of Togetherness: Decorate a Flower Lantern to celebrate the Spring Festival! Win great prizes like a limited-edition city theme and decorations!<br />-New Year’s Gifts: Collect Colored Papers to use in the “Lanterns of Togetherness” event.<br />-Arms Training: Challenge an Armsmaster Lohar who gets stronger with each battle! How long can you last?<br />-Strange Incidents: The village is on fire?!? As you help the villagers, you may find things are not as simple as they seem...<br /><br />See the Event Calendar for a detailed schedule.<br /><br />2. “Ark of Osiris” Optimizations<br />In order to ensure Governors can have the battles of their dreams, to make room for more tactics and skill expression, and to bring the fun of Ark of Osiris to even more Governors, we will be making the following adjustments:<br />1) In order to allow more alliances to participate without making significant changes to the current rules, alliances that are not in the top 20 of their kingdom will now be able to take part in Ark of Osiris, grouped separately with other alliances of similar power levels. For exact details, please see the event page after the update.<br />2) Increased the number of teleports earned after the first occupation of an Obelisk from 5 to 8. Teleports can now be used even if troops are not in a building.<br />3) Removed the “Divine Aid” skill and adjusted the effects of other skills. Adjusted skill effects will be viewable from the Ark of Osiris page after the update.<br />4) Adjusted the rules for occupying buildings. First occupations will now take 3 minutes, and further occupations will take 2 minutes.<br />5) Adjusted the rules for gaining Energy Points. Energy Points are now gained faster. Alliances will no longer get a boost to their Energy Points after suffering heavy troop losses, but alliances on the side currently losing will get a boost.<br />6) Optimized the Ark of Osiris map display.<br />7) Significantly increased the rate at which severely wounded units are healed.<br />8) Reduced alliance score earned from caravan visits, but individual score will not be affected.<br /><br />3. “Lost Kingdom” Optimizations<br />All Seasons:<br />1) During the “Eve of the Crusade” event, the gathering speed bonus awarded to the 4th place kingdom has been increased from +5% to +15%.<br />2) When a kingdom enters “Eve of the Crusade” for Season 1, the “Resource Reserves” bundle will be replaced with the “Bumper Harvest” bundle.<br /> <br />Season 2 only:<br />1) The Lost Kingdom preparation event will be split into a Preparation stage and a Matchmaking stage. Governors will be unable to immigrate to kingdoms in the Matchmaking stage.<br /> <br />Season of Conquest only:<br />1) Optimized the logic for refreshing Bastion quests to ensure that refreshing will not give the same quest.<br />2) Optimized the Bastion window display to include the Bastion’s level.<br />3) Lowered the power of Kahar the Hidden.<br />4) Reduced the upgrade time required for certain levels of the Crystal Mine and Crystal Research Center, as well as for some Crystal Research Center technologies.<br />5) Added crystals to the potential reward pool for defeating barbarians and destroying barbarian forts.<br />6) When an alliance joins or leaves a coalition, any ongoing rallies launched by alliance members will now be automatically cancelled.<br /> <br />4. Other Optimizations</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So I don’t usually write a review but I needed to write one so I love this game  I play 2-3 hours a day or all day and my family think it’s weird of me playing for that long and I usually play for 25 minutes each day but I play more than that on this game I have had it for a year now and it’s amazing and I love everything but there are a few things that I don’t like but it’s not a big deal so number 1. When you train your troops it also takes away your wood and food and I really don’t like that but like I said before it’s not a big deal. Number 2. I don’t like how you have to wait a lot on updating your castle like you have to wait at least 30 days or more  and went your going to level 11 on your castle you have to wait a day for that like I don’t think you have to wait that long just to upgrade. Number 3. I know for a fact that a lot of people will agree with this and it’s editing your space so I know people like doing that but like once you are done like it won’t let you because you have to finish your lay out let’s just call it like that and it has happened a lot I would really appreciate it if you would fix that. Number 4. I really don’t like how you have to be at level 8 and up to attack I really think you should be at level 7 and up but rather than that I think you should download this game it’s really fun  and I love playing it thank you for reading my review have a nice day ❤️</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hey devs and other people viewing this. This is a fun game I’ve met people etc, and there’s very fun things that I love about this game, I’ve maybe have been playing about a 3-4 weeks. But there’s one thing that I absolutely hate and recommend that you get rid of is (immigration) My kingdom that i just started in I’m around 1 mil has been flooded with people from different kingdoms. Yes it brings fun and etc but when three different alliances do it , it messes up a lot of things. A lot of my friends and people I’ve met off this game quit because these alliances decimated new beginning one and other alliances from the same kingdom. Today passes open and only one of the original alliances got a pass. This concept can really ruin a lot of players fun for the game. Especially alliance hopping and etc it just ruins a lot of things for people who are still learning about the game. You should really consider fixing the immigration system and maybe trying something else new or just throw it out the window. Like I mean the second our kingdom opened up to immigration it was taken over. All aside from that this game is decent. It’s fun addicting but you can ruin a lot of people fun by doing that. Or putting newer players into kingdoms that have already started and are almost finished. It’s disappointing honestly how the rewarding system honors cheap play. Good day to you devs I’m not mad and I’ll still play I’m just disappointed.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Greetings Governor, thanks for your feedback. For the situation you faced, we suggest you communicate with that alliance. If your alliance members need to through the pass, you can attack and through it, and don&#39;t send assist troops in it. Other event rewards or territory-related problems, you also could have a discussion and make a decision. We&#39;re constantly improving the game to bring you a better gameplay experience and you are welcome to put forward your opinion. We&#39;re glad to hear it. We wish you a nice day! Best wishes!

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Honestly probably the most well developed free game I have ever played only thing about it is it is very easy for players to put to win. I’ve been playing the game for about a year or so. So there is a lot to do and plenty of content and events but if your alliance doesn’t have what is known as a whale or two you’re pretty much screwed. So players that appreciate the game and how it has been developed really get screwed over. I understand the need for in game purchases as it is a free to play game but when the whole game is based around a competitive multiplayer world where everyone is racing to get troop tier five anyone who is able to drop hundreds to thousands of dollars on the game are able to dominate the servers and can switch between them. God forbid that one alliance consists of all of the whales in the server that entire server would become unplayable. And for those of you still confused as to what a whale is it’s someone who pays to be months ahead of everyone else so that way they can essentially one hit you or dominate the world without fear. If the developers would just slowly but surely shift the purchases to purely cosmetic the game would be 100x better. Or even make the vip system account based as opposed to character based. Understand the game is very dynamic and ever changing just be wary of the pay to win system</p>

“Happy Spring Festival” Events (Will go live within 3 weeks after the update)\nThe sound of firecrackers sends off a year gone past, while the gleam of lanterns welcomes the year to come. The Spring Festival is fast approaching, and you can feel it in the air! We have prepared some fantastic Spring Festival events, a limited-edition theme, and other great rewards!\n-Happy Year of the Ox: 7 days of questing for great rewards!\n-Lanterns of Togetherness: Decorate a Flower Lantern to celebrate the Spring Festival! Win great prizes like a limited-edition city theme and decorations!\n-New Year’s Gifts: Collect Colored Papers to use in the “Lanterns of Togetherness” event.\n-Arms Training: Challenge an Armsmaster Lohar who gets stronger with each battle! How long can you last?\n-Strange Incidents: The village is on fire?!? As you help the villagers, you may find things are not as simple as they seem...\n\nSee the Event Calendar for a detailed schedule.\n\n2. “Ark of Osiris” Optimizations\nIn order to ensure Governors can have the battles of their dreams, to make room for more tactics and skill expression, and to bring the fun of Ark of Osiris to even more Governors, we will be making the following adjustments:\n1) In order to allow more alliances to participate without making significant changes to the current rules, alliances that are not in the top 20 of their kingdom will now be able to take part in Ark of Osiris, grouped separately with other alliances of similar power levels. For exact details, please see the event page after the update.\n2) Increased the number of teleports earned after the first occupation of an Obelisk from 5 to 8. Teleports can now be used even if troops are not in a building.\n3) Removed the “Divine Aid” skill and adjusted the effects of other skills. Adjusted skill effects will be viewable from the Ark of Osiris page after the update.\n4) Adjusted the rules for occupying buildings. First occupations will now take 3 minutes, and further occupations will take 2 minutes.\n5) Adjusted the rules for gaining Energy Points. Energy Points are now gained faster. Alliances will no longer get a boost to their Energy Points after suffering heavy troop losses, but alliances on the side currently losing will get a boost.\n6) Optimized the Ark of Osiris map display.\n7) Significantly increased the rate at which severely wounded units are healed.\n8) Reduced alliance score earned from caravan visits, but individual score will not be affected.\n\n3. “Lost Kingdom” Optimizations\nAll Seasons:\n1) During the “Eve of the Crusade” event, the gathering speed bonus awarded to the 4th place kingdom has been increased from +5% to +15%.\n2) When a kingdom enters “Eve of the Crusade” for Season 1, the “Resource Reserves” bundle will be replaced with the “Bumper Harvest” bundle.\n \nSeason 2 only:\n1) The Lost Kingdom preparation event will be split into a Preparation stage and a Matchmaking stage. Governors will be unable to immigrate to kingdoms in the Matchmaking stage.\n \nSeason of Conquest only:\n1) Optimized the logic for refreshing Bastion quests to ensure that refreshing will not give the same quest.\n2) Optimized the Bastion window display to include the Bastion’s level.\n3) Lowered the power of Kahar the Hidden.\n4) Reduced the upgrade time required for certain levels of the Crystal Mine and Crystal Research Center, as well as for some Crystal Research Center technologies.\n5) Added crystals to the potential reward pool for defeating barbarians and destroying barbarian forts.\n6) When an alliance joins or leaves a coalition, any ongoing rallies launched by alliance members will now be automatically cancelled.\n \n4.

You can use them in the \"Branching Out\" event.\r\n - Branching Out: Use Branches to help grow your sapling, earning abundant rewards.\r\n - Reach for the Top: Become a powerhouse in your kingdom and earn a brand new city theme -- Amber Fortress!\r\n - Arms Training: Are you ready for Armsmaster Lohar's spring training sessions? Lohar gets stronger as training goes on, just how much can you endure?\r\n  \r\n [\"Ark of Osiris\" Event Optimizations]\r\n Based on Governors' feedback on their game play experience during the Ark of Osiris, and based on the preference to have more opportunities to practice the Osiris League, we have implemented a boatload of updates:\r\n 1) Added Practice Matches to the Ark of Osiris. From Mondays to Fridays, alliance leaders or titled officers can spend Gems to unlock a session of Practice Match for alliance members to practice with.\r\n 2) Optimized the battle results mail for the Ark of Osiris. Now statistics such as individual healing and more are shown in the mail.\r\n 3) Alliance skills and commander equipment will take effect as normal during the Ark of Osiris.\r\n 4) Support your favorite alliance in an all new bets event during the Osiris League!\r\n 5) The skills system will be added in after the Osiris League enters the Playoffs. Show off your big brain plays!\r\n 6) Locked commanders can now be dispatched as normal during the Ark of Osiris.\r\n 7) To prevent Governors from using up Teleport chances by accident, a short cooldown has been added to Teleport.\r\n \r\n [Other Changes]\r\n 1) Added a ton of personal achievements. Also added a new category of achievements. Governors can now choose to display certain achievements in their personal information.\r\n 2) Defeating the chieftains of Barbarian Camps and Barbarian Keeps will grant even higher chances of dropping equipment blueprints.\r\n 3) For kills that happen during rally battles, the damage will now be more accurately accredited to Governors that participated in these battles.\r\n 4) Optimized album display. Governors who had uploaded a photo will now have an even more obvious indicator in the personal information panel.\r\n 5) Special Immigration chances of Imperium Kingdoms will now accumulate at the beginning of each month if not used up, to a maximum of 3 chances.\r\n 6) During the Past Glory event, Governors can now donate Elite Commander Sculptures and Epic Commander Sculptures.\r\n 7) All individual rankings will now display the top 1000 Governors. A new personal achievements ranking has been added.\r\n 8) Double tap the avatar of your army on the right to quick select all troops within that army.\r\n 9) When attacking troops during a rally, we can now use multi-selection as normal. Governors can do this by double tapping their own troops on the map, or by double tapping on the army's avatar by the right.\r\n 10) Based on Governors' feedback, we have modified the reward rules for the Ceroli Crisis (4 Players), and added two new generals for Governors to challenge. Now Governors can earn exclusive currency used to exchange for special rewards by playing the Ceroli Crisis (4 Players) event, which opens up once every two weeks.\r\n 11) Made a minor adjustment to area attack skills. These skills will now choose targets from all enemy Governor troops that are currently attacking you and are within the skill's area effect.","releaseDate":"2020-03-24"}],"hasPrivacyPolicyText":false,"promotionalText":"Infinite zoom, realistic battles, limitless possibilities.

Launch a feint at an enemy city, then circle back and meet up with your alliance army to capture a pass. Dispatch troops to collect lumber from a nearby forest and have them pick off a few barbarian clans along the way. Forces can also be split up between multiple commanders so that you can engage in multiple actions simultaneously.\n\n#Alliance System#\nFull set of alliance features allow players to help one another: alliance chat with built-in translation function, officer roles, map indicators to coordinate strategies, and more!

I don’t usually write a review but I needed to write one so I love this game  I play 2-3 hours a day or all day and my family think it’s weird of me playing for that long and I usually play for 25 minutes each day but I play more than that on this game I have had it for a year now and it’s amazing and I love everything but there are a few things that I don’t like but it’s not a big deal so number 1. When you train your troops it also takes away your wood and food and I really don’t like that but like I said before it’s not a big deal. Number 2. I don’t like how you have to wait a lot on updating your castle like you have to wait at least 30 days or more  and went your going to level 11 on your castle you have to wait a day for that like I don’t think you have to wait that long just to upgrade. Number 3. I know for a fact that a lot of people will agree with this and it’s editing your space so I know people like doing that but like once you are done like it won’t let you because you have to finish your lay out let’s just call it like that and it has happened a lot I would really appreciate it if you would fix that. Number 4.

This is a fun game I’ve met people etc, and there’s very fun things that I love about this game, I’ve maybe have been playing about a 3-4 weeks. But there’s one thing that I absolutely hate and recommend that you get rid of is (immigration) My kingdom that i just started in I’m around 1 mil has been flooded with people from different kingdoms. Yes it brings fun and etc but when three different alliances do it , it messes up a lot of things. A lot of my friends and people I’ve met off this game quit because these alliances decimated new beginning one and other alliances from the same kingdom. Today passes open and only one of the original alliances got a pass. This concept can really ruin a lot of players fun for the game. Especially alliance hopping and etc it just ruins a lot of things for people who are still learning about the game. You should really consider fixing the immigration system and maybe trying something else new or just throw it out the window. Like I mean the second our kingdom opened up to immigration it was taken over. All aside from that this game is decent. It’s fun addicting but you can ruin a lot of people fun by doing that. Or putting newer players into kingdoms that have already started and are almost finished. It’s disappointing honestly how the rewarding system honors cheap play. Good day to you devs I’m not mad and I’ll still play I’m just disappointed.","title":"Fun","userName":"Amosc: Tmalone30"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6226081086","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-22T01:34:09Z","rating":4,"review":"Honestly probably the most well developed free game I have ever played only thing about it is it is very easy for players to put to win. I’ve been playing the game for about a year or so. So there is a lot to do and plenty of content and events but if your alliance doesn’t have what is known as a whale or two you’re pretty much screwed. So players that appreciate the game and how it has been developed really get screwed over. I understand the need for in game purchases as it is a free to play game but when the whole game is based around a competitive multiplayer world where everyone is racing to get troop tier five anyone who is able to drop hundreds to thousands of dollars on the game are able to dominate the servers and can switch between them. God forbid that one alliance consists of all of the whales in the server that entire server would become unplayable. And for those of you still confused as to what a whale is it’s someone who pays to be months ahead of everyone else so that way they can essentially one hit you or dominate the world without fear. If the developers would just slowly but surely shift the purchases to purely cosmetic the game would be 100x better. Or even make the vip system account based as opposed to character based.

The game mechanics are amazing, I love the fog of war idea, and the fact that each commander speaks their native language and not English. And as a Roman and Byzantium history nerd, I love the fact that the Latin in the game is quite decent compared to other games (it isn’t perfect, but that is what you get from a dead language that doesn’t translate well into other languages).\n\nNow, I feel like the nations to choose from is very limiting. From a game about the ancient and medieval ages, Africa and the Middle East were left out, and they have some of the richest history during that time, from the African Empires that rose to power all the way to the Persian empire and the crusades.\n\nSpecifically, I would like to see three more nations added: Ethiopia, Egypt, and Persia. Ethiopia rose to power after the fall of the Roman Empire and remained a powerful nation until after WW2. Persia created a very advanced civilization that grew strong and powerful and became one of the largest empires until the greeks conquered it. Then the Persian Empire reformed itself as the Sassanian Empire and conquered the remaining Romans and Byzantines to form the Ottoman Empire. I do not know much on the history of Egypt, but as one of the first powerful civilizations in human history, it should be obvious why they should be added into the game.","title":"Really great game, but not complete","userName":"DJWicki"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4589553241","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-08-09T06:39:47Z","developerResponse":{"id":10103302,"body":"Greetings Governor, after the activity was abnormal, some players obtained a large amount of illegal Osiris coins and used them to exchange the props.

Seems the devs made some error in rewards during Osiris and gave out more coins then they intended. They took back items purchased or unused coins so many of us now have negative stars/statues/keys. It’s a shame that this company chose to punish their customers for their mistake. I will most likely quit the game because of this; I’m just too discouraged by the setback and disregard of the company for their players.\n\nI have been playing several hours a day, every day, for 8 months and, with about $75 invested, am CH25 but still only at 22mil power on this account. Significant , but not really that competitive over all. I am being held back by the need for gems that require real money to make any significant difference. Meanwhile, as others note, there are players who spend thousands of dollars and therefore have the ability, and sometimes the temperament, to flatten any in their way. I had quit an earlier game because of one such player and have had 3 teammates quit just this week in current kingdom because of this. Some of the events, like mighty governor, are always won by the high dollar p2w. It is no longer competitive nor fun so I no longer even try to earn a spot; I just cower in my city during KE. There needs to be a threshold for the p2w folks. For example, once you spend over, say, $500 or reach 50 million power, you must migrate to kingdoms set aside for those players.","title":"Could be a great game but too much p2w","userName":"GrubbyGrapes"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4307750119","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-06-13T06:11:20Z","developerResponse":{"id":9161231,"body":"Greetings Governor, thanks for your feedback.

I want to say that I have mixed feelings about this app. I’ll start with that this game is really well built. The graphics, the idea, and the system in game is set up good. I like a lot about it. But, if I could change one thing or even have a compromise. My one wish that I wish I could see is the game to release pure f2p kingdoms but you must pay to get in (something like $5-$10 for entry) and once you are in. There is no p2w elements. No micro transactions. Everyone is on fair playing grounds at the start. If that could be added to the game. I feel like that this game will take over the genre and be over the top because to players, that won’t seem like much money to enter and they can test the game out on the kingdom servers we have now to see if they actually like the game itself and from these reviews. People really like the game but not the p2w aspect. The p2w aspect is bringing it down heavily and players are leaving because of it. I myself am not returning to the game till something changes to where there is no p2w aspects or there is an option to what I proposed with the f2p kingdoms being available, but with a entry fee. I feel like that is a fair compromise where the players get what they want and the company still makes a lot of money. I will happily come back and play and waste all of my hours on this game if that proposal gets accepted.","title":"If I had one wish","userName":"cmccauley43"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6794471848","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-12-26T06:23:50Z","rating":3,"review":"This is an amazing game and honestly I don’t have many negative opinions towards it. The problem comes when you are f2p. Upon entering a new server you will have approximately a month before you are essentially pushed out of a lot of end game content because you are viewed as being “too weak” compared to the players that have bought their way to having very high power. They will eventually all group together and keep you from being able to join a lot of the later content. As a F2P player you have you find yourself being content with the constant threats of being kicked out of stronger alliances because of low power since you can’t keep up with spenders and eventually being kicked out or being content with just farming and doing the same round of events every few weeks. Kingdom vs Kingdom won’t happen in most cases because you won’t be allowed. I’ve started in many many different servers over the past 2 years and it always happens the same way. If you can afford to pour money into this game, then I totally recommend it. If your like me and can’t afford to spend tons of money on a mobile game then go in understanding that after around a month, maybe a little longer, your going to be seen as useless because you won’t be able to keep up with the spenders.","title":"Great game but short for f2p","userName":"IamHalfprice"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"7081782947","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-03-09T03:39:36Z","developerResponse":{"id":21557141,"body":"Greetings Governor, as we add in-game content, it will be reflected in our ads.

I can’t express enough how clickbait these ads are and I’m warning everyone who plays this IT IS NOTHING LIKE THE GAME! The ads started out fine saying you start with a kingdom and work your way up to be among the best of the kingdoms, but now they say stuff like “oH nO mY kInGdOm Is UnDeR aTtAcK i’M gOnNa HaVe To FlEe” which is another thing you can’t do in this game you can’t do anything it says you can in the ads. It is the most scummy thing I’ve ever seen, it gets little kids to think they’re gonna play a really cool kingdom game where you play as a king roaming around the kingdom, but when they get it they just get a mediocre game that you only really play once and has very little game mechanics. I know that the developers won’t respond because they are a bunch of low life scum bag cowards, so here is a message to the developer- Reply to me like a man and I don’t want some robot auto response I want a real human response and demand to change the ads so they are not clickbait, otherwise you will be a coward for not responding to me and a scum bag for scamming kids.

I never had problems like this when I started (I like the game itself). I put my devoted energy into building a strong city, and I was a head of a small alliance, but now, especially in the last weeks, other players have begun to blatantly break the rules, and they are now randomly attacking smaller players and alliances. \n\nThey justify this by their own rules. The leader of the main alliance sent me messages ordering me to disband our alliance (we’ve all been working together to build this, of course). His is just a plot to snatch the weaker territories. They send renegades who join our alliance, attack others at free will, then leave quickly. We get blamed, and then just yesterday, my city was attacked, I lost all my newest troops. Last week a stalker teleported on the border of our territory, and attacked all of our farmers, he sent a message “it was fun feeding off you”. This stuff is only allowed during certain events in the game.\n\nSo yesterday I quit. I disbanded, and I don’t think I want to play the game anymore. If you don’t want frustrations and heartache over lost troops (for no reason), then don’t start playing this game.

Games © 2013 - 2021","description":{"standard":"11 Civilizations, 34 Heroes, Real Warfare\n  \nFrom the depths of obscurity to the peaks of legend, you will be the author of your civilization's history. Will you launch epic wars and conquer the entire world? Or rise up as a virtuous leader renowned for your sagacity? Will you set off to explore the unknown as a pioneer? Or dedicate yourself to helping your own people?\n \nOnly time will tell...\n \n***Features***\n#Real-Time Battles#\nBattles are not pre-calculated but happen in real time on the map. Anyone can join or leave a battle at any time, allowing true RTS gameplay. See an ally being attacked right in your backyard? Send some troops to help your buddy out, or launch a surprise counterattack on the attacker’s city. \n\n#Seamless World Map#\nAll in-game action takes place on a single, enormous map inhabited by players and NPC characters. No isolated bases or separate battle screens. Never before seen on mobile “infinite zoom” feature allows you to transition freely between the world view and individual cities or barbarian outposts. Map features include natural obstructions such as rivers and mountain ranges and strategic passes that must be captured to gain entrance to neighboring regions.\n\n#Eleven Unique Civilizations#\nChoose one of 11 historical civilizations (more to come!) and guide your civilization from a lone clan into a great power. Each civilization has its own architecture, unique units, and special advantages.\n\n#Exploration \u0026 Investigation#\nThe world of Rise of Kingdoms is covered in thick fog. Dispatch scouts to explore this mysterious land and uncover the hidden treasure within. Investigate lost temples, barbarian fortresses, mysterious caves, and tribal villages, gather intelligence on your enemies, and prepare yourself for the ultimate clash! \n\n#Unrestricted Troop Movements#\nNew orders can be issued to troops at any time, offering limitless strategic possibilities. Launch a feint at an enemy city, then circle back and meet up with your alliance army to capture a pass. Dispatch troops to collect lumber from a nearby forest and have them pick off a few barbarian clans along the way. Forces can also be split up between multiple commanders so that you can engage in multiple actions simultaneously.\n\n#Alliance System#\nFull set of alliance features allow players to help one another: alliance chat with built-in translation function, officer roles, map indicators to coordinate strategies, and more! Alliances can expand their territory to gain resources, capture mountain passes and barbarian outposts to strengthen their position, and work together to unlock group achievements.\n\n#Conquer the Kingdom#\nFight alongside your alliance to take control of this vast kingdom. Clash with other players and use superior tactics to emerge victorious in a MMO strategy battle royale. Rise to the top and you and your civilization will be written down in your kingdom’s history!\n\n#RPG Commanders#\nCall upon dozens of historical figures who will serve as your trustworthy commanders, from Julius Caesar and Sun Tzu to Joan of Arc and Kusunoki Masashige. Level up your commanders by defeating barbarians and sending them into battles, then upgrade their abilities using an RPG style talent tree and skill system.\n \n*Expedition Mode\n*Infinite Zoom--never before seen on mobile!\n*Scouting\n*Espionage\n*Kingdom Progression\n*Civilization Specific Cities\n*Stunning Graphics\n*3D Character Models\nAnd more…\n \nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/riseofkingdomsgame"},"versionHistory":[{"versionDisplay":"1.0.43.13","releaseNotes":"1. “Happy Spring Festival” Events (Will go live within 3 weeks after the update)\nThe sound of firecrackers sends off a year gone past, while the gleam of lanterns welcomes the year to come. The Spring Festival is fast approaching, and you can feel it in the air! We have prepared some fantastic Spring Festival events, a limited-edition theme, and other great rewards!\n-Happy Year of the Ox: 7 days of questing for great rewards!\n-Lanterns of Togetherness: Decorate a Flower Lantern to celebrate the Spring Festival! Win great prizes like a limited-edition city theme and decorations!\n-New Year’s Gifts: Collect Colored Papers to use in the “Lanterns of Togetherness” event.\n-Arms Training: Challenge an Armsmaster Lohar who gets stronger with each battle! How long can you last?\n-Strange Incidents: The village is on fire?!? As you help the villagers, you may find things are not as simple as they seem...\n\nSee the Event Calendar for a detailed schedule.\n\n2. “Ark of Osiris” Optimizations\nIn order to ensure Governors can have the battles of their dreams, to make room for more tactics and skill expression, and to bring the fun of Ark of Osiris to even more Governors, we will be making the following adjustments:\n1) In order to allow more alliances to participate without making significant changes to the current rules, alliances that are not in the top 20 of their kingdom will now be able to take part in Ark of Osiris, grouped separately with other alliances of similar power levels. For exact details, please see the event page after the update.\n2) Increased the number of teleports earned after the first occupation of an Obelisk from 5 to 8. Teleports can now be used even if troops are not in a building.\n3) Removed the “Divine Aid” skill and adjusted the effects of other skills. Adjusted skill effects will be viewable from the Ark of Osiris page after the update.\n4) Adjusted the rules for occupying buildings. First occupations will now take 3 minutes, and further occupations will take 2 minutes.\n5) Adjusted the rules for gaining Energy Points. Energy Points are now gained faster. Alliances will no longer get a boost to their Energy Points after suffering heavy troop losses, but alliances on the side currently losing will get a boost.\n6) Optimized the Ark of Osiris map display.\n7) Significantly increased the rate at which severely wounded units are healed.\n8) Reduced alliance score earned from caravan visits, but individual score will not be affected.\n\n3. “Lost Kingdom” Optimizations\nAll Seasons:\n1) During the “Eve of the Crusade” event, the gathering speed bonus awarded to the 4th place kingdom has been increased from +5% to +15%.\n2) When a kingdom enters “Eve of the Crusade” for Season 1, the “Resource Reserves” bundle will be replaced with the “Bumper Harvest” bundle.\n \nSeason 2 only:\n1) The Lost Kingdom preparation event will be split into a Preparation stage and a Matchmaking stage. Governors will be unable to immigrate to kingdoms in the Matchmaking stage.\n \nSeason of Conquest only:\n1) Optimized the logic for refreshing Bastion quests to ensure that refreshing will not give the same quest.\n2) Optimized the Bastion window display to include the Bastion’s level.\n3) Lowered the power of Kahar the Hidden.\n4) Reduced the upgrade time required for certain levels of the Crystal Mine and Crystal Research Center, as well as for some Crystal Research Center technologies.\n5) Added crystals to the potential reward pool for defeating barbarians and destroying barbarian forts.\n6) When an alliance joins or leaves a coalition, any ongoing rallies launched by alliance members will now be automatically cancelled.\n \n4.

You can use them in the \"Branching Out\" event.\r\n - Branching Out: Use Branches to help grow your sapling, earning abundant rewards.\r\n - Reach for the Top: Become a powerhouse in your kingdom and earn a brand new city theme -- Amber Fortress!\r\n - Arms Training: Are you ready for Armsmaster Lohar's spring training sessions? Lohar gets stronger as training goes on, just how much can you endure?\r\n  \r\n [\"Ark of Osiris\" Event Optimizations]\r\n Based on Governors' feedback on their game play experience during the Ark of Osiris, and based on the preference to have more opportunities to practice the Osiris League, we have implemented a boatload of updates:\r\n 1) Added Practice Matches to the Ark of Osiris. From Mondays to Fridays, alliance leaders or titled officers can spend Gems to unlock a session of Practice Match for alliance members to practice with.\r\n 2) Optimized the battle results mail for the Ark of Osiris. Now statistics such as individual healing and more are shown in the mail.\r\n 3) Alliance skills and commander equipment will take effect as normal during the Ark of Osiris.\r\n 4) Support your favorite alliance in an all new bets event during the Osiris League!\r\n 5) The skills system will be added in after the Osiris League enters the Playoffs. Show off your big brain plays!\r\n 6) Locked commanders can now be dispatched as normal during the Ark of Osiris.\r\n 7) To prevent Governors from using up Teleport chances by accident, a short cooldown has been added to Teleport.\r\n \r\n [Other Changes]\r\n 1) Added a ton of personal achievements. Also added a new category of achievements. Governors can now choose to display certain achievements in their personal information.\r\n 2) Defeating the chieftains of Barbarian Camps and Barbarian Keeps will grant even higher chances of dropping equipment blueprints.\r\n 3) For kills that happen during rally battles, the damage will now be more accurately accredited to Governors that participated in these battles.\r\n 4) Optimized album display. Governors who had uploaded a photo will now have an even more obvious indicator in the personal information panel.\r\n 5) Special Immigration chances of Imperium Kingdoms will now accumulate at the beginning of each month if not used up, to a maximum of 3 chances.\r\n 6) During the Past Glory event, Governors can now donate Elite Commander Sculptures and Epic Commander Sculptures.\r\n 7) All individual rankings will now display the top 1000 Governors. A new personal achievements ranking has been added.\r\n 8) Double tap the avatar of your army on the right to quick select all troops within that army.\r\n 9) When attacking troops during a rally, we can now use multi-selection as normal. Governors can do this by double tapping their own troops on the map, or by double tapping on the army's avatar by the right.\r\n 10) Based on Governors' feedback, we have modified the reward rules for the Ceroli Crisis (4 Players), and added two new generals for Governors to challenge. Now Governors can earn exclusive currency used to exchange for special rewards by playing the Ceroli Crisis (4 Players) event, which opens up once every two weeks.\r\n 11) Made a minor adjustment to area attack skills. These skills will now choose targets from all enemy Governor troops that are currently attacking you and are within the skill's area effect.","releaseDate":"2020-03-24"}],"languageList":["English","Arabic","French","German","Indonesian","Italian","Japanese","Kanuri","Korean","Malay","Polish","Portuguese","Russian","Simplified Chinese","Spanish","Thai","Traditional Chinese","Turkish","Vietnamese"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"privacyPolicyUrl":"http://www.lilithgames.com/privacy_lilith.html","requirementsString":"Requires iOS 10.0 or later.
