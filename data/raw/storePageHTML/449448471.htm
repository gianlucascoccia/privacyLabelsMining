(help others by sending them if you are trapped in a traffic jam)\n   · As soon as you open the app, incidents around you are shown here\n   · Traffic cameras: compare official information with images from the cameras (if your community / town-hall has cameras which are not in Skip Traffic, write to us and we will try to add them to the app, most of the communities do not have their own traffic service, but their cameras can be found in the DGT section). Organise them in mosaics and favourites. \n   · Zoom in to see gas stations with their prices, cameras and speed cams\n\n- GAS PRICE:\n   · Find gas stations on the “Traffic Map” (zoom in) or in “Routes” (they are ordered by price in each route you have created)\n   · Prices updated every minute\n   · Tap and hold for a second on the “Traffic Map” to find nearby gas stations ordered by price.\n   · Configure in settings how much you would like to deviate from your route to find cheap gas (cheap gas stations aren’t placed in main roads), a second gas type, and with how much zoom they are shown on the “Traffic Map”\n   · Create your gas station favourite list to check their prices easily\n\n- MORE:\n   · Choose the tab where the app is initiated according to what you use more: Warner, Traffic Map, or Routes.\n   · Warn your friends of problems in the road via WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, iMessage,…\n   · Traffic Alarms to remember checking the traffic and avoid traffic jams\n\n- The paid version (the “pro”) includes everything, it doesn’t have ads or in-app purchases. The free one has one in-app purchase which enables the automatic update of speed cams (the speed of speed cams is not shown on the Watch without this in-app purchase, although a general warning is given), removes the ads, and allows to chose dark/light mode independently of the iPhone settings. If you buy it, you would have the same functionality of the paid version.\n\nNOTES:\n\n- To use the Warner you need your device to have a GPS integrated: all iPhones have it, iPod and iPad WiFi do NOT have it (iPad 3G DOES have it). The rest of the functionality (routes, traffic, gas price) works in any device.\n\nATTENTION! The Speed Cam Warner uses your GPS. Continuos use of the warner in fore or background can drain your battery quickly.","screenshot":["https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/56/97/4a/56974a5f-143c-4bc8-f89a-b75080ea889d/0912ae98-5ca3-4067-824b-3ba376390b93_en_02.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/3a/96/9a/3a969a90-6b91-7ef5-1d73-1baebbcd4765/f63ef66d-c4bc-40b1-aaa7-dac7e581c85c_en_03.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/e3/17/65/e31765e8-aec1-22a1-5ea8-11bff33bcb44/26983649-97d1-4290-b428-cc6a20fca2c4_en_04.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/43/c8/e5/43c8e5f6-4bec-0370-ecd2-53c314b043f9/e2b39ad8-6a96-4ce3-b725-bf8d6a64790d_en_05.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/3f/92/88/3f92883e-ea69-7dd1-39d3-988d1db2d421/7c32b8c6-b52f-4cc9-a98e-c3eba211a815_en_06.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/01/d2/82/01d2826e-c47c-bbbf-8c3f-8a5eefb004b1/53081ce2-3ad4-42ac-8d95-82fa5b42bce2_en_01_01.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/b6/6d/f9/b66df9e9-bd38-5bcb-6f3a-d15aa6296a3a/c49dc694-fb71-42e8-8806-d56f3a08e34d_en_01_02.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/64/60/ae/6460ae59-a6b0-12fd-bd5d-5f4d98a97ad2/35697b70-af76-4e8f-b975-5829ce6b0613_en_01_03.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/d8/c6/64/d8c66440-c989-5e38-8778-54e194a60da7/161d65dd-b7c1-4f2e-85f5-67279b1fd432_en_02.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/58/3e/74/583e7480-9bbe-4fd6-1c22-8266ac52c765/d308ffac-48c2-40ae-a5c0-6cad1bd60bdf_en_03.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/0b/20/00/0b2000e9-0639-0286-90ff-6264125bcdce/34ac1d8a-7772-43b5-a418-076d5ffd3ed0_en_04.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/ec/71/31/ec713135-9293-8ec3-3de2-fd0d26d14e80/a0252a72-1da8-4e77-a636-1f6421dd3b18_en_05.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/c5/e3/bb/c5e3bbf6-401d-0b25-d980-47bf56d86145/509573b3-fc11-401a-9bab-a5427f9f9ba9_en_06.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/7d/60/a5/7d60a5f5-e1eb-05a7-0127-ee6cac0e76c3/887c271c-0995-41d4-a9aa-f9069dd106ca_en_01_01.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource124/v4/b0/e7/11/b0e71175-ff2e-a566-3e69-375730ff70be/f19331ad-68eb-4e67-834d-cd16ff446d8f_en_01_02.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource114/v4/78/d9/c8/78d9c88a-a06f-90e2-01dd-0210705ddfa3/c0a3d256-4762-4bcd-a27e-53ef9b1f83ba_en_01_03.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/b7/3c/e5/b73ce564-68ea-9f90-f6f2-b3ac62ccdd13/04614220-0477-4bd9-9028-ade56d83f80b_es_01.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/a9/19/86/a919861e-45a2-4aa0-0539-f38741e4924d/22e94b4f-e81d-4b16-a79b-b7220062aacb_es_02.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/76/ed/5a/76ed5adb-5313-be54-3a7e-fbe08760f12a/b8e25c8f-5066-49fd-b333-9e8c400bcba5_es_03_lite.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/3f/58/72/3f587257-0697-c744-a2c3-15d381836d3c/1d3cfce9-9109-4439-a0d3-1fd16888af18_es_04.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/bb/11/96/bb119656-0d3b-d8db-77d1-2275cee9bc0b/153bc28b-59bc-43b4-86a5-9fe24bb1eee1_es_05.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/a1/76/62/a176626c-7075-655e-9e22-bee32ccef23c/bf36de52-980f-4420-be92-63a357a8ffd6_es_06.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/5d/5c/b0/5d5cb0d3-8d00-82fd-19c2-3cd1c070aa3b/8c480d96-d122-4278-9f3a-b29ee2c2def0_es_07.png/300x0w.jpg"],"image":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/94/f4/77/94f477d7-860a-6378-5cd2-3ef44adc0186/AppIconLite-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-7-0-85-220.png/1200x630wa.png","applicationCategory":"Navigation","datePublished":"Jul 15, 2011","operatingSystem":"Requires iOS 13.0 and watchOS 6.0 or later.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The best Speedcam Warner, with traffic information and gas prices in Spain.<br /><br />- THE BEST SPEED CAM WARNER:<br />   · Warnings only in the direction you are moving<br />   · Options to silence the warnings if your speed is OK<br />   · Manual or automatic (depending on your speed) warning distance <br />   · Automatic speed cam updates<br />   · Voice, sound and vibration warnings, also in your Apple Watch<br />   · With speedometer or map with real time traffic (speed cams are shown / warned when you get close to one in the direction you are moving, distractions and false information are avoided this way while it lets you see the traffic)<br />   · Works in fore or background (use it at the same time as your navigator)<br />   · App for the Watch: save battery in your iPhone by turning off the screen, or use it together with your navigator by seeing warnings on the Watch<br />   · Warnings with notifications, you can use it with your iPhone screen off (and see the notifications in the watch if you have it)<br />   · Fully configurable<br />   · Portrait and landscape modes<br />   · Night mode<br />   · All speed cams in Spain, even the ones in traffic lights and area ones, in which your mean speed is calculated and shown.<br />   · No user account or register needed, just open the app and you are ready to go<br /><br />- ROUTES:<br />   · Create routes to find gas stations ordered by price, traffic cameras, speed cams and incidents on them.<br /><br />- TRAFFIC MAP:<br />   · Map with Google Traffic and incidents from DGT, SCT, Andorra and the town council of Zaragoza, apart from the incidents sent by the users of Skip Traffic! (help others by sending them if you are trapped in a traffic jam)<br />   · As soon as you open the app, incidents around you are shown here<br />   · Traffic cameras: compare official information with images from the cameras (if your community / town-hall has cameras which are not in Skip Traffic, write to us and we will try to add them to the app, most of the communities do not have their own traffic service, but their cameras can be found in the DGT section). Organise them in mosaics and favourites. <br />   · Zoom in to see gas stations with their prices, cameras and speed cams<br /><br />- GAS PRICE:<br />   · Find gas stations on the “Traffic Map” (zoom in) or in “Routes” (they are ordered by price in each route you have created)<br />   · Prices updated every minute<br />   · Tap and hold for a second on the “Traffic Map” to find nearby gas stations ordered by price.<br />   · Configure in settings how much you would like to deviate from your route to find cheap gas (cheap gas stations aren’t placed in main roads), a second gas type, and with how much zoom they are shown on the “Traffic Map”<br />   · Create your gas station favourite list to check their prices easily<br /><br />- MORE:<br />   · Choose the tab where the app is initiated according to what you use more: Warner, Traffic Map, or Routes.<br />   · Warn your friends of problems in the road via WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, iMessage,…<br />   · Traffic Alarms to remember checking the traffic and avoid traffic jams<br /><br />- The paid version (the “pro”) includes everything, it doesn’t have ads or in-app purchases. The free one has one in-app purchase which enables the automatic update of speed cams (the speed of speed cams is not shown on the Watch without this in-app purchase, although a general warning is given), removes the ads, and allows to chose dark/light mode independently of the iPhone settings. If you buy it, you would have the same functionality of the paid version.<br /><br />NOTES:<br /><br />- To use the Warner you need your device to have a GPS integrated: all iPhones have it, iPod and iPad WiFi do NOT have it (iPad 3G DOES have it). The rest of the functionality (routes, traffic, gas price) works in any device.<br /><br />ATTENTION! The Speed Cam Warner uses your GPS. Continuos use of the warner in fore or background can drain your battery quickly.</p>

(help others by sending them if you are trapped in a traffic jam)\n   · As soon as you open the app, incidents around you are shown here\n   · Traffic cameras: compare official information with images from the cameras (if your community / town-hall has cameras which are not in Skip Traffic, write to us and we will try to add them to the app, most of the communities do not have their own traffic service, but their cameras can be found in the DGT section). Organise them in mosaics and favourites. \n   · Zoom in to see gas stations with their prices, cameras and speed cams\n\n- GAS PRICE:\n   · Find gas stations on the “Traffic Map” (zoom in) or in “Routes” (they are ordered by price in each route you have created)\n   · Prices updated every minute\n   · Tap and hold for a second on the “Traffic Map” to find nearby gas stations ordered by price.\n   · Configure in settings how much you would like to deviate from your route to find cheap gas (cheap gas stations aren’t placed in main roads), a second gas type, and with how much zoom they are shown on the “Traffic Map”\n   · Create your gas station favourite list to check their prices easily\n\n- MORE:\n   · Choose the tab where the app is initiated according to what you use more: Warner, Traffic Map, or Routes.\n   · Warn your friends of problems in the road via WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, iMessage,…\n   · Traffic Alarms to remember checking the traffic and avoid traffic jams\n\n- The paid version (the “pro”) includes everything, it doesn’t have ads or in-app purchases. The free one has one in-app purchase which enables the automatic update of speed cams (the speed of speed cams is not shown on the Watch without this in-app purchase, although a general warning is given), removes the ads, and allows to chose dark/light mode independently of the iPhone settings. If you buy it, you would have the same functionality of the paid version.\n\nNOTES:\n\n- To use the Warner you need your device to have a GPS integrated: all iPhones have it, iPod and iPad WiFi do NOT have it (iPad 3G DOES have it). The rest of the functionality (routes, traffic, gas price) works in any device.\n\nATTENTION! The Speed Cam Warner uses your GPS. Continuos use of the warner in fore or background can drain your battery quickly."},"websiteUrl":"https://trafico-no-19e06.web.app","requiredCapabilities":"arm64 ","offers":[{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=0\u0026salableAdamId=449448471\u0026pricingParameters=STDQ\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=838466522","type":"get","priceFormatted":"$0.00","price":0,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":51846144}]},{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=0\u0026salableAdamId=449448471\u0026pricingParameters=SWUPD\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=838466522","type":"update","priceFormatted":"$0.00","price":0,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":51846144}]}]},"relationships":{"artwork":{"data":{"type":"image","id":"ember6538717"}},"circular-artwork":{"data":{"type":"image","id":"ember6538718"}}}}]},"genres":{"data":[{"id":"6010","type":"media/genre"},{"id":"6003","type":"media/genre"}]},"applewatchScreenshots":{"data":[{"id":"ember6538709","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538710","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538711","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538712","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538713","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538714","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538715","type":"image"}]},"ipadScreenshots":{"data":[{"id":"ember6538696","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538697","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538698","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538699","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538700","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538701","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538702","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538703","type":"image"}]},"iphoneScreenshots":{"data":[{"id":"ember6538688","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538689","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538690","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538691","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538692","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538693","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538694","type":"image"},{"id":"ember6538695","type":"image"}]},"customersAlsoBoughtApps":{"data":[{"id":"1068298078","type":"media/app"},{"id":"296739784","type":"media/app"},{"id":"1120207710","type":"media/app"},{"id":"457835128","type":"media/app"},{"id":"658204860","type":"media/app"},{"id":"901340797","type":"media/app"},{"id":"1431664935","type":"media/app"},{"id":"686440022","type":"media/app"},{"id":"1407339605","type":"media/app"},{"id":"885975369","type":"media/app"}],"meta":{"next":"/v1/catalog/us/apps/449448471/customers-also-bought-apps?l=en-US\u0026offset=13"}},"developer":{"data":{"id":"429739400","type":"media/developer"}},"developerOtherApps":{"data":[{"id":"891705758","type":"media/app"},{"id":"1131486510","type":"media/app"},{"id":"597233864","type":"media/app"},{"id":"891713089","type":"media/app"},{"id":"429739397","type":"media/app"}]},"merchandisedInApps":{"data":[]},"reviews":{"data":[{"id":"689609970","type":"media/review"},{"id":"6622561371","type":"media/review"}]},"topInApps":{"data":[{"id":"1478330815","type":"media/in-app"}]}}},"included":[{"id":"891705758","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1131486510","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"597233864","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"891713089","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"429739397","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"689609970","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2012-11-12T03:51:33Z","rating":5,"review":"Lo bueno es que puedo filtrar a Google trafic para ver el tráfico pero por Google maps no pasa nada ( lima )","title":"Buena App","userName":"iJean2"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6622561371","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-11-08T14:31:04Z","rating":1,"review":"Downloaded this app 3 times.

you are moving\n   · Options to silence the warnings if your speed is OK\n   · Manual or automatic (depending on your speed) warning distance \n   · Automatic speed cam updates\n   · Voice, sound and vibration warnings, also in your Apple Watch\n   · With speedometer or map with real time traffic (speed cams are shown / warned when you get close to one in the direction you are moving, distractions and false information are avoided this way while it lets you see the traffic)\n   · Works in fore or background (use it at the same time as your navigator)\n   · App for the Watch: save battery in your iPhone by turning off the screen, or use it together with your navigator by seeing warnings on the Watch\n   · Warnings with notifications, you can use it with your iPhone screen off (and see the notifications in the watch if you have it)\n   · Fully configurable\n   · Portrait and landscape modes\n   · Night mode\n   · All speed cams in Spain, even the ones in traffic lights and area ones, in which your mean speed is calculated and shown.\n   · No user account or register needed, just open the app and you are ready to go\n\n- ROUTES:\n   · Create routes to find gas stations ordered by price, traffic cameras, speed cams and incidents on them.\n\n- TRAFFIC MAP:\n   · Map with Google Traffic and incidents from DGT, SCT, Andorra and the town council of Zaragoza, apart from the incidents sent by the users of Skip Traffic! (help others by sending them if you are trapped in a traffic jam)\n   · As soon as you open the app, incidents around you are shown here\n   · Traffic cameras: compare official information with images from the cameras (if your community / town-hall has cameras which are not in Skip Traffic, write to us and we will try to add them to the app, most of the communities do not have their own traffic service, but their cameras can be found in the DGT section). Organise them in mosaics and favourites. \n   · Zoom in to see gas stations with their prices, cameras and speed cams\n\n- GAS PRICE:\n   · Find gas stations on the “Traffic Map” (zoom in) or in “Routes” (they are ordered by price in each route you have created)\n   · Prices updated every minute\n   · Tap and hold for a second on the “Traffic Map” to find nearby gas stations ordered by price.\n   · Configure in settings how much you would like to deviate from your route to find cheap gas (cheap gas stations aren’t placed in main roads), a second gas type, and with how much zoom they are shown on the “Traffic Map”\n   · Create your gas station favourite list to check their prices easily\n\n- MORE:\n   · Choose the tab where the app is initiated according to what you use more: Warner, Traffic Map, or Routes.\n   · Warn your friends of problems in the road via WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, iMessage,…\n   · Traffic Alarms to remember checking the traffic and avoid traffic jams\n\n- The paid version (the “pro”) includes everything, it doesn’t have ads or in-app purchases. The free one has one in-app purchase which enables the automatic update of speed cams (the speed of speed cams is not shown on the Watch without this in-app purchase, although a general warning is given), removes the ads, and allows to chose dark/light mode independently of the iPhone settings. If you buy it, you would have the same functionality of the paid version.\n\nNOTES:\n\n- To use the Warner you need your device to have a GPS integrated: all iPhones have it, iPod and iPad WiFi do NOT have it (iPad 3G DOES have it). The rest of the functionality (routes, traffic, gas price) works in any device.\n\nATTENTION! The Speed Cam Warner uses your GPS. Continuos use of the warner in fore or background can drain your battery quickly."},"versionHistory":[{"versionDisplay":"15.0.2","releaseNotes":"- Improved gestures in the traffic camera viewer\n- Small fixes and improvements.\n\nIn previous versions:\n- Ready for iOS 14.\n- Improvements in the Watch app:\nWarnings with notifications when the app is in background (authorise it if you want to use this functionlity).\nInternal improvements to be able to bring new features in the future.\n- New image viewer for traffic cameras, swipe downwards to close.\n- When moving the map in the Warner manually, you can choose if the map is centered in your location inmediately, never, or after a configurable time.
