      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So far I haven’t had any problems with the app or watching what I’d like to. I can only say that I don’t like downloading movies or original series. I wish I could just watch or stream some of programming on EPIX. I love the all the choices I have, the original series are wonderful. I’m totally happy I have this app, I highly recommend it! ❤️❤️❤️❤️</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>After logging in with my DIRECTV account, I am only able to view an extremely limited number of EPIX series and no movies at all. The app constantly tells me that I’m “missing out” and that I need to subscribe, but it never provides a link or directions on how to do that. Even after logging in to my DIRECTV account on the EPIX website there are no directions or options to subscribe.<br />If I truly need to subscribe after logging in, then a method that’s easy to find and use should be available. If I don’t need to subscribe after logging in, then this app needs updating.<br /><br />2 stars for being able to view Pennyworth and Get Shorty, which seems to be the only things I can view at this time (among the shows and movies I’ve attempted to view).</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been experiencing major problems with playing downloads when I am not connected to a network. All videos will play but only has sound for first five seconds or so. After that it will continue to play but muted. It seems to be a problem when a video has been previously partially played. Only way I have going to fix issue is to delete all downloads and reinstall app. When it works it is a great app hence my three stars but when it doesn’t it is terrible. I can never trust epic to to be the app I can rely on for offline entertainment</p>

If we offer user registration on the Applications, to register as a member of the Applications, there may be a few options for you to register:  Application Registration (as described below) and Third Party Social Media Network Sign-On (as described below), if offered by the particular Application.  In each case, you are required to either use a pre-existing user name and password (together, your “User ID”) or select a new User ID.\n3.1.2.\tApplication Registration.  For Application registration, you are required to select a User ID and may be required to also provide other Information, such as your email address and date of birth.  Additional Information may be requested and/or required during the registration process.\n3.1.2.1.\tThird Party Social Media Network Sign-On.  We may provide you with the ability to sign on to the Applications by using third party social media network credentials (“SMN”).  If you choose to sign-in through an SMN, you may be required to provide us with all or some of the Information required in the Application’s registration form and your use of the Applications shall be governed by the applicable SMN’s privacy policy and user agreements as well as this Privacy Policy and the Application’s Terms of Use Agreement. Please note that the SMN may set additional or different requirements for membership than those set for the Applications, such as minimum age.  We, and Network, are not responsible for the use of any such SMN, or for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any information that you may disclose to or receive from an SMN or other third party in connection with such use.  If you use an SMN to sign-in, we may receive certain information from such SMN and our use of your Information we receive from any SMN is governed by the relevant policies of any such SMN and any permissions you give us regarding your Information, including, but not limited to, those set forth in this Privacy Policy.  If you have questions about whether a particular feature, function, or service of the Applications is powered by a third party, you may contact us with your question as provided in Section 12.2 (Questions) below.\n3.1.3.\tIn Connection with Certain Features and Functions.  We may also provide you with access to certain features or functions that we may offer on the Applications, such as the option to participate in commenting, shopping, and member profile pages.  To sign up for or participate in these features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions.  For example, if we offer e-Commerce services on an Application, if you order any of our goods or services through such services, in addition to your name and contact information, we (or our operational service providers that we use to provide the e-Commerce service) may also collect and/or maintain your billing address, shipping address, selections, credit card or other payment instrument information, order number, and information about your computer’s internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Applications.\nThe Applications may also provide features, functions, and/or services powered by an SMN or other third party.  For example, Information may be disclosed to an SMN through plug-ins offered by such SMN (such as Likes, Shares or commenting).  Please take care when using any SMN or other third party service and familiarize yourself with the SMN’s or other third party’s policies and agreements, if any, that govern such use.\n3.1.4.\tIn Connection with Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.  There may be a separate registration process to enter Promotions (as defined in the Application’s Terms of Use Agreement) such as contests and sweepstakes that may require the submission of all or some of the following:  your first and last name, street address, city, state, zip code, email address, telephone number, and date of birth.  Additional Information may be requested depending on the specific Promotion.  The Promotion’s entry page and/or Rules shall provide the specific requirements.  You may also have the opportunity to opt-in to receive special Promotions or offers from our third party advertisers, sponsors, or promotional partners (“Advertisers”) as a result of your use of the Applications in connection with these Promotions.\n3.2.\tInformation Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.\nThe Applications and/or third parties may use “cookies”, “web beacons”, Flash local shared objects and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect Other Information automatically as you browse and use the Applications and other websites, applications, or other interactive services.  “Cookies” are typically html or browser-based text or other files (and often referred to as browser cookies) that help store information, user preferences, and/or user activity.  “Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif, tracking pixels or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect data, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses.  Flash local shared objects (“LSOs”) (sometimes known as Flash cookies) are text or other files that help store user preferences and/or activity.\nThese Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Applications (such as your visits to the Application’s webpages or Application, type of browser used, device type and model, system language, Wi-Fi status, device motion parameters, carrier, type of operating system used, date and time of viewing, use of our features, and purchasing history or preferences) or other websites, applications, or interactive services.  Through these Tracking Technologies, we may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on these Applications and other websites, applications, or other interactive services and may also collect or access your IP address and/or set or access some other identifier unique to the Device(s), Device platform, and/or Device-Internet browser combination you use to access the Applications (“Identifier”).  For example, we may set a unique alphanumeric Identifier unique to your home computer on Firefox, or access an Identifier provided by a mobile platform, such as the application or advertising Identifiers offered by Apple.  Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may combine any or all of the Other Information we collect using Tracking Technologies and associate it and/or Identifiers with your Personal Information (such as your User ID) and/or with other non-personally identifiable unique identifiers assigned by Network or third parties.\n3.2.1.\tThe Applications’ Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information.  We may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you.   We use Tracking Technologies to enable us to collect and then use Information as described in Section 4.2 “Other Information Collected By Us” under “How Is Collected Information Used” below.  For example, we use Tracking Technologies to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times or seeing advertisements too frequently, to tailor your experience on the Applications by delivering relevant personalized advertising, email marketing, and other content, and to record if you have opted out of receiving personalized advertising from us.\n3.2.2.\tThird Parties’ Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information.  These Applications may also use third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or audience measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third parties (collectively, “Third Party Service Providers”) to, for example, facilitate personalized advertisements (“Customized Advertising”) and/or other content, serve advertisements on the Applications, assist in our marketing and advertising to other users or potential users, and/or measure and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on the Applications.  Customized Advertising enables us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you for products and services that you might be interested in based on your visits to the Applications and other websites, applications, or other interactive services you have visited.\nThird Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device subject to your choices about those Tracking Technologies (see “Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers” section below and “More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies” section below) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites, applications, and interactive services when you use the Applications.\nExcept to the extent necessary to provide services to the Applications, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Applications, but we may provide to Third Party Service Providers certain Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Applications in order for the Applications to provide Customized Advertising or in order for the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to the Applications, such as measuring or analyzing advertising or content effectiveness or traffic on the Applications.  For example, in order to analyze traffic on the Applications, we may provide to our Third Party Service Providers certain information we collect about your interaction with the Applications along with an Identifier so that the Third Party Service Provider may provide analytics services to the Applications.\n4.\tHow Collected Information Is Used.\nAs set forth in this Privacy Policy, we may share Information with Network and other third parties.\n4.1.\tPersonal Information.  Network may use the Personal Information we collect from you in a variety of ways, including:\n•\tSending marketing and promotional emails, newsletters or, subject to the “Text Messaging Marketing and Promotions” Section below, text messages offering goods and/or services that may be of interest to users, whether those goods and/or services are provided by the Applications, Network, or third parties (for example, we may send you an email about a product sold by a third party or about a new show);\n•\tProcessing your registration with the Applications, such as verifying that your email address is active and valid as an existing registered member of this Applications;\n•\tContacting you regarding the administration of your account, any services, features, or functions you have enrolled in or registered to use, any Promotions you have participated in or have entered, any goods and/or services you have ordered through e-Commerce services available on the Applications, or any other transactions you have undertaken with the Applications;\n•\tAllowing you to participate in the public areas and/or other features of the Applications;\n•\tResponding to your questions or other requests;\n•\tContacting you regarding your use of the Applications, for informational purposes related to the Applications, or, in our discretion, regarding changes to the Application’s policies;\n•\tImproving the Applications or our services and for internal business purposes;\n•\tTailoring your experience on, and/or otherwise customizing what you see when you visit, the Applications, and/or other sites, applications, or other interactive services across Devices, whether owned, operated, and/or provided by Network or by third parties (for example, to provide recommendations on content or provide advertisements, emails, or other content of more interest to you);\n•\tSaving your User ID or other Personal Information, so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Applications;\n•\tAssist in our marketing and advertising to other users or potential users;\n•\tOtherwise to maintain and administer the Applications; and\n•\tFor other purposes disclosed at the time you provide the Personal Information.\n4.2.\tOther Information Collected by Us.

The use of Tracking Technologies by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers is within their control and not ours.  Even if we have a relationship with the Third Party Service Provider or Advertiser, we do not control their websites, applications, or other interactive services or their policies and practices regarding your Information and you should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use, or disclosure of your Information by third parties in connection with their advertisements or promotions and other sites, applications, or other interactive services you encounter on the Internet.  This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Information that a Third Party Service Provider or Advertiser may directly collect from you.  Use of Third Party Service Providers’ and Advertisers’ Tracking Technologies is governed by the Third Party Service Providers’ or Advertisers’, as applicable, own specific privacy policies and not this Privacy Policy.  However, please see the “Your Choices” section for more information on how to opt-out of the collection and/or use of Information collected by certain Third Party Service Providers.\n5.\tYour Choices.\n5.1.\tOpting-Out of Certain Uses of Personal Information.\n5.1.1.\tIn Connection with Marketing and Promotional Emails and Offers.\nYou may “opt-out” of receiving marketing and promotional emails from us at any time by using the opt-out mechanism that is contained in each such email.  Please note that when you opt-out of receiving marketing and promotional emails from us, you are not opting out of receiving newsletters from us (please see Section 5.1.2 below for your newsletter options).\nPlease note that, if you deactivate your registration as a member of the Application, you shall continue to receive marketing and promotional emails from the Applications unless you subsequently exercise your opt-out options above.\n5.1.2.\tIn connection with Newsletters and other Editorial-based Emails.\nIf the Application offers newsletters or other editorial-based emails, you may opt out of receiving any such newsletter emails by using the opt-out mechanism contained in each such newsletter email.

However, even if you exercise your opt-out rights above, we, or Network, may continue to contact you for the other purposes described in the “How Is Collected Information Used” Section above, such as for maintenance and administrative purposes.\n5.2.\tYour Choices with Respect to Tracking Technologies.\n5.2.1.\tTracking Technologies Set By Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers.  Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers may collect Other Information about you when you visit an Application for Customized Advertising to help identify products and services that may interest you and deliver advertising and/or other content tailored to your interests and for the other uses described above.  Your opt-out options regarding these Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers are described below.\nFor more information about Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and your ability to opt-out of Advertising from such third parties, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Opt-Out Tool and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.  Please click on the links to these tools to learn more about your choices.  Please note that, if third party browser cookies are disabled (whether by you or automatically by the browser or Device) or you subsequently delete browser cookies, the opt-out choices you have exercised may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies or opt out again in order for your opt-out choices to function.\nYou may also prevent or exercise choices regarding the use of certain Tracking Technologies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls for the Internet browser as described in the “More Information About Cookie Controls” section below.  Please note that using those controls may affect Tracking Technologies that are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.\nSee the “More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies” section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and for information on your choices regarding Identifiers on mobile platforms.\n5.2.2.\tTracking Technologies Set By the Applications.  With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Applications, you can prevent or exercise choices regarding the use of certain Tracking Technologies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls in your Internet browser as described in the “More Information About Cookie Controls” section below.  Please note that using those controls may affect Tracking Technologies that are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.\nSee the “More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies” section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by the Applications and for information on your choices regarding Identifiers on mobile platforms.\nPlease note that if you exercise the opt-out above, that only applies to the use of the data for Customized Advertising and we may still use the data for other purposes described in Section 4.2 “How is Collected Information Used” above, such as for video playhead tracking and to optimize your video experience.\n5.2.3.\tMore Information on Managing Tracking Technologies.  With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Applications, Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, please note the following with respect to the above opt-out options:\n5.2.3.1.\tMore Information About Cookie Controls.  For the following Internet browsers, you may prevent or exercise choices regarding browser cookies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls described in the following:\n•\tInternet Explorer 11\n•\tChrome\n•\tSafari\n•\tFirefox\nIf your Internet browser is not listed above or you otherwise are having difficulties with the links, you may be able to access controls to:\n•\tDelete existing browser cookies through the “Internet Options”, “Settings”, Preferences”, “Options”, or similar menu selection in your browser’s menu or otherwise as directed by your browser’s support feature, which means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in the future.\n•\tDisable browser cookies through the same browser controls, which means that browser cookies shall not be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted.  Additional information on enabling or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser’s support feature.  (See the “help” section of your browser for more information.)  Disabling may sometimes be referred to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices.  \n•\tIf you delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.\n•\tChoose to have the Device you use to access the Applications warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set.  (You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.)  This may be available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Applications.  Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser’s support feature.\n•\tSeek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser’s support features.\nThe above options may cover browser cookies set by the Applications, browser cookies not set by the Applications (sometimes called third party cookies), and/or both types of browser cookies. \nMany tools discussed above are “Internet browser cookie based”.  This means that such tools rely on cookies to remember your choices.  For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser, after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to reestablish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms described above, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through these mechanisms again.\nThe tools are “Internet browser and Device-specific” or “Device-specific”.  Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices and platforms.  \n5.2.3.2.\tAutomatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs.  Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications, or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function.  For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.\n5.2.3.3.\tYou will still receive advertisements.  Deleting or disabling Third Party Service Providers’, Advertisers’ or the Applications’ Tracking Technologies does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads.  If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you will continue to see ads on the Applications and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Applications to set Tracking Technologies for frequency capping purposes as described in the “Information Collected Through the Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies” section.\n5.2.3.4.\tLimitations Regarding Web Beacons.  Web beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled Tracking Technologies to track your activities.\n5.2.3.5.\tHow to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies).  Control of Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies) Must Be Handled Separately. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER.  Deleting, rejecting, disabling, or turning off Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Applications through the above options shall not remove Flash LSOs.  For more information about Flash LSOs and how to remove them from your computer, please visit http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html.  If you remove Flash LSOs, you may not have access to certain features of the Applications and some of our other services may not function properly.\n5.2.3.6.\tOther Effects of Managing Tracking Technologies.  In addition to the above, if you delete or disable Tracking Technologies set by the Applications, the Applications may no longer be able to offer certain features or functionality to you, such as remembering your preferences, remembering your username, saving your player settings, or other purposes described in “Other Information Collected By Us” above, and some of our other services may not function properly.  In addition to the above, if you disable or delete Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers (or if such Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled on your Device or browser), the Applications may no longer be able to offer certain functionality to you, such as enabling SMN login or saving your player settings and certain services or advertisements may not work for such Devices or browsers.\n5.2.3.7.\tMobile Platforms.  Certain mobile platforms, such as Apple or Google, may offer users choice regarding the Identifiers we, Third Party Service Providers, or Advertisers may access and use, which may not be browser cookie based.  We encourage you to review and understand the choices that such mobile platforms may provide to you regarding these Identifiers.\n5.2.3.8.\tCertain Identifiers.  Certain Identifiers we set may not be deleted, blocked, or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such Identifiers rely on, or are associated with, browser cookies or other Tracking Technologies.\n6.\tText Messaging Marketing and Promotions.\nWe may share your Personal Information with the Third Party Service Providers that assist us in delivering Text Services and similar services to you and with Network and as otherwise provided in “Sharing and Disclosure of Information” below.\n7.\tSharing and Disclosure of Information.\n7.1.\tSharing and Disclosure of Personal Information.\nWe may disclose your Personal Information with Network and/or to third parties under the circumstances described below.\n7.1.1.\tDisclosure to Network.  We may disclose Personal Information to Network for marketing, administrative, and/or other purposes.  You can choose to opt-out of certain such uses as described in the “Opting-Out of Certain Uses of Personal Information” Section above.\n7.1.2.\tDisclosure of Certain Information in Postings Intended to Be Disclosed.  Certain Personal Information associated with a Posting may be intended for disclosure (“Posting Information”), such as username.  We shall disclose Posting Information in connection with the display of, and other services relating to, such Posting.\n7.1.3.\tDisclosure In Connection with Co-Branded Services and Features.  The Applications may also offer services and features, such as events and Promotions, that we put together with another company (“Co-Branded Partner”) and that may be hosted on the Applications and/or our Co-Branded Partner’s or a Promotion-specific website, application, or other interactive service.  The Co-Branded Partner shall be identified on the co-branded feature or service and we will notify you at the time your Personal Information is requested whether your Personal Information will be shared with such Co-Branded Partner and provide you with a link to the Co-Branded Partner’s privacy policy.  If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner’s future use of such Personal Information for marketing purposes, you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly and the use of such information by Co-Branded Partner is subject to Co-Branded Partner’s privacy policy.  Please note that your Information may be shared with Co-Branded Partners for purposes of administering or conducting the co-branded services and features (but not for marketing purposes) without a separate notification (for example, if the Co-Branded Partner is administering a Promotion you have entered, your Information may be shared with the Co-Branded Partner so that the Co-Branded Partner can verify your eligibility and/or contact you if you are a potential winner).\n7.1.4.\tDisclosure to Third Party Service Providers.  We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to Third Party Service Providers for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Application’s services, features, functions, and operations, for Application hosting, conducting usage analysis, sending e-mail or other communications, fulfilling orders, providing marketing and advertising tools and data analytics capabilities, including but not limited to Customized Advertising and to assist in our marketing and advertising to other users or potential users, clearing and processing credit card payments, distributing surveys and engaging in research, or performing other administrative services.\n7.1.5.\tDisclosure to Certain Other Third Parties.  In addition to the above, we make your Personal Information available to certain third parties in the following limited circumstances:\n•\tWhen we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court, or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process) or if requested by a governmental agency or other authority as part of an investigation;\n•\tIf we believe your actions violate any law, rule, regulation, and/or the Terms of Use Agreement, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy or Additional Terms;\n•\tIn connection with Promotions, as necessary to administer the Promotion or as required by applicable laws, rules, or regulations (for example, to provide winners’ lists or make required filings as appropriate);\n•\tIf you agree to have your Personal Information shared with or otherwise disclosed to a third party for marketing or other purposes, in which case the third party’s use of your Personal Information is subject to the third party’s own privacy policy;\n•\tIf, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate:  to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries; to protect our business and assets or the rights, property, or safety of the EPIX Service, Network, or any of its or their Third Party Service Providers, licensors, suppliers, Advertisers, customers, users, or any other party; to limit our legal liability; to defend our interests; to enforce this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use Agreement; and/or to comply with our legal, regulatory, audit, and compliance obligations or requests by law enforcement or other governmental authorities; and/or\n•\tIn the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, sale, transfer of control, joint venture, or other business combination involving us, or Network.\n7.2.\tSharing and Disclosure of Other Information.

To sign up for or participate in these features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions.  For example, if we offer e-Commerce services on an Application, if you order any of our goods or services through such services, in addition to your name and contact information, we (or our operational service providers that we use to provide the e-Commerce service) may also collect and/or maintain your billing address, shipping address, selections, credit card or other payment instrument information, order number, and information about your computer’s internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Applications.\nThe Applications may also provide features, functions, and/or services powered by an SMN or other third party.  For example, Information may be disclosed to an SMN through plug-ins offered by such SMN (such as Likes, Shares or commenting).  Please take care when using any SMN or other third party service and familiarize yourself with the SMN’s or other third party’s policies and agreements, if any, that govern such use.\n3.1.4.\tIn Connection with Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.  There may be a separate registration process to enter Promotions (as defined in the Application’s Terms of Use Agreement) such as contests and sweepstakes that may require the submission of all or some of the following:  your first and last name, street address, city, state, zip code, email address, telephone number, and date of birth.  Additional Information may be requested depending on the specific Promotion.  The Promotion’s entry page and/or Rules shall provide the specific requirements.  You may also have the opportunity to opt-in to receive special Promotions or offers from our third party advertisers, sponsors, or promotional partners (“Advertisers”) as a result of your use of the Applications in connection with these Promotions.\n3.2.\tInformation Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.\nThe Applications and/or third parties may use “cookies”, “web beacons”, Flash local shared objects and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect Other Information automatically as you browse and use the Applications and other websites, applications, or other interactive services.  “Cookies” are typically html or browser-based text or other files (and often referred to as browser cookies) that help store information, user preferences, and/or user activity.  “Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif, tracking pixels or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect data, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses.  Flash local shared objects (“LSOs”) (sometimes known as Flash cookies) are text or other files that help store user preferences and/or activity.\nThese Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Applications (such as your visits to the Application’s webpages or Application, type of browser used, device type and model, system language, Wi-Fi status, device motion parameters, carrier, type of operating system used, date and time of viewing, use of our features, and purchasing history or preferences) or other websites, applications, or interactive services.  Through these Tracking Technologies, we may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on these Applications and other websites, applications, or other interactive services and may also collect or access your IP address and/or set or access some other identifier unique to the Device(s), Device platform, and/or Device-Internet browser combination you use to access the Applications (“Identifier”).  For example, we may set a unique alphanumeric Identifier unique to your home computer on Firefox, or access an Identifier provided by a mobile platform, such as the application or advertising Identifiers offered by Apple.  Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may combine any or all of the Other Information we collect using Tracking Technologies and associate it and/or Identifiers with your Personal Information (such as your User ID) and/or with other non-personally identifiable unique identifiers assigned by Network or third parties.\n3.2.1.\tThe Applications’ Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information.  We may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you.   We use Tracking Technologies to enable us to collect and then use Information as described in Section 4.2 “Other Information Collected By Us” under “How Is Collected Information Used” below.  For example, we use Tracking Technologies to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times or seeing advertisements too frequently, to tailor your experience on the Applications by delivering relevant personalized advertising, email marketing, and other content, and to record if you have opted out of receiving personalized advertising from us.\n3.2.2.\tThird Parties’ Use of Tracking Technologies to Collect Information.  These Applications may also use third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or audience measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third parties (collectively, “Third Party Service Providers”) to, for example, facilitate personalized advertisements (“Customized Advertising”) and/or other content, serve advertisements on the Applications, assist in our marketing and advertising to other users or potential users, and/or measure and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on the Applications.  Customized Advertising enables us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you for products and services that you might be interested in based on your visits to the Applications and other websites, applications, or other interactive services you have visited.\nThird Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device subject to your choices about those Tracking Technologies (see “Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers” section below and “More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies” section below) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites, applications, and interactive services when you use the Applications.\nExcept to the extent necessary to provide services to the Applications, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Applications, but we may provide to Third Party Service Providers certain Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Applications in order for the Applications to provide Customized Advertising or in order for the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to the Applications, such as measuring or analyzing advertising or content effectiveness or traffic on the Applications.  For example, in order to analyze traffic on the Applications, we may provide to our Third Party Service Providers certain information we collect about your interaction with the Applications along with an Identifier so that the Third Party Service Provider may provide analytics services to the Applications.\n4.\tHow Collected Information Is Used.\nAs set forth in this Privacy Policy, we may share Information with Network and other third parties.\n4.1.\tPersonal Information.  Network may use the Personal Information we collect from you in a variety of ways, including:\n•\tSending marketing and promotional emails, newsletters or, subject to the “Text Messaging Marketing and Promotions” Section below, text messages offering goods and/or services that may be of interest to users, whether those goods and/or services are provided by the Applications, Network, or third parties (for example, we may send you an email about a product sold by a third party or about a new show);\n•\tProcessing your registration with the Applications, such as verifying that your email address is active and valid as an existing registered member of this Applications;\n•\tContacting you regarding the administration of your account, any services, features, or functions you have enrolled in or registered to use, any Promotions you have participated in or have entered, any goods and/or services you have ordered through e-Commerce services available on the Applications, or any other transactions you have undertaken with the Applications;\n•\tAllowing you to participate in the public areas and/or other features of the Applications;\n•\tResponding to your questions or other requests;\n•\tContacting you regarding your use of the Applications, for informational purposes related to the Applications, or, in our discretion, regarding changes to the Application’s policies;\n•\tImproving the Applications or our services and for internal business purposes;\n•\tTailoring your experience on, and/or otherwise customizing what you see when you visit, the Applications, and/or other sites, applications, or other interactive services across Devices, whether owned, operated, and/or provided by Network or by third parties (for example, to provide recommendations on content or provide advertisements, emails, or other content of more interest to you);\n•\tSaving your User ID or other Personal Information, so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Applications;\n•\tAssist in our marketing and advertising to other users or potential users;\n•\tOtherwise to maintain and administer the Applications; and\n•\tFor other purposes disclosed at the time you provide the Personal Information.\n4.2.\tOther Information Collected by Us.

The use of Tracking Technologies by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers is within their control and not ours.  Even if we have a relationship with the Third Party Service Provider or Advertiser, we do not control their websites, applications, or other interactive services or their policies and practices regarding your Information and you should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use, or disclosure of your Information by third parties in connection with their advertisements or promotions and other sites, applications, or other interactive services you encounter on the Internet.  This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Information that a Third Party Service Provider or Advertiser may directly collect from you.  Use of Third Party Service Providers’ and Advertisers’ Tracking Technologies is governed by the Third Party Service Providers’ or Advertisers’, as applicable, own specific privacy policies and not this Privacy Policy.  However, please see the “Your Choices” section for more information on how to opt-out of the collection and/or use of Information collected by certain Third Party Service Providers.\n5.\tYour Choices.\n5.1.\tOpting-Out of Certain Uses of Personal Information.\n5.1.1.\tIn Connection with Marketing and Promotional Emails and Offers.\nYou may “opt-out” of receiving marketing and promotional emails from us at any time by using the opt-out mechanism that is contained in each such email.  Please note that when you opt-out of receiving marketing and promotional emails from us, you are not opting out of receiving newsletters from us (please see Section 5.1.2 below for your newsletter options).\nPlease note that, if you deactivate your registration as a member of the Application, you shall continue to receive marketing and promotional emails from the Applications unless you subsequently exercise your opt-out options above.\n5.1.2.\tIn connection with Newsletters and other Editorial-based Emails.\nIf the Application offers newsletters or other editorial-based emails, you may opt out of receiving any such newsletter emails by using the opt-out mechanism contained in each such newsletter email.

However, even if you exercise your opt-out rights above, we, or Network, may continue to contact you for the other purposes described in the “How Is Collected Information Used” Section above, such as for maintenance and administrative purposes.\n5.2.\tYour Choices with Respect to Tracking Technologies.\n5.2.1.\tTracking Technologies Set By Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers.  Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers may collect Other Information about you when you visit an Application for Customized Advertising to help identify products and services that may interest you and deliver advertising and/or other content tailored to your interests and for the other uses described above.  Your opt-out options regarding these Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers are described below.\nFor more information about Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and your ability to opt-out of Advertising from such third parties, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Opt-Out Tool and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.  Please click on the links to these tools to learn more about your choices.  Please note that, if third party browser cookies are disabled (whether by you or automatically by the browser or Device) or you subsequently delete browser cookies, the opt-out choices you have exercised may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies or opt out again in order for your opt-out choices to function.\nYou may also prevent or exercise choices regarding the use of certain Tracking Technologies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls for the Internet browser as described in the “More Information About Cookie Controls” section below.  Please note that using those controls may affect Tracking Technologies that are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.\nSee the “More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies” section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and for information on your choices regarding Identifiers on mobile platforms.\n5.2.2.\tTracking Technologies Set By the Applications.  With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Applications, you can prevent or exercise choices regarding the use of certain Tracking Technologies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls in your Internet browser as described in the “More Information About Cookie Controls” section below.  Please note that using those controls may affect Tracking Technologies that are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.\nSee the “More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies” section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by the Applications and for information on your choices regarding Identifiers on mobile platforms.\nPlease note that if you exercise the opt-out above, that only applies to the use of the data for Customized Advertising and we may still use the data for other purposes described in Section 4.2 “How is Collected Information Used” above, such as for video playhead tracking and to optimize your video experience.\n5.2.3.\tMore Information on Managing Tracking Technologies.  With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Applications, Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, please note the following with respect to the above opt-out options:\n5.2.3.1.\tMore Information About Cookie Controls.  For the following Internet browsers, you may prevent or exercise choices regarding browser cookies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls described in the following:\n•\tInternet Explorer 11\n•\tChrome\n•\tSafari\n•\tFirefox\nIf your Internet browser is not listed above or you otherwise are having difficulties with the links, you may be able to access controls to:\n•\tDelete existing browser cookies through the “Internet Options”, “Settings”, Preferences”, “Options”, or similar menu selection in your browser’s menu or otherwise as directed by your browser’s support feature, which means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in the future.\n•\tDisable browser cookies through the same browser controls, which means that browser cookies shall not be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted.  Additional information on enabling or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser’s support feature.  (See the “help” section of your browser for more information.)  Disabling may sometimes be referred to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices.  \n•\tIf you delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.\n•\tChoose to have the Device you use to access the Applications warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set.  (You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.)  This may be available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Applications.  Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser’s support feature.\n•\tSeek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser’s support features.\nThe above options may cover browser cookies set by the Applications, browser cookies not set by the Applications (sometimes called third party cookies), and/or both types of browser cookies. \nMany tools discussed above are “Internet browser cookie based”.  This means that such tools rely on cookies to remember your choices.  For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser, after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to reestablish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms described above, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through these mechanisms again.\nThe tools are “Internet browser and Device-specific” or “Device-specific”.  Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices and platforms.  \n5.2.3.2.\tAutomatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs.  Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications, or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function.  For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.\n5.2.3.3.\tYou will still receive advertisements.  Deleting or disabling Third Party Service Providers’, Advertisers’ or the Applications’ Tracking Technologies does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads.  If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you will continue to see ads on the Applications and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Applications to set Tracking Technologies for frequency capping purposes as described in the “Information Collected Through the Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies” section.\n5.2.3.4.\tLimitations Regarding Web Beacons.  Web beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled Tracking Technologies to track your activities.\n5.2.3.5.\tHow to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies).  Control of Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies) Must Be Handled Separately. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER.  Deleting, rejecting, disabling, or turning off Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Applications through the above options shall not remove Flash LSOs.  For more information about Flash LSOs and how to remove them from your computer, please visit http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html.  If you remove Flash LSOs, you may not have access to certain features of the Applications and some of our other services may not function properly.\n5.2.3.6.\tOther Effects of Managing Tracking Technologies.  In addition to the above, if you delete or disable Tracking Technologies set by the Applications, the Applications may no longer be able to offer certain features or functionality to you, such as remembering your preferences, remembering your username, saving your player settings, or other purposes described in “Other Information Collected By Us” above, and some of our other services may not function properly.  In addition to the above, if you disable or delete Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers (or if such Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled on your Device or browser), the Applications may no longer be able to offer certain functionality to you, such as enabling SMN login or saving your player settings and certain services or advertisements may not work for such Devices or browsers.\n5.2.3.7.\tMobile Platforms.  Certain mobile platforms, such as Apple or Google, may offer users choice regarding the Identifiers we, Third Party Service Providers, or Advertisers may access and use, which may not be browser cookie based.  We encourage you to review and understand the choices that such mobile platforms may provide to you regarding these Identifiers.\n5.2.3.8.\tCertain Identifiers.  Certain Identifiers we set may not be deleted, blocked, or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such Identifiers rely on, or are associated with, browser cookies or other Tracking Technologies.\n6.\tText Messaging Marketing and Promotions.\nWe may share your Personal Information with the Third Party Service Providers that assist us in delivering Text Services and similar services to you and with Network and as otherwise provided in “Sharing and Disclosure of Information” below.\n7.\tSharing and Disclosure of Information.\n7.1.\tSharing and Disclosure of Personal Information.\nWe may disclose your Personal Information with Network and/or to third parties under the circumstances described below.\n7.1.1.\tDisclosure to Network.  We may disclose Personal Information to Network for marketing, administrative, and/or other purposes.

Certain Personal Information associated with a Posting may be intended for disclosure (“Posting Information”), such as username.  We shall disclose Posting Information in connection with the display of, and other services relating to, such Posting.\n7.1.3.\tDisclosure In Connection with Co-Branded Services and Features.  The Applications may also offer services and features, such as events and Promotions, that we put together with another company (“Co-Branded Partner”) and that may be hosted on the Applications and/or our Co-Branded Partner’s or a Promotion-specific website, application, or other interactive service.  The Co-Branded Partner shall be identified on the co-branded feature or service and we will notify you at the time your Personal Information is requested whether your Personal Information will be shared with such Co-Branded Partner and provide you with a link to the Co-Branded Partner’s privacy policy.  If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner’s future use of such Personal Information for marketing purposes, you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly and the use of such information by Co-Branded Partner is subject to Co-Branded Partner’s privacy policy.  Please note that your Information may be shared with Co-Branded Partners for purposes of administering or conducting the co-branded services and features (but not for marketing purposes) without a separate notification (for example, if the Co-Branded Partner is administering a Promotion you have entered, your Information may be shared with the Co-Branded Partner so that the Co-Branded Partner can verify your eligibility and/or contact you if you are a potential winner).\n7.1.4.\tDisclosure to Third Party Service Providers.  We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to Third Party Service Providers for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Application’s services, features, functions, and operations, for Application hosting, conducting usage analysis, sending e-mail or other communications, fulfilling orders, providing marketing and advertising tools and data analytics capabilities, including but not limited to Customized Advertising and to assist in our marketing and advertising to other users or potential users, clearing and processing credit card payments, distributing surveys and engaging in research, or performing other administrative services.\n7.1.5.\tDisclosure to Certain Other Third Parties.  In addition to the above, we make your Personal Information available to certain third parties in the following limited circumstances:\n•\tWhen we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court, or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process) or if requested by a governmental agency or other authority as part of an investigation;\n•\tIf we believe your actions violate any law, rule, regulation, and/or the Terms of Use Agreement, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy or Additional Terms;\n•\tIn connection with Promotions, as necessary to administer the Promotion or as required by applicable laws, rules, or regulations (for example, to provide winners’ lists or make required filings as appropriate);\n•\tIf you agree to have your Personal Information shared with or otherwise disclosed to a third party for marketing or other purposes, in which case the third party’s use of your Personal Information is subject to the third party’s own privacy policy;\n•\tIf, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate:  to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries; to protect our business and assets or the rights, property, or safety of the EPIX Service, Network, or any of its or their Third Party Service Providers, licensors, suppliers, Advertisers, customers, users, or any other party; to limit our legal liability; to defend our interests; to enforce this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use Agreement; and/or to comply with our legal, regulatory, audit, and compliance obligations or requests by law enforcement or other governmental authorities; and/or\n•\tIn the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, sale, transfer of control, joint venture, or other business combination involving us, or Network.\n7.2.\tSharing and Disclosure of Other Information.
