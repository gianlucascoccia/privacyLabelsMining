      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Thank you so much for the update. I’ve sent you several reviews since I first downloaded this app, but I just keep getting more and more ideas, and I thought you ought to here them. First things first, I LOVE the update and it’s just what I imagined when I wrote my last review suggesting it. The horses are perfect! And the fact that you can ride them makes it even better. The new skins and character customization is on point! It’s perfect and I think this is one of the best updates I have witnessed so far! Secondly, I would love to be able to visit my sisters house in her single player world, because you can actually build in the single player, instead of the multiplayer. I’ve requested the several times, I think you should be Be able to build in the multiplayer servers, or be able to invite your friends into your single player, or maybe have a private server for just you and your friends! It would be much apretiated if you put my ideas into thaught.  That’s all for now, but I’m sure I will send another review your way soon with more ideas that could make your game even better, even though considering that it’s free, it’s hard to make it better then it already is, goodbye.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Yup, the game where the only updates are in multiplayer and single player. NONE in host server. Besides u can’t even craft cherry planks in work bench.i suggest 2 mak paintings resizable. And bluestone is SOO limited. U can’t even make a door with a button on the block next 2 it open da door. U can make bluestone travel thru a block. So there is a lever on one side on the other is a mechanism that gives u a waterfall. That wud be great! Add some dispensers or hoppers. Dat wud be good 2. And make lava and water somewhat place able. I mean, ur gonna be lucky if u place ONE lava or water bucket down. Wuts da point of tnt if it does nothing it multiplayer??? Mak it so that tnt only explodes in UNPROTECTED areas. Commands, they r great but not best. Add commands like: /killall or /grantall or /seeinv (use seeinv to edit and see others inventory). Mobs. Once u have iron armour mobs can’t even damage u. Add more mobs and make em’ more aggressive. Skins. Wouldn’t it be great if u cud custom skins! Add a skin area 2 mak ur own skin. Also maybe the name ‘Player’ wud be a bit annoying in some cases. It’d be great if u cud change it. In the new update I can’t sit on sofa or even SLEEP ON A BED!!! Ya, u betta fix dat. Adding shields and fixing n’ fishing rods wud be good 2! Ok, so all da things I told u r best fixed or added ASAP. Bye, lik ur game!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So I luvvvv da game but pls add:nether,hoppers,and dispenser and the trees when I break them there is and extra in the ground and it kinda bothers me also make da paintings resizable and different! Also pls pls pls add leads I am wondering how to tether my horse to a fence and mak new villigers kinda like Minecraft... also make it so animals and villigers can get into minecarts and remove the NPC’s make another game/section for skins so we can actually make our own and if you add new villigers make it so they can go into boats with you. If you haven’t done this (idk i hav not tried it) make it so other people can go on boats with you make when in survival or creative to have a place when you look at your character in your inventory have a place to put something else in your hand. Lastly when you place something on a slab it annoys me that it floats same with micro-slabs so plssssss do dat. I will probably keep editing this message but anyway thats it ...... for now!<br /><br />If you are uncomfortable with any of these requests don’t add them I don’t want anyone not happy because it is my opinion so anyway thanks have a nice one!</p>

you so much for the update. I’ve sent you several reviews since I first downloaded this app, but I just keep getting more and more ideas, and I thought you ought to here them. First things first, I LOVE the update and it’s just what I imagined when I wrote my last review suggesting it. The horses are perfect! And the fact that you can ride them makes it even better. The new skins and character customization is on point! It’s perfect and I think this is one of the best updates I have witnessed so far! Secondly, I would love to be able to visit my sisters house in her single player world, because you can actually build in the single player, instead of the multiplayer. I’ve requested the several times, I think you should be Be able to build in the multiplayer servers, or be able to invite your friends into your single player, or maybe have a private server for just you and your friends! It would be much apretiated if you put my ideas into thaught.  That’s all for now, but I’m sure I will send another review your way soon with more ideas that could make your game even better, even though considering that it’s free, it’s hard to make it better then it already is, goodbye.","title":"Thank you for the update!

NONE in host server. Besides u can’t even craft cherry planks in work bench.i suggest 2 mak paintings resizable. And bluestone is SOO limited. U can’t even make a door with a button on the block next 2 it open da door. U can make bluestone travel thru a block. So there is a lever on one side on the other is a mechanism that gives u a waterfall. That wud be great! Add some dispensers or hoppers. Dat wud be good 2. And make lava and water somewhat place able. I mean, ur gonna be lucky if u place ONE lava or water bucket down. Wuts da point of tnt if it does nothing it multiplayer??? Mak it so that tnt only explodes in UNPROTECTED areas. Commands, they r great but not best. Add commands like: /killall or /grantall or /seeinv (use seeinv to edit and see others inventory). Mobs. Once u have iron armour mobs can’t even damage u. Add more mobs and make em’ more aggressive. Skins. Wouldn’t it be great if u cud custom skins! Add a skin area 2 mak ur own skin. Also maybe the name ‘Player’ wud be a bit annoying in some cases. It’d be great if u cud change it. In the new update I can’t sit on sofa or even SLEEP ON A BED!!! Ya, u betta fix dat. Adding shields and fixing n’ fishing rods wud be good 2! Ok, so all da things I told u r best fixed or added ASAP.

If you haven’t done this (idk i hav not tried it) make it so other people can go on boats with you make when in survival or creative to have a place when you look at your character in your inventory have a place to put something else in your hand.

That would be it for my suggestions, your game is a very good game and you it’s the only game that lets me have no limits, thank you for what you do, if you put at least one of my suggestions in the game I would love that, thank you. 5/5 stars.","title":"It is a really good game","userName":"Infinite-E"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5854684440","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-23T22:47:07Z","rating":5,"review":"But there are a few minor problems 1. There are no host privileges or cheat codes. 2. There is no way to fly mode in Survival mode. 3. There aren’t that many mobs to do battle with. 4. The bow and fishing pole do not really work, 5. There no shields or maps or even totems. 6. The spiders are too small or too big and really hard to hit sometimes because their too fast not to mention their poisonous bite can be distracting and way too lethal and they attack without provocation. 7. There are no horses or saddles you can’t ride anything. 8. Mine carts and boats are impossible to steer or control. 9. You can’t breed animals or tame them. 10. There are no manuals or tutorials to teach you how to play. 11. The seeds for the worlds are too vague the worlds don’t seem to have proper zoning and not enough bioms. In closing I would like to say that the game has a lot of untapped potential but for a Minecraft like game don’t you think it should be more like Minecraft. The game could use a facelift but all in all an impressive start.","title":"Great game","userName":"CaptBanker2020"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5916695698","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-05-07T23:28:54Z","rating":4,"review":"Hey! This is a great game I love that there are actual name tags for naming animals, lots of blocks to choose from, and lots more! But I think it needs more animals. I would really LOVE if you added actual dogs in the game! (Preferably whippets, bloodhounds, and really just random mixed breeds)not just a tamed wolf. And horses and donkeys that you can ride would be awesome!! And maybe some animal accessories? ( dog food bowls so you don’t have to hand feed them and collars for dogs and cats)Oh, and being able to level up your pet wolf with talents would be sooo awesome!! A few more thing: leads! It can be hard to lure your pet into your house so can you put leads in please? I noticed my wolf can’t go into a single block door or fence gate or something like that. Could you make them be able to go through a single block space? Last thing! The  wolves will fall behind when they’re following you so maybe you could level them up to be fast or they could teleport to you! That all, thanks for making this game!

And, I know this might be a lot, but can you please add the Nether? I made a Nether portal and tried to light it with flint and steel and nothing happened. Which is kinda dumb. It would be nice if endermen were added because then we would have ender pearls and could teleport around. Also please add running if it isn't in the game already (I never checked) and add some more biomes. Please update the jungle also. It looks weird.
