      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hello! This is my first time writing a review for an app. I go WAY back with this app, and I’m so glad that it hasn’t changed to a paid app, and that it has been improved on since i used it probably over 6 years ago. Our old iPad got super laggy, and i haven’t played it since. I decided to download it again today so that I could draw a little fanart idea i had. I am so happy that the app has only improved, while still having the same purpose. I still remember when i had ads covering the content of the app (at the top of the screen where i was then unable to draw, and covering the tools at the bottom), and when i would download my drawing and have it come out annoyingly zoomed in.  I also love how they kept all the original stencils, stickers, and background options. I have had a lot of fun memories with this app!!! It makes me feel :). I also am very glad that there are now instructions to the games that i thought were just weird backgrounds, lol. I only have a couple of things that i believe could be added. My memories are hazy, but i for sure remember a color picking tool, and possibly a bucket fill tool. Whether they existed back then or not (i swear they did) then please add those features in :). I also wish i could be able to zoom in on my drawing to fill in small areas. I love this app and even now it’s super fun. Everything in this app i used to complain about is gone. I hope you see this, and thank you for all the fun!!!! :)</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi PenguinTheBob,<br />Yep we read every word of your thoughtful review.  Thank you so much!  We did move the color picker, but it still works the same way.  It&#39;s the second icon from the right on the bottom of the screen.  As for zoom and fill features--those are excellent ideas!  Your request for them just moved them up in our priority list.  So thank you.  Enjoy!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have had this app for about 7 years now, and have used it a lot for small thumbnails and pictures, or just to mess around a bit. And after a while, it got kind of boring and other apps were getting better and better, leaving this app in the dark. But, surprisingly, after 6 years, they updated it! Lots of new stuff, bug fixes, and small, but helpful features. And if you’re looking to buy this app: you should. It gets the Job done, has all the necessary tools needed for some simple art and picture editing, and for a FREE app it’s a really good one.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>My nephew has played with this app for years and now my toddler son. The latest update(s) however have made it harder and not nearly as enjoyable for the little one. The stamps used to just pop on the screen and now they have the hand adjustment symbols around them which is slightly distracting for the little guy. I’ve also noticed that several of the stamp sounds are inaccurate (for example: the baseball stamp sounds like a playground ball bouncing 🙄 and many of the animals sound the same or are not a typical sound that you would associate with that animal...I mean why doesn’t the tiger growl, and why does the orange sound like an unknown animal and the banana sounds like a goat 🐐. And the lobster sounds like someone is blowing up a balloon. These are just a few that are frustrating me, but I’m sure you will find plenty more inaccuracies that could be corrected. Please fix...The future of our youth depends on you! This app has been a handheld version of a “see &amp; say” for many kids and they will now be horribly confused.</p>

This is my first time writing a review for an app. I go WAY back with this app, and I’m so glad that it hasn’t changed to a paid app, and that it has been improved on since i used it probably over 6 years ago. Our old iPad got super laggy, and i haven’t played it since. I decided to download it again today so that I could draw a little fanart idea i had. I am so happy that the app has only improved, while still having the same purpose. I still remember when i had ads covering the content of the app (at the top of the screen where i was then unable to draw, and covering the tools at the bottom), and when i would download my drawing and have it come out annoyingly zoomed in.  I also love how they kept all the original stencils, stickers, and background options. I have had a lot of fun memories with this app!!! It makes me feel :). I also am very glad that there are now instructions to the games that i thought were just weird backgrounds, lol. I only have a couple of things that i believe could be added. My memories are hazy, but i for sure remember a color picking tool, and possibly a bucket fill tool. Whether they existed back then or not (i swear they did) then please add those features in :). I also wish i could be able to zoom in on my drawing to fill in small areas. I love this app and even now it’s super fun. Everything in this app i used to complain about is gone.

The latest update(s) however have made it harder and not nearly as enjoyable for the little one. The stamps used to just pop on the screen and now they have the hand adjustment symbols around them which is slightly distracting for the little guy. I’ve also noticed that several of the stamp sounds are inaccurate (for example: the baseball stamp sounds like a playground ball bouncing 🙄 and many of the animals sound the same or are not a typical sound that you would associate with that animal...I mean why doesn’t the tiger growl, and why does the orange sound like an unknown animal and the banana sounds like a goat 🐐. And the lobster sounds like someone is blowing up a balloon. These are just a few that are frustrating me, but I’m sure you will find plenty more inaccuracies that could be corrected.

My girl love this app, and I love that it gives them the opportunity to draw and such while out and about, without the mess. My youngest is very happy with the newest sticker additions as well as some other newer features, but my oldest was saddened to find that some of the stickers she once liked, are now gone, and it also seems that the amount has lessened.\nOverall, I say that, despite the annoying ads which redirect children away from the app, it is a fairly decent app for kids. My rating reflects this view.","title":"What happened to all of the stamps?","userName":"7_rayne_7"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3825957276","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-02-28T23:39:58Z","rating":5,"review":"Hey I want to you know if I have to start till noon or tomorrow I have some two days to go get my stuff for Christmas t p I tr I have to go home right after the day t the email address r I can just send them to you r I don’t know r the email I was sent in r to be eor right next time to you see ya iey e to me know when you get parked in the snow and I’ll let you in my room thanks so much merry merry good merry merry Christmas one merry new merry merry Christmas and merry merry happy merry wtetw","title":"I think we have some time for this week and we will was","userName":"gufot"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3641323750","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-01-12T12:58:53Z","rating":5,"review":"I’ve been using Doodle Buddy to write captions on pictures for a long time.
