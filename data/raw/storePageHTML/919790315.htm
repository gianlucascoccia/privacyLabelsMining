      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Okay so imma just say right now I’m not a bot and this is a genuine review 😭 So I had shudder for a bit, I tried out the free trial but couldn’t afford to upkeep my account. I accidentally forgot to cancel my subscription and they automatically charged my account $60 something, which was my fault. I emailed them about it and asked if I could get a refund quickly because I do have other payments that need to be taken care of. They got it done within 3 days and 2 update emails on them being under review to make sure I knew what was going on. Not only that they got my money back within a day of saying my claim was confirmed AND they cancelled my account for me. Other businesses take forever to process refunds or complaints, but they were snappy!!<br /><br />On top of that the selections were great on their app, they had the old school and new school horror and thriller movies. I loved that they have all three original versions of “The Ring” in Japanese with subtitles! That was great seeing the original, it’s been a while since I’ve had an app this good ❤️</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>There are a few good movies but nothing major. This app is a list of old and foreign films with a few Redbox movies thrown in for fun. When you write a review and it’s not stellar, the review doesn’t show up on the reviews. There are a few gems, yet they are b flicks and very few and far between. Most of the time you watch a movie just to be disappointed. The service works well. Unless  you can speak 10 languages or want to read for an hour skip it. I paid for a year so I guess I’m in it. I may cancel soon and they can keep the money. Who knows? Better to just rent a few from companies that don’t cut review or skimp on movies. I looked forward to this app. Now I’m just kicking myself for this decision. I’m writing this because I can’t find a single movie to watch after having shutter for a month. One full month and now I have an app that is as useful as a trampoline in outer space. The scary part of shutter is that I signed up for a year. That’s the first scary thing I have experienced with this app. No name movies most of which have been around longer than my 17 year old daughter. Why can this company not listen to horror fans? This app was made for hipsters and loners who don’t know quality. This is sad because the idea is epic but the execution was lack luster to say the least. There are very few movies on the app and very few worth while titles.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The only thing better than shudder is virtual reality horror. This app and what the devs did is truly an awesome accomplishment. If you are a horror freak like me, you don’t want Shudder, you NEED shudder!! I just watched a shudder exclusive called Haunt and the sub is already paying for itself! Shudder gives you all horror movies from not only the past but present. Also they give you international horror movies which is a must have for the horror enthusiast. Shudder seems to be growing and evolving at a nice pace. So far I haven’t gotten bored with any of the movies or series and the apps presentation is dam near perfect. I do wish I could review movies on my t.v. The streaming is extremely fast and I absolutely love the graphics that they made within the app, like the links that move like there’s an evil presence. I do wish they would incorporate different backgrounds maybe even live or moving backgrounds within the app which would rock! Thanks devs for an awesome horror experience and please give us more shudder exclusives like Haunt!!</p>

I accidentally forgot to cancel my subscription and they automatically charged my account $60 something, which was my fault. I emailed them about it and asked if I could get a refund quickly because I do have other payments that need to be taken care of. They got it done within 3 days and 2 update emails on them being under review to make sure I knew what was going on. Not only that they got my money back within a day of saying my claim was confirmed AND they cancelled my account for me. Other businesses take forever to process refunds or complaints, but they were snappy!!\n\nOn top of that the selections were great on their app, they had the old school and new school horror and thriller movies.

This app is a list of old and foreign films with a few Redbox movies thrown in for fun. When you write a review and it’s not stellar, the review doesn’t show up on the reviews. There are a few gems, yet they are b flicks and very few and far between. Most of the time you watch a movie just to be disappointed. The service works well. Unless  you can speak 10 languages or want to read for an hour skip it. I paid for a year so I guess I’m in it. I may cancel soon and they can keep the money. Who knows? Better to just rent a few from companies that don’t cut review or skimp on movies. I looked forward to this app. Now I’m just kicking myself for this decision. I’m writing this because I can’t find a single movie to watch after having shutter for a month. One full month and now I have an app that is as useful as a trampoline in outer space. The scary part of shutter is that I signed up for a year. That’s the first scary thing I have experienced with this app. No name movies most of which have been around longer than my 17 year old daughter. Why can this company not listen to horror fans? This app was made for hipsters and loners who don’t know quality. This is sad because the idea is epic but the execution was lack luster to say the least.

This app and what the devs did is truly an awesome accomplishment. If you are a horror freak like me, you don’t want Shudder, you NEED shudder!! I just watched a shudder exclusive called Haunt and the sub is already paying for itself! Shudder gives you all horror movies from not only the past but present. Also they give you international horror movies which is a must have for the horror enthusiast. Shudder seems to be growing and evolving at a nice pace. So far I haven’t gotten bored with any of the movies or series and the apps presentation is dam near perfect. I do wish I could review movies on my t.v. The streaming is extremely fast and I absolutely love the graphics that they made within the app, like the links that move like there’s an evil presence.

Shudder definitely knows their stuff. Major bonus points for the Joe Bib Briggs marathon. Whoever’s decision that was needs a raise!\n\nMy middling rating is only because I think Shudder still has room to grow, especially the design and layout of the platform. Limiting the ability to search only by title rather than other keywords like actor or director, especially with genre films like horror and thriller, is pretty annoying. It would be really nice and convenient to be able to isolate Shudder’s selection of Argento or Cronenberg films, for instance, or see which films feature Brigitte Lahaie. Also when searching through genres, it seems like the movies are always in reverse chronological order, which makes sense, but is also kind of frustrating while trying to brush up on the classics. Lastly, and I realize this is probably a licensing issue, but it’s kind of weird that there are various entries from certain series while omitting crucial chunks from those series (Phantasm without part 2, Halloween without parts 2 \u0026 3). \n\nOverall, been having a lot of fun with this app, but would look forward to some adjustments.","title":"Almost great","userName":"gimme_soper"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4105752041","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-05-05T19:09:56Z","rating":4,"review":"I love shudder and what it offers for people like myself who are into the horror genre, and the price for a year is unbeatable. So as a concept for streaming options it is a solid 5 stars.\n\nHowever, the app itself is problematic for several reasons. The search options are not as widespread as major streaming services like Netflix offer. The app has a tendency to shut off suddenly or crash that I do not notice with other streaming apps. It will not save your spot in a show or movie unless you manually exit out of the video to the main screen first, which is not true of netflix. The phone app also doesn’t sync with bluetooth headphones well so I cannot pause and play like I can with anything else in my phone. The phone app does do a good job of showing you the ratings of the movie and details with suggested titles but the xbox app lacks this ability and is limited in presentation overall. \n\nSo great streaming service but the apps have a long way to go.

I noticed it a week later, and tried to cancel and open a dispute. Instead of answering my ticket they just closed it out and told me there was no problem. I have tried over and over and over to cancel my membership, but it keeps saying that it’s still active. When I contacted the company they didn’t even seem concerned at all that I have been wrongfully charged, and that I couldn’t cancel my subscription. They just kept telling me that I can’t just delete the app to cancel, which I didn’t. I’m not an idiot. I even provided a screenshot of the confirmation. The company is awful, and completely incompetent. I dug through the reviews and saw this has happened to a few others. I was able to dispute the charge with my bank, and get a stop payment.

The only things holding it back are that a lot of the titles added get removed very quickly - a good number of them will get added for only a month or less. The titles often get removed without warning, and it would be nice to know when and which titles are leaving so I would have a chance to watch them. There is sometimes a “Last Chance to Watch” category, however this sometimes is there and sometimes isn’t, and it also doesn’t say when the films are leaving/how long you have to watch them till they’re gone. \nThose gripes aside, I still love the service and it has made a wide variety of films accessible.

I finally sent them an email telling them how upset I was about the whole situation and how my bank is disputing with them, and they replied two days later only asking to cancel the dispute and they’ll refund the money. They didn’t bring anything else up; it seems like they were only worried about the dispute with my bank and not the issues I’d been having.
