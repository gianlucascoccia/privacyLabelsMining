Yeah you! Shouldn't you be looking for Camera+ 2 instead? Our newest app has been rebuilt from the ground app to support the next 10 years (or 20, who knows?) of mobile photography. Check it out at http://camera.plus \n\nOver 10 million sold!\n\n“The Clarity filter is iPhone photography’s secret sauce—it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.”\n— Kevin Sintumuang, The Wall Street Journal\n\n“If the iPhone’s standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens.”\n— TIME: 50 Best iPhone Apps 2011\n\n“improves on almost every aspect of the built-in camera app”\n— Charlie Sorrel, Wired\n\nWinner: Best Visual Design, Best Photography App\n— Best App Ever Awards\n\n\nIt’s all about one thing... great photos!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned photographer or someone who’s barely touched a camera, Camera+ will make you love taking photos.\n\nTouch Exposure &amp; Focus\nSet exposure separately from focus. You can now easily control how light or dark your shots come out.\n\nShooting Modes\nUse the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.\n\nDigital Zoom\nUp to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.\n\nFront Flash\nHow many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!\n\nHorizon Level\nUse the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.\n\nClarity\nClarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.\n\nScene Modes\nMost modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.\n\nEffects\nProfessional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.\n\nLightbox\nAll the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots. You save only the photos you’re satisfied with so that your camera roll stays neat and clean.\n\nSharing\nWhether you want to show your results to your friends and family or the whole world, Camera+ has got you covered. Proudly share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Or go the more personal route and email or message them from right within the app.\n\niCloud Lightbox sync\nAutomatically sync your Camera+ photos between all of your devices. Shoot all day on your iPhone… and then edit at night on your iPad. \n\nCrops\nIf you didn’t line-up your shot perfectly when you took it, you can easily fix that with Camera+.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hey you! Yeah you! Shouldn&#39;t you be looking for Camera+ 2 instead? Our newest app has been rebuilt from the ground app to support the next 10 years (or 20, who knows?) of mobile photography. Check it out at http://camera.plus <br /><br />Over 10 million sold!<br /><br />“The Clarity filter is iPhone photography’s secret sauce—it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.”<br />— Kevin Sintumuang, The Wall Street Journal<br /><br />“If the iPhone’s standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens.”<br />— TIME: 50 Best iPhone Apps 2011<br /><br />“improves on almost every aspect of the built-in camera app”<br />— Charlie Sorrel, Wired<br /><br />Winner: Best Visual Design, Best Photography App<br />— Best App Ever Awards<br /><br /><br />It’s all about one thing... great photos!<br /><br />Whether you’re a seasoned photographer or someone who’s barely touched a camera, Camera+ will make you love taking photos.<br /><br />Touch Exposure &amp; Focus<br />Set exposure separately from focus. You can now easily control how light or dark your shots come out.<br /><br />Shooting Modes<br />Use the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.<br /><br />Digital Zoom<br />Up to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.<br /><br />Front Flash<br />How many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!<br /><br />Horizon Level<br />Use the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.<br /><br />Clarity<br />Clarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.<br /><br />Scene Modes<br />Most modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.<br /><br />Effects<br />Professional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.<br /><br />Lightbox<br />All the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots. You save only the photos you’re satisfied with so that your camera roll stays neat and clean.<br /><br />Sharing<br />Whether you want to show your results to your friends and family or the whole world, Camera+ has got you covered. Proudly share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Or go the more personal route and email or message them from right within the app.<br /><br />iCloud Lightbox sync<br />Automatically sync your Camera+ photos between all of your devices. Shoot all day on your iPhone… and then edit at night on your iPad. <br /><br />Crops<br />If you didn’t line-up your shot perfectly when you took it, you can easily fix that with Camera+. And when you want to get a bit creative, we setup a bunch of popular crop sizes for you. With a single tap, you can make your pics square, 4×6, 8×10, and more.<br /><br />Borders<br />With Camera+ you get several great border designs, from simple black and white borders to more gritty designs, you’ll be able to add wonderful finishing touches.<br /><br />Captions<br />Have some fun with your photos by putting captions on them. It’s a great way to really personalize your favorite shots.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I&#39;ve been using Camera+ for a while now, and the only reason that I am giving it four out of five stars is because of its RAW support. The fact that this app lets you shoot in RAW and TIFF is awesome. As someone who takes a lot of photos and is into advanced photo editing and high-quality imaging, being able to take TIFF and RAW images with my phone is awesome. But for some reason, when this app creates the DNG file it downscales the resolution of the image. I love how this app lets you save to multiple file formats at the same time, but unfortunately I rarely, if ever, find myself actually editing and then using the RAW image. There&#39;s nothing wrong with TIFF format, but honestly I see no reason for RAW support if the image that it creates is drastically downscaled. Maybe it does this to save storage space, since RAW files are very large, but the iPhone has a 12 megapixel sensor. I would really like to be able to use all of my pixels in RAW format.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been a customer since tap~tap~tap first started. I watched it get better and better. I don&#39;t know if the creators remember me but a few Years ago I wrote a manual. Basically I took their  user manual which were in no specific order on line and printed them all. Then made dividers between the sections and designed a slick looking title cover. I took a few pictures and sent them to the creators. I only did this for myself because I love this app. I&#39;ve probably this app to over 150 people and they became believers. Actually this type stuff I do for a living. I&#39;m a marketing director for a medium sized firm and making a user manual was kind of fun. But it&#39;s obsolete now. The technology is so advanced that anything you do will be no good because of changes. This app has come a long way. For those who have read this, order this and if there&#39;s any charges for add ons buy them! You so t be sorry. There is no one app better then this in the entire world. I commend the engineering photographic experts for their many hours of hard work. I hope that you all have achieved your rewards and payback time. Thanks a ton for your work. <br />Jimmy</p>

We fixed a problem where only the original was saved, if the app was configured to use Revertible Edits and any of the High Quality image formats.\n* Fixed an occasional crash in iOS 11.2 that could happen when visiting the Lightbox. It took us a long time to discover it, as it was a rare incompatibility with iOS versions earlier than 11.3, and regretfully the system did not generate a crash report for us.\n* Fixed another occasional crash when copying photos from the Lightbox, when TIFF was the selected quality setting. This one was fully our fault.\n* When the square crop was selected, sometimes the images produced were not exactly square but one-pixel off. Our square cropping calculation should now be precise. We have our share of OCD developers, but this problem still slipped through somehow.\n* In the Chinese and Spanish localizations, HEIF had been mistakenly translated as TIFF in the export dialogs, possibly creating confusion among those fine folk. Our apologies.","releaseDate":"2018-05-29"},{"versionDisplay":"10.11","releaseNotes":"No more Macro crashes in iOS 10\n\nAttempting to shoot Macro pictures in TIFF quality caused a crash in iOS 10, which has been fixed. Thanks to Meri (@iphoneartgirl) for pointing this out!\n\nBetter low-disk space handling\n\nWe have improved the way Camera+ deals with devices that have very little free space left. It will now refuse to perform certain actions (exporting your photos) if you are low on free space. That's better than blindly attempting the operation and making things worse.\n\nOther fixes\n\n. The Lightbox film sprockets were displaying inconsistently. They now behave as expected, even for photos that have a RAW representation.\n. A couple of other very infrequent crashes have been fixed.","releaseDate":"2018-03-13"},{"versionDisplay":"10.10.12","releaseNotes":"This update is about reliability, for the most part: we have fixed a number of issues you guys have reported, and have tried to do it carefully so we don't break anything else. Fixing bugs and testing is only so much fun, so we couldn't help but to squeeze a couple of other niceties along the way. Details below.\n\nCopy \u0026 Paste Edits\n\nWant to transfer your carefully applied edits to another photo? Select the edited photo in your Lightbox, long tap the Edit button and then select Copy Edits. Select another photo, long tap Edit, and then Paste Edits. Compatible edits will be transferred, but things like Portrait mode will only attach if the destination photo was captured with depth information.\n\nAssorted UI \u0026 Workflow Improvements\n\n. The editing extension has been improved to display better in iPhone X. It was serviceable before, but it's nicer now.\n. When sharing multiple photos to Files in iOS 11, a nasty repetitive dialog appeared to confirm the name of the transferred files. We got rid of that.\n. Also in the sharing department, sharing unedited photos to WhatsApp failed if the photos had been captured in wide color, because apparently WhatsApp gets confused with the extended color information.\n. About color spaces: a badge indicating the color space is now displayed in the summary Info of the photo. It's been always there for JPEG photos, we added it to HEIFs and TIFFs.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n. We fixed the crashes we found.\n. When shooting RAW, we were always saving the DNG representation combined with the JPEG/HEIF asset, even if you had chosen to save it as an independent file. The setting is now correctly honored. However, please note that this only applies to photos being saved to the Camera Roll; the Lightbox always uses the combined representation.\n. We forgot to include the translation for a couple of error messages in the last update, so they always appeared in English. Those translations have been incorporated now.\n. Sometimes the UI would end up in a weird state after adding a new sharing service. Fixed.\n. We have optimized the memory usage in the iPhone 6, specially when shooting TIFF and macro.","releaseDate":"2018-01-04"},{"versionDisplay":"10.10.11","releaseNotes":"This is a bug fix release.","releaseDate":"2017-12-05"},{"versionDisplay":"10.10.10","releaseNotes":"Camera+ 10.10.10 (or 10.X.X, as we call it affectionately) is our iPhone X release.

Under iOS 10 we weren’t allowed to read depth information from the system so we couldn’t do anything like that. This all changed in iOS 11 - we are very happy to report that you can now capture Depth photos inside your favorite shooting app.\n\nNote that we said \"Depth\" and not \"Portrait\" above. That's because you can use that information not only for portraits, but for a variety of other creative purposes as well. Most of the editing tools in The Lab have been enhanced to support Depth. This means you can now desaturate the background so the foreground pops in vivid color, or apply exposure compensation to a distant area of the image. We can't wait to see what you’ll be able to do with it. Oh, and for those of you wondering, it works for pictures taken with the system camera too - if you have Portrait photos in your album, feel free to import them into Camera+ and see what you can achieve in The Lab.\n\nAll-new Camera Design\n\nIn Camera+ 10 we turned our attention to the camera itself. We came up with a new design that feels completely at home in iOS 11 but, more importantly, we’ve made sure that the most frequently used features and settings are closer at hand and easier to find. A new shooting bar is always present at the top of the screen, giving you quick access to the new Portrait/Depth mode, to the beloved Macro mode, and to frequently used controls such as the flash and the camera switcher.\n\nBy tapping on the small (+) button next to the shutter you'll have easy access to tons of useful settings. You no longer need to open the menu to toggle the grid or the horizon level, and you can also quickly enable RAW capture. Additional shooting modes have been made available in that same place. Since it was getting a little crowded in there, we decided to introduce a 3D carousel you can flip to access whatever mode you want to try. One of the additions we are most proud of is the new Smile mode - it works like the stabilizer, but for smiles. Have you ever found yourself in a position where you are trying to shoot a selfie and got the framing just right, only to find you can't reach the shutter? Now you can simply smile, and the photo will be shot. It doesn't need to be selfies, it works for the back camera too, and for any number of people - just point the camera at them and tell a funny joke.\n\nOne last important detail in the camera is that now your viewfinder is always accurate. No matter what device you use, what your settings are or what controls you have on screen, the viewfinder will always show the exact area that will be captured. This was important for those photographers among you that like to carefully frame their photos, so we made sure that you get what you see.\n\nHEIF format\n\nCamera+ 10 supports the efficient HEIF format across the board. This image file format promises better efficiency than the more well-known JPEG. This means that if you do nothing, your photos will magically take up less space and will look the same or even better. Personally, we recommend you leave it on! The only downside is that HEIF is a relatively new format, so it still does not enjoy as much support as the venerable JPEG does. If you need to transfer your photos to a computer to continue working on them and are worried about compatibility, you can always choose to save your files in JPEG.","releaseDate":"2017-10-06"},{"versionDisplay":"10","releaseNotes":"Camera+ 10 arrives with full depth support, HEIF, accurate viewfinder and smiles!\n\nWe love the Portrait mode that Apple introduced in the dual-lens iPhones - y’know, that feature where you take a close-up and the background is nicely blurred and faded to draw attention to your main subject.

So you can now either save them as single combined photos or separate each into two, with one being the RAW DNG (digital negative). Separating the photos can make it easier to deal with them if, for instance, you move them to a computer for further processing.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve added options so that you can export either just the JPEG/TIFF portions or just the RAW portions to your Camera Roll. You can access these new export features via the action button in the RAW Lab, and via long press or 3D Touch on the Save button in the Lightbox.\n\nDid somebody just say 3D Touch??\n\nAlong these lines, we’ve also added 3D Touch capabilities to several areas of Camera+. Most notably, you can now 3D Touch the Lightbox icon right from the camera screen to access the most recent photo in your Lightbox. So now you have zippy access to the last photo you’ve shot and you can do things like copy it… save it… or share it without having to jump into the Lightbox. You can now even quickly delete those inadvertent thumb shots and unwanted photobombs right from the camera screen. Nifty, eh?\n\nBut we caught the 3D Touch Fever and didn’t stop there… so you can now 3D Touch various elements in the Lightbox, too. “Precisely what?” you ask? Well, where would the fun be in that if we just told you. For those of you with 3D Touch-capable devices, you know that 7/8 of the fun of 3D Touch is the mystery-meat aspect of it where you just start jamming your thumb on various things and hope that something magical will peek and/or pop. So we won’t ruin that experience for you by telling you anything further. Consider it an early Easter Egg hunt. Enjoy!\n\nMoving back into the 2D realm where there are far less mysteries \u0026 surprises… we’ve renamed the AutoSave section of the menu to Save because we’ve added some save-related functionality and it all lives nicely under that heading now. The new functionality is a feature that enables you to choose between either revertible or non-revertible edits when you save your pics to your Camera Roll. Revertible pro: you’re able to undo any edits to your photos, even after saving them. Revertible con: saved photos take up more space on your device. And vice-versa for non-revertible, of course. Sidenote: Autocorrect has been beaten to submission regarding trying to change “revertible” to “reversible”. WIN!\n\nFor you metadata geeks who like to be all in-the-know, we’ve added a few niceties, along with some spit \u0026 polish to the ever-informative Info panel.\n\nAnd finally… coming to you directly from the Department of When You Remove Existing Features, It’s Guaranteed to Bite You in the You Know What, No Matter How Insignificant You Think They Are: we’ve added a “new” JPEG Downscaled quality option to compensate for the recently removed Optimized option. Or you can look at it as us “re-introducing” it with a different name and better functionality. Or mayyybe even “un-retiring” it? Take your pick. We’ll just be over here growling, but with our tail between our collective legs…\n\nIf you peer over the horizon, you just might be able to catch a glimpse of Camera+ 10 making its way toward you.

You’re now able to explicitly choose to shoot with the wide angle or telephoto lens so you can get exactly the lens you desire for the given shooting situation. If you prefer the simplicity of not having to think about those sorts of things like lens pickin’, you can just keep the lens switcher set to Duo mode and let your iPhone 7 Plus do its magic.\n\nOne thing worth knowing along these lines is that in Apple’s Camera app, the 2× zoom button sort of implies that it behaves as a wide angle / tele switcher, but it’s actually not (sometimes it’s a wide/tele switcher… sometimes it’s a 2× digital zoom button… and sometimes it’s something else altogether). The “tell” here is if you set it to 2× then put a finger over the tele lens (the one on the right side if you’re looking at the back of the phone). If you’re expecting to snap a pic of your finger, you’ll be surprised in some situations… when lighting conditions are relatively dark, the system will use the wide angle lens (to prevent an underexposed photo, since the tele lens has a higher ƒ-number of 2.8 than the wide angle lens’ ƒ-number of 1.8… in other words, this somewhat confusingly means it has a smaller aperture, which therefore lets in less light). Now to make a long story even longer, one of the benefits of the dual lenses is that the system can combine info from both lenses, resulting in a better photo than one taken with a single lens. In any case, we’ve implemented our Duo lens mode to be consistent with Apple’s Camera behavior, but we’ve also enabled you to choose precisely which lens you want.

His name was 6 Plus. When he was born, he got all the attention. Then around a year later, his parents gave birth to his brother, who was given the name 6S Plus. Sadly, most of the attention given to 6 Plus started to shift over to 6S Plus. This made 6 Plus very angry and petulant and made him act out in ways somewhat unbecoming of a young lad… like crashing when using Camera+ 8. Because sometimes even negative attention is better than no attention at all. But Camera+ didn’t like all the negative attention that was bestowed upon itself… in the form of 1-star reviews. So Camera+ had a little chat with 6 Plus and helped it work out its grievances. And everyone lived happily ever after in a perfect 5-star world!\n\n~ THE END ~\n\n\nWhat’s new in Camera+ 8\n\nSlow Shutter\nBy far, the biggest addition to Camera+ 8 is an innovative slow shutter feature. When you’re shooting in the manual modes, you can now have effective shutter speeds as long as 30 seconds. So now you’ll be able to do things like take those kinds of amazing, misty, creamy waterfall photos that you see in magazines. And you’ll be able to do some creative night photography. It opens your iPhone photography up to so many new possibilities that are only limited to whatever your imagination can conjure up.\n\nUltra-low ISO\nWorking hand-in-hand with the new extended range of shutter speeds is an extended range of effective ISO values. With this range, you’ll be able to get down to unbelievably low apparent ISO values to make it possible to take long exposure photos without having to resort to using things like ND filters to prevent your photos from blowing out. And throughout the extended shutter speed / ISO range, the preview you see in your viewfinder is a very good indicator of what you’ll be capturing as far as exposure goes, so there’s little to no guesswork when you’re doing long exposure photography… not even the most expensive DSLR cameras can make that claim.\n\nPlease note that these new slow shutter / low ISO features aren’t available on the various flavors of iPhone 5.\n\nNew Import Options\nWe’ve added a couple of import options to help you get your latest photos from your Photo Library and into your Lightbox. Now you can easily import the last photo you shot… and you can even import your whole last moment with just a couple of taps.\n\nA new share thingy\nWhen you have a share sheet open in an app, those square, rounded-cornered, monochromatic icons in the bottom row are called Action Extensions. The nomenclature might leave a bit to be desired but it’s hard to debate the usefulness of these items. And on that note, we’ve added a Camera+ Action Extension so that you can now easily send photos to your Lightbox right from the share sheet of most apps. \n\nNotification Center Widget Import Option\nThere’s a new option for the Notification Center Widget that enables you to quickly import photos from your Photo Library to your Lightbox.\n\nBug Fixes\nAs always, with new features inevitably come new bugs. And with new releases, we always do our best to squarsch as many known bugs as we can. In this release, many of the lifeless arthropodæ can be found in the vicinity of the Apple Watch.\n\nWhat’s New\nAnd finally, there’s a new “What’s New” section in the menu to make it easy for you to see, um… what’s new.

Which caused some crashes for some of you experimenting with manual controls. Oh, and the ghost of iOS 8 came back to haunt our attic. Kelvin’s doing much better now and the ghost has been busted.\n\n\nWhat’s new in Camera+ 8\n\nSlow Shutter\nBy far, the biggest addition to Camera+ 8 is an innovative slow shutter feature. When you’re shooting in the manual modes, you can now have effective shutter speeds as long as 30 seconds. So now you’ll be able to do things like take those kinds of amazing, misty, creamy waterfall photos that you see in magazines. And you’ll be able to do some creative night photography. It opens your iPhone photography up to so many new possibilities that are only limited to whatever your imagination can conjure up.\n\nUltra-low ISO\nWorking hand-in-hand with the new extended range of shutter speeds is an extended range of effective ISO values. With this range, you’ll be able to get down to unbelievably low apparent ISO values to make it possible to take long exposure photos without having to resort to using things like ND filters to prevent your photos from blowing out. And throughout the extended shutter speed / ISO range, the preview you see in your viewfinder is a very good indicator of what you’ll be capturing as far as exposure goes, so there’s little to no guesswork when you’re doing long exposure photography… not even the most expensive DSLR cameras can make that claim.\n\nPlease note that these new slow shutter / low ISO features require a decent amount of processing mojo, so these features aren’t available on the various flavors of iPhone 5. We vaporized a 5c or two in early testing so we felt the need to disable it on those devices. With great power comes great responsibility… to not melt phones.\n\nWe’re really excited and very much looking forward to seeing what kinds of creative photography you’re able to achieve with these new extended shutter speed and ISO ranges in Camera+ 8!\n\nNew Import Options\nWe’ve added a couple of import options to help you get your latest photos from your Photo Library and into your Lightbox. Now you can easily import the last photo you shot… and you can even import your whole last moment with just a couple of taps.\n\nA new share thingy\nWhen you have a share sheet open in an app, those square, rounded-cornered, monochromatic icons in the bottom row are called Action Extensions. The nomenclature might leave a bit to be desired but it’s hard to debate the usefulness of these items. And on that note, we’ve added a Camera+ Action Extension so that you can now easily send photos to your Lightbox right from the share sheet of most apps. Be sure to peruse the Extensions section of the menu for the 411 on how to enable this nifty, useful new feature.\n\nNotification Center Widget Import Option\nThere’s a new option for the Notification Center Widget that enables you to quickly import photos from your Photo Library to your Lightbox.  Check-out the Extensions section of the menu to square away how to do it.\n\nBug Fixes\nAs always, with new features inevitably come new bugs. And with new releases, we always do our best to squarsch as many known bugs as we can. In this release, many of the lifeless arthropodæ can be found in the vicinity of the Apple Watch.\n\nWhat’s New\nAnd finally, there’s a new “What’s New” section in the menu to make it easy for you to see, um… what’s new. You know… this thing that you’re actually reading right now. We would’ve inserted a screenshot here to show it, but the warranty on your iPhone doesn’t cover the damages that’d be caused by the black hole created by doing so.","releaseDate":"2016-06-11"},{"versionDisplay":"8","releaseNotes":"Slow Shutter\nBy far, the biggest addition to Camera+ 8 is an innovative slow shutter feature.

The fact that this app lets you shoot in RAW and TIFF is awesome. As someone who takes a lot of photos and is into advanced photo editing and high-quality imaging, being able to take TIFF and RAW images with my phone is awesome. But for some reason, when this app creates the DNG file it downscales the resolution of the image. I love how this app lets you save to multiple file formats at the same time, but unfortunately I rarely, if ever, find myself actually editing and then using the RAW image. There's nothing wrong with TIFF format, but honestly I see no reason for RAW support if the image that it creates is drastically downscaled. Maybe it does this to save storage space, since RAW files are very large, but the iPhone has a 12 megapixel sensor. I would really like to be able to use all of my pixels in RAW format.","title":"AWESOME App, 1 Drawback","userName":"Hstudio00"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1682376605","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2017-07-14T18:45:30Z","rating":5,"review":"I have been a customer since tap~tap~tap first started.

I sincerely appreciate it. \n\nThat said I noticed a minor issue in the integration that I hope you will address; when routing images through the iPhone x’s native Photos app, the window shade that replaced the home button cuts off icons and text in the lower portion of the screen. I bring it up because it seems that going through camera+’s lightbox software ultimately creates more steps.\n\nIt would also be handy to include a specific  11x17 and 10x13 crop feature so we may all utilize the printers available to us.\n\nMoving forward it may be wise for the developers to look into what is currently readily accessible for frames and mattes, (ie whatever is available cheap on a big box craft store shelf). \n\nI would also encourage them to look into a method of upscaling a lower resolution image in acceptable way. The app has told me repeatedly that it must save at a lower resolution than the imported photo. That is unacceptable, especially with the new processors available in most phones. Offering it as an in-app purchase might be might be a way to wrangle a few extra bucks out of the power users.\n\nAll that being said, it’s still a five star app. Keep up the good work, it’s appreciated.\n\nPlease resist the urge to use the subscription model.

Yeah you! Shouldn't you be looking for Camera+ 2 instead? Our newest app has been rebuilt from the ground app to support the next 10 years (or 20, who knows?) of mobile photography. Check it out at http://camera.plus \n\nOver 10 million sold!\n\n“The Clarity filter is iPhone photography’s secret sauce—it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.”\n— Kevin Sintumuang, The Wall Street Journal\n\n“If the iPhone’s standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens.”\n— TIME: 50 Best iPhone Apps 2011\n\n“improves on almost every aspect of the built-in camera app”\n— Charlie Sorrel, Wired\n\nWinner: Best Visual Design, Best Photography App\n— Best App Ever Awards\n\n\nIt’s all about one thing... great photos!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned photographer or someone who’s barely touched a camera, Camera+ will make you love taking photos.\n\nTouch Exposure \u0026 Focus\nSet exposure separately from focus. You can now easily control how light or dark your shots come out.\n\nShooting Modes\nUse the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.\n\nDigital Zoom\nUp to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.\n\nFront Flash\nHow many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!\n\nHorizon Level\nUse the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.\n\nClarity\nClarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.\n\nScene Modes\nMost modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.\n\nEffects\nProfessional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.\n\nLightbox\nAll the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots. You save only the photos you’re satisfied with so that your camera roll stays neat and clean.\n\nSharing\nWhether you want to show your results to your friends and family or the whole world, Camera+ has got you covered. Proudly share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Or go the more personal route and email or message them from right within the app.\n\niCloud Lightbox sync\nAutomatically sync your Camera+ photos between all of your devices. Shoot all day on your iPhone… and then edit at night on your iPad. \n\nCrops\nIf you didn’t line-up your shot perfectly when you took it, you can easily fix that with Camera+. And when you want to get a bit creative, we setup a bunch of popular crop sizes for you. With a single tap, you can make your pics square, 4×6, 8×10, and more.\n\nBorders\nWith Camera+ you get several great border designs, from simple black and white borders to more gritty designs, you’ll be able to add wonderful finishing touches.\n\nCaptions\nHave some fun with your photos by putting captions on them. It’s a great way to really personalize your favorite shots."},"versionHistory":[{"versionDisplay":"10.20","releaseNotes":"In this release we added iOS 14 and iPhone 12 support, and fixed some bugs.","releaseDate":"2020-11-27"},{"versionDisplay":"10.19.1","releaseNotes":"In this release we have fixed an issue with capturing slow shutter pictures.","releaseDate":"2020-05-14"},{"versionDisplay":"10.19","releaseNotes":"Bug fixes and performance improvements.","releaseDate":"2020-05-07"},{"versionDisplay":"10.18","releaseNotes":"In this release we have further improved iOS 13 support and fixed several other issues.","releaseDate":"2019-10-18"},{"versionDisplay":"10.17","releaseNotes":"In this update we have added iOS 13 along with the new iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro line.","releaseDate":"2019-09-27"},{"versionDisplay":"10.16","releaseNotes":"In this update we have added iOS 12 and the new iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max support.","releaseDate":"2018-09-29"},{"versionDisplay":"10.15","releaseNotes":"If you love Camera+ 2 but didn't want to clutter your Photo Library with the contents of your Lightbox, you can now easily migrate all your photos to their spiffy new home!\n\nSimply tap on the migration button that automatically appears or select the new migration option in the Menu.

We fixed a problem where only the original was saved, if the app was configured to use Revertible Edits and any of the High Quality image formats.\n* Fixed an occasional crash in iOS 11.2 that could happen when visiting the Lightbox. It took us a long time to discover it, as it was a rare incompatibility with iOS versions earlier than 11.3, and regretfully the system did not generate a crash report for us.\n* Fixed another occasional crash when copying photos from the Lightbox, when TIFF was the selected quality setting. This one was fully our fault.\n* When the square crop was selected, sometimes the images produced were not exactly square but one-pixel off. Our square cropping calculation should now be precise. We have our share of OCD developers, but this problem still slipped through somehow.\n* In the Chinese and Spanish localizations, HEIF had been mistakenly translated as TIFF in the export dialogs, possibly creating confusion among those fine folk. Our apologies.","releaseDate":"2018-05-29"},{"versionDisplay":"10.11","releaseNotes":"No more Macro crashes in iOS 10\n\nAttempting to shoot Macro pictures in TIFF quality caused a crash in iOS 10, which has been fixed. Thanks to Meri (@iphoneartgirl) for pointing this out!\n\nBetter low-disk space handling\n\nWe have improved the way Camera+ deals with devices that have very little free space left. It will now refuse to perform certain actions (exporting your photos) if you are low on free space. That's better than blindly attempting the operation and making things worse.\n\nOther fixes\n\n. The Lightbox film sprockets were displaying inconsistently. They now behave as expected, even for photos that have a RAW representation.\n. A couple of other very infrequent crashes have been fixed.","releaseDate":"2018-03-13"},{"versionDisplay":"10.10.12","releaseNotes":"This update is about reliability, for the most part: we have fixed a number of issues you guys have reported, and have tried to do it carefully so we don't break anything else. Fixing bugs and testing is only so much fun, so we couldn't help but to squeeze a couple of other niceties along the way. Details below.\n\nCopy \u0026 Paste Edits\n\nWant to transfer your carefully applied edits to another photo? Select the edited photo in your Lightbox, long tap the Edit button and then select Copy Edits. Select another photo, long tap Edit, and then Paste Edits. Compatible edits will be transferred, but things like Portrait mode will only attach if the destination photo was captured with depth information.\n\nAssorted UI \u0026 Workflow Improvements\n\n. The editing extension has been improved to display better in iPhone X. It was serviceable before, but it's nicer now.\n. When sharing multiple photos to Files in iOS 11, a nasty repetitive dialog appeared to confirm the name of the transferred files. We got rid of that.\n. Also in the sharing department, sharing unedited photos to WhatsApp failed if the photos had been captured in wide color, because apparently WhatsApp gets confused with the extended color information.\n. About color spaces: a badge indicating the color space is now displayed in the summary Info of the photo. It's been always there for JPEG photos, we added it to HEIFs and TIFFs.\n\nBug Fixes\n\n. We fixed the crashes we found.\n. When shooting RAW, we were always saving the DNG representation combined with the JPEG/HEIF asset, even if you had chosen to save it as an independent file. The setting is now correctly honored. However, please note that this only applies to photos being saved to the Camera Roll; the Lightbox always uses the combined representation.\n. We forgot to include the translation for a couple of error messages in the last update, so they always appeared in English. Those translations have been incorporated now.\n. Sometimes the UI would end up in a weird state after adding a new sharing service. Fixed.\n. We have optimized the memory usage in the iPhone 6, specially when shooting TIFF and macro.","releaseDate":"2018-01-04"},{"versionDisplay":"10.10.11","releaseNotes":"This is a bug fix release.","releaseDate":"2017-12-05"},{"versionDisplay":"10.10.10","releaseNotes":"Camera+ 10.10.10 (or 10.X.X, as we call it affectionately) is our iPhone X release.

Under iOS 10 we weren’t allowed to read depth information from the system so we couldn’t do anything like that. This all changed in iOS 11 - we are very happy to report that you can now capture Depth photos inside your favorite shooting app.\n\nNote that we said \"Depth\" and not \"Portrait\" above. That's because you can use that information not only for portraits, but for a variety of other creative purposes as well. Most of the editing tools in The Lab have been enhanced to support Depth. This means you can now desaturate the background so the foreground pops in vivid color, or apply exposure compensation to a distant area of the image. We can't wait to see what you’ll be able to do with it. Oh, and for those of you wondering, it works for pictures taken with the system camera too - if you have Portrait photos in your album, feel free to import them into Camera+ and see what you can achieve in The Lab.\n\nAll-new Camera Design\n\nIn Camera+ 10 we turned our attention to the camera itself. We came up with a new design that feels completely at home in iOS 11 but, more importantly, we’ve made sure that the most frequently used features and settings are closer at hand and easier to find. A new shooting bar is always present at the top of the screen, giving you quick access to the new Portrait/Depth mode, to the beloved Macro mode, and to frequently used controls such as the flash and the camera switcher.\n\nBy tapping on the small (+) button next to the shutter you'll have easy access to tons of useful settings. You no longer need to open the menu to toggle the grid or the horizon level, and you can also quickly enable RAW capture. Additional shooting modes have been made available in that same place. Since it was getting a little crowded in there, we decided to introduce a 3D carousel you can flip to access whatever mode you want to try. One of the additions we are most proud of is the new Smile mode - it works like the stabilizer, but for smiles. Have you ever found yourself in a position where you are trying to shoot a selfie and got the framing just right, only to find you can't reach the shutter? Now you can simply smile, and the photo will be shot. It doesn't need to be selfies, it works for the back camera too, and for any number of people - just point the camera at them and tell a funny joke.\n\nOne last important detail in the camera is that now your viewfinder is always accurate. No matter what device you use, what your settings are or what controls you have on screen, the viewfinder will always show the exact area that will be captured. This was important for those photographers among you that like to carefully frame their photos, so we made sure that you get what you see.\n\nHEIF format\n\nCamera+ 10 supports the efficient HEIF format across the board. This image file format promises better efficiency than the more well-known JPEG. This means that if you do nothing, your photos will magically take up less space and will look the same or even better. Personally, we recommend you leave it on! The only downside is that HEIF is a relatively new format, so it still does not enjoy as much support as the venerable JPEG does. If you need to transfer your photos to a computer to continue working on them and are worried about compatibility, you can always choose to save your files in JPEG.","releaseDate":"2017-10-06"},{"versionDisplay":"10","releaseNotes":"Camera+ 10 arrives with full depth support, HEIF, accurate viewfinder and smiles!\n\nWe love the Portrait mode that Apple introduced in the dual-lens iPhones - y’know, that feature where you take a close-up and the background is nicely blurred and faded to draw attention to your main subject.

So you can now either save them as single combined photos or separate each into two, with one being the RAW DNG (digital negative). Separating the photos can make it easier to deal with them if, for instance, you move them to a computer for further processing.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve added options so that you can export either just the JPEG/TIFF portions or just the RAW portions to your Camera Roll. You can access these new export features via the action button in the RAW Lab, and via long press or 3D Touch on the Save button in the Lightbox.\n\nDid somebody just say 3D Touch??\n\nAlong these lines, we’ve also added 3D Touch capabilities to several areas of Camera+. Most notably, you can now 3D Touch the Lightbox icon right from the camera screen to access the most recent photo in your Lightbox. So now you have zippy access to the last photo you’ve shot and you can do things like copy it… save it… or share it without having to jump into the Lightbox. You can now even quickly delete those inadvertent thumb shots and unwanted photobombs right from the camera screen. Nifty, eh?\n\nBut we caught the 3D Touch Fever and didn’t stop there… so you can now 3D Touch various elements in the Lightbox, too. “Precisely what?” you ask? Well, where would the fun be in that if we just told you. For those of you with 3D Touch-capable devices, you know that 7/8 of the fun of 3D Touch is the mystery-meat aspect of it where you just start jamming your thumb on various things and hope that something magical will peek and/or pop. So we won’t ruin that experience for you by telling you anything further. Consider it an early Easter Egg hunt. Enjoy!\n\nMoving back into the 2D realm where there are far less mysteries \u0026 surprises… we’ve renamed the AutoSave section of the menu to Save because we’ve added some save-related functionality and it all lives nicely under that heading now. The new functionality is a feature that enables you to choose between either revertible or non-revertible edits when you save your pics to your Camera Roll. Revertible pro: you’re able to undo any edits to your photos, even after saving them. Revertible con: saved photos take up more space on your device. And vice-versa for non-revertible, of course. Sidenote: Autocorrect has been beaten to submission regarding trying to change “revertible” to “reversible”. WIN!\n\nFor you metadata geeks who like to be all in-the-know, we’ve added a few niceties, along with some spit \u0026 polish to the ever-informative Info panel.\n\nAnd finally… coming to you directly from the Department of When You Remove Existing Features, It’s Guaranteed to Bite You in the You Know What, No Matter How Insignificant You Think They Are: we’ve added a “new” JPEG Downscaled quality option to compensate for the recently removed Optimized option. Or you can look at it as us “re-introducing” it with a different name and better functionality. Or mayyybe even “un-retiring” it? Take your pick. We’ll just be over here growling, but with our tail between our collective legs…\n\nIf you peer over the horizon, you just might be able to catch a glimpse of Camera+ 10 making its way toward you.

You’re now able to explicitly choose to shoot with the wide angle or telephoto lens so you can get exactly the lens you desire for the given shooting situation. If you prefer the simplicity of not having to think about those sorts of things like lens pickin’, you can just keep the lens switcher set to Duo mode and let your iPhone 7 Plus do its magic.\n\nOne thing worth knowing along these lines is that in Apple’s Camera app, the 2× zoom button sort of implies that it behaves as a wide angle / tele switcher, but it’s actually not (sometimes it’s a wide/tele switcher… sometimes it’s a 2× digital zoom button… and sometimes it’s something else altogether). The “tell” here is if you set it to 2× then put a finger over the tele lens (the one on the right side if you’re looking at the back of the phone). If you’re expecting to snap a pic of your finger, you’ll be surprised in some situations… when lighting conditions are relatively dark, the system will use the wide angle lens (to prevent an underexposed photo, since the tele lens has a higher ƒ-number of 2.8 than the wide angle lens’ ƒ-number of 1.8… in other words, this somewhat confusingly means it has a smaller aperture, which therefore lets in less light). Now to make a long story even longer, one of the benefits of the dual lenses is that the system can combine info from both lenses, resulting in a better photo than one taken with a single lens. In any case, we’ve implemented our Duo lens mode to be consistent with Apple’s Camera behavior, but we’ve also enabled you to choose precisely which lens you want. Hopefully at least some of you will have found at least some of this informative. Undoubtedly, some others of you have had a flashback to some high school science class, have fallen asleep by now, and are drooling on your desk. The More You Know :STARSWOOSH:\n\n\nRAW shooting\n\nIf you’re using an iPhone 6s, 6s Plus, SE, 7, or 7 Plus, you now have the privilege of shooting in RAW. You’ll find this new setting in the (newly renamed) Quality \u0026 Format menu. For those of you not in the know, shooting in RAW can provide you with the highest quality shots your iPhone camera is capable of taking. RAW photos actually store more information than normal JPEG or TIFF photos, so when you edit these photos, you’ll have the opportunity to pull out otherwise lost details to help you achieve the perfect photo.\n\n\nRAW editing\n\nTo go hand-in-hand with RAW shooting, we’ve added the capabilities for you to make adjustments to the pics you’ve shot in RAW. The way to look at this in the world of Camera+ is that the photos that come out of your camera sensor have some processing applied to them by the system. The items that end up in your Lightbox right after shooting are the “developed” versions of these photos. You can then edit them using Camera+’s suite of editing tools like The Lab and apply our various filters to them. But now, with RAW thrown into the picture (bad pun’d), you have the opportunity to “re-develop” the pics fresh from your camera using a new suite of editing tools we call the RAW Lab.","releaseDate":"2016-12-21"},{"versionDisplay":"9.0.1","releaseNotes":"9.0.1 Emergency Bugfix Alert\n\nWe interrupt your Camera+ 9 shooting adventures to let you know that we’ve just put out a Camera+ 9.0.1 emergency bugfix release.

It’s a taste of the future of mobile device user experience and it’s surprising that Apple hasn’t done more to promote it. So we’re helping do just that by tastefully including haptic feedback throughout Camera+ 9 and letting you know about it. Haptic feedback brings new life to elements like the Camera+ shooting control wheels and once you’ve experienced it, you’ll definitely miss it when you’re using a device that hasn’t been blessed with this very cool, new feature.","releaseDate":"2016-12-14"},{"versionDisplay":"8.0.2","releaseNotes":"What’s new in Camera+ 8.0.2\n\nA short tale of Sibling Rivalry…\n\nThere was once a young whippersnapper. His name was 6 Plus. When he was born, he got all the attention. Then around a year later, his parents gave birth to his brother, who was given the name 6S Plus. Sadly, most of the attention given to 6 Plus started to shift over to 6S Plus. This made 6 Plus very angry and petulant and made him act out in ways somewhat unbecoming of a young lad… like crashing when using Camera+ 8. Because sometimes even negative attention is better than no attention at all. But Camera+ didn’t like all the negative attention that was bestowed upon itself… in the form of 1-star reviews. So Camera+ had a little chat with 6 Plus and helped it work out its grievances. And everyone lived happily ever after in a perfect 5-star world!\n\n~ THE END ~\n\n\nWhat’s new in Camera+ 8\n\nSlow Shutter\nBy far, the biggest addition to Camera+ 8 is an innovative slow shutter feature. When you’re shooting in the manual modes, you can now have effective shutter speeds as long as 30 seconds. So now you’ll be able to do things like take those kinds of amazing, misty, creamy waterfall photos that you see in magazines. And you’ll be able to do some creative night photography. It opens your iPhone photography up to so many new possibilities that are only limited to whatever your imagination can conjure up.\n\nUltra-low ISO\nWorking hand-in-hand with the new extended range of shutter speeds is an extended range of effective ISO values. With this range, you’ll be able to get down to unbelievably low apparent ISO values to make it possible to take long exposure photos without having to resort to using things like ND filters to prevent your photos from blowing out. And throughout the extended shutter speed / ISO range, the preview you see in your viewfinder is a very good indicator of what you’ll be capturing as far as exposure goes, so there’s little to no guesswork when you’re doing long exposure photography… not even the most expensive DSLR cameras can make that claim.\n\nPlease note that these new slow shutter / low ISO features aren’t available on the various flavors of iPhone 5.\n\nNew Import Options\nWe’ve added a couple of import options to help you get your latest photos from your Photo Library and into your Lightbox. Now you can easily import the last photo you shot… and you can even import your whole last moment with just a couple of taps.\n\nA new share thingy\nWhen you have a share sheet open in an app, those square, rounded-cornered, monochromatic icons in the bottom row are called Action Extensions. The nomenclature might leave a bit to be desired but it’s hard to debate the usefulness of these items. And on that note, we’ve added a Camera+ Action Extension so that you can now easily send photos to your Lightbox right from the share sheet of most apps. \n\nNotification Center Widget Import Option\nThere’s a new option for the Notification Center Widget that enables you to quickly import photos from your Photo Library to your Lightbox.\n\nBug Fixes\nAs always, with new features inevitably come new bugs. And with new releases, we always do our best to squarsch as many known bugs as we can. In this release, many of the lifeless arthropodæ can be found in the vicinity of the Apple Watch.\n\nWhat’s New\nAnd finally, there’s a new “What’s New” section in the menu to make it easy for you to see, um… what’s new. You know… this thing that you’re actually reading right now.
