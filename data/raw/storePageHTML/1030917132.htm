      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I started using YogaAnytime when I moved from California to upstate New York, a big step toward true love but far away from my go-to yoga studios. I wasn’t sure how I was going to continue my yoga education and was so delighted to find this platform with so many world-class teachers and thoughtfully curated courses! The mobile app makes it possible for me to learn or practice anywhere I have phone service. I love the option to share classes with friends who are not yet on the platform and am quick to recommend it to anyone who wants to begin or deepens their yoga practice. Thank you YogaAnytime!!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I really appreciate the shows feature, as it allows me to choose a course that fits my experience.  For example, I’m a teacher and currently feeling a lot of stress and burnout.  I started the yoga for anxiety show and it is very helpful. I especially appreciate that the shows are like courses, and not just one class that I’d have to repeat every day.   I thought I would just try it for a week and then cancel because of the cost, but it is definitely worth the monthly expense.</p>

Content (meaning any materials, including, without limitation, text, pictures, graphics, sound files and other files and the selection and arrangement thereof, the “Content”), that you make available publicly on the Site is generally displayed to other visitors to the Site. Content that you make available publicly may be collected and used by others, and we cannot control what other users do with this Content.\n\nSocial Media. Social media platforms and networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram that offer functionalities, plugins, widgets, or tools in connection with our website or mobile application (e.g., to log into an account, or to share inspiration, finds, purchases, and other content with your friends and followers on social media). If you choose to use these functionalities, plugins, widgets, or tools, certain information may be shared with or collected by those social media companies. For more information about what information is shared or collected, and how it is used, see the applicable social media company’s privacy policy. We will not, however, post to social sites as a default or spam your social media connections.\n\nTo Advertise. As explained above in the section entitled, “How Do We Use The Information Collected.”\n\nBy using the Site, you consent to us providing your information to third parties that assist us in the operation and delivery of our Site, products and services. We will take reasonable steps to require any such third parties to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy.\n\nYour information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy even if we undergo a business transition. However, we may transfer your information to a successor person or entity upon an acquisition or other corporate reorganization. You hereby consent to such transfers, and we may assign and transfer all of the rights, benefits, duties, and obligations of this Privacy Policy.\n\nIf you do not want us to share or disclose your information as stated herein, please do not use the Site or submit personally identifiable information.\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not provide access to your personally identifiable information to third parties for any purpose.\n\n6. What Are My Choices?\n\nYou can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to take advantage of some of our features. You also have the following options:\n\nReview and Update Your Account. If you have an account with us, you may review and update your account information (such as your name and contact information) online by making the appropriate selections or changes.\n\nTo protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or permitting the requested changes or modifications to be made. Unfortunately, we cannot always ensure that such changes or modifications will be reflected in all iterations of your information as previously stored.\nWe make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and the ability to correct the information if it is inaccurate or to delete it at your request (if it is not required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes). We may decline to process requests that we believe in good faith are unreasonable or unduly burdensome (such as requests that are repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be impractical to satisfy).\nPlease note that any information you disclose on public portions of the Site, such as “comments,” may become widespread. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personally identifiable information.\nChanging Services. You may add, edit, pause or remove services that you have subscribed to by logging onto the Site.\n\nDeactivate Your Account. You may deactivate your account with us at any time by making the appropriate selections. If you deactivate your account and later wish to reactivate it and again receive services from us, you may be required to re-enter your account information and again subscribe to any services you wish to receive. However, if you deactivate your account, we may retain certain information associated with your account for record keeping and legal compliance purposes. Further, we generally do not remove information that you have made publicly available, and information that has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy may be retained by those third parties and will be subject to their policies, and not this Privacy Policy.\n\nOpt Out. If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you a reasonable means to opt out of any such proposed use of personal information. We reserve the right to contact you on matters that we believe in good faith to be urgent or of particular importance, even if you opt out from other communications, but these would not include marketing communications.\n\n7. “Do Not Track”\n\nSome browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell those websites you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals.\n\n8. Security and Storage\n\nWe primarily store the information in the United States. Some information and personally identifiable information, however, may be maintained in servers we control and maintain or in third-party servers. The information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities in many different countries as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. By submitting your information, you agree to the transfer, storage, and processing of your data in accord with this Privacy Policy.\n\nThe personally identifiable information you provide to us is stored on servers that are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure reasonable security of such information. In addition, we restrict access to user personally identifiable information to those of our employees, independent contractors and agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain the Site. However, no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure nor can any be guaranteed to be totally secure, and, for this reason, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us. You can help protect your personally identifiable information by using a combination of letters, numbers and characters in your password, changing your password often, using a secure web browser, and signing off our Site when you are finished with its use.\n\nWe take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard and deter unauthorized access to your information. When we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a credit or debit card number, we use industry standard methods to protect that information. Although we take reasonable measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of your information, no e-commerce platform, application, website, electronic database or other format or system is completely secure.\n\n9. Third Party Websites\n\nThe Site contains links to other applications and/or websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party services. When you submit information or data to third parties, their privacy policies, not ours, will govern their use of your information and data. You should review the privacy policies and terms of service of all such third parties. We do not make any representations regarding the policies or practices of those third parties.\n\n10. Laws in Other Countries\n\nWe comply with the United States privacy laws and regulations. We do not represent that the Site is governed by, or operated in accordance with, the laws of other nations or jurisdictions, or that the Site or any portion of it is appropriate or available for use in any particular location. If you choose to access the Site, you do so at your own risk, and you are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. By using the Site, visitors to the Site from outside the United States acknowledge and agree that our Site is subject to United States laws and regulations, and waive any claims against us that may arise under their own national laws.\n\nThis Privacy Policy may be amended by us from time to time. Please periodically review the controlling version of the Privacy Policy. By continuing to use the Site after us making available an amended version of this Privacy Policy, you thereby acknowledge, agree and consent to such amendment. This Privacy Policy applies solely to our online information gathering and disclosure practices about the Site, and does not apply to any of our practices conducted off-line.\n\nLast Update: This Privacy Policy was most recently updated on December 21, 2018. The \"For Our Apps\" Section was added on March 30, 2020.\n\nQuestions: If you have any questions about either this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us by e-mail at contact@yogaanytime.com or by mail at: Yoga Anytime c/o Timeshift Media, Inc., 2150 Park Place, Suite 100, El Segundo, California 90245, USA\n\n© Timeshift Media, Inc. - 2020","is32bitOnly":false,"isStandaloneWithCompanionForWatchOS":false,"seller":"Timeshift Media, Inc.","isSiriSupported":false,"languageList":["English"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"description":{"standard":"Yoga Anytime offers over 1,500 yoga videos in HD quality with classes for all levels of experience.

What Information About Customers Does Yoga Anytime Collect?\n\nThe information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your Yoga Anytime experience.\n\nThe information we collect depends upon how you interact with us through the Site. We offer some services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal\n\ninformation to us. For example, you can read materials such as our blogs without providing personal information.\n\nWe do not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us. Personally identifiable information includes: (i) a first and last name; (ii) a physical address, including without limitation a street name and name of a city or town; (iii) an email address; (iv) a telephone number; and (v) any other identifier that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual.\n\nWe also collect non-personally identifiable information about you in different ways, including tracking your Internet activities through your internet protocol (IP) address, computer, tablet, mobile device, phone settings or most-recently visited URL. We may also ask you to directly provide certain non-personally identifiable information about yourself, such as preferences you have for specific features or services we provide.\n\nWe may store your personally identifiable information alongside non-personally identifiable information about you. Therefore, when you register with us and sign in to our Site, our Site will recognize you. This is so our Site can remember you and your preferences and customize your experience.\n\nHere is more information about the types of information we gather:\n\nInformation You Provide. When you sign up for a service that requires registration, we ask you for personal information such as your name and email address. We also collect information you provide when requesting a service, and this information may, among other things, include personal information or reveal details about your preferences. We typically store and maintain the information collected. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features.\n\nUser Communications. When you send email or other communications to us or post information on our Site (such as comments, feedback and likes), we retain those communications in order to process your request and improve our service.\n\nLogged Information. We automatically collect and store some information that you do not actively provide, such as your IP address, software and hardware attributes such as browser type, the date and time of your visit, videos viewed and the duration of videos viewed, and the last site you visited prior to visiting our Site.\n\nOther Internet Technology. We may use other technology, such as pixel tags and web beacons, which are invisible graphics on a web page or email that are programmed to collect non-personally identifiable information about the use of a given website or newsletter, such as whether or not an email is opened and viewed. We may include web beacons and/or pixel tags in email messages, newsletters, or other communications to track use of our Site and determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.\n\nGoogle Analytics. We have implemented certain Google Analytics Advertising Features. Google Analytics helps us analyze a user's behavior on our Site and what online channels they used to find the Site. We then can create audiences based on users’ behavior on the Site to send them relevant advertising. You may opt-out of these features using Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs, available here.\n\nSocial Media. We collect information from social media platforms and networks that you use in connection with our website or mobile application, or that share or allow you to share information with us, such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Instagram. For example, if you use functionalities, plugins, widgets, or tools from social media platforms or networks in connection with our website or mobile application (e.g., to log into an account, or to share inspiration, finds, purchases, and other content with your friends and followers on social media), we will collect the information that you share with us, or that those social media platforms or networks share with us. We use conversion tracking to help us measure the return on investment of our social media advertisements by reporting on the actions people take after viewing those ads. We create pixels that track conversions, add them to the pages of the Site where the conversions will happen, and then track these conversions back to advertisements. No personal information is contained in or collected as a result of using these cookies or pixels. For more information about social media platform and network privacy practices, please review the privacy policies and settings of the social media platforms and networks that you use. We will not, however, post to social sites as a default or spam your social media connections.\n\nThis Privacy Policy does not address the data management practices and policies of and information usage policies of other sites to which the Site may link to or on which a Yoga Anytime widget may be installed.\n\nWe do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not submit personally identifiable information to us or use the Site.\n\nIf you report a problem with our Site, there may be additional details requested. And if you contact us, we may keep a record of those communications. Should you sign up to an account using other social media platforms, we may also obtain your username and password details along with other information sent out by the related login page.\n\n3. What About Cookies?\n\nWhat are cookies? When you use the Site, we may insert some instructions on the device you are using to access our Site (such as your computer, tablet, or mobile device). These instructions will be in the form of a “cookie” or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of instruction stored on your hard drive or device, not on our Site. Cookies provide us with information that we use to enhance your experience on the Site.\n\nDisabling cookies. Right now, there are two basic types of cookies. One is a session cookie which terminates when the user’s session ends. The second is a persistent cookie, which is a text file that stays stored on your device for a period of time. Your Internet browser contains instructions about how to remove persistent cookies. If you reject all cookies, you may not be able to create or sign in to your account with us or otherwise take full advantage of our Site.\n\nWhy do we use cookies? We use cookies to collect information, on an aggregate basis, about how the Site is used. In other words, our cookies are not intended to identify you personally. The cookie information may include the date and time of visits to and time spent on the Site. We also use cookies to learn more about our audience size and usage patterns, to store information about your preferences to allow us to customize our Site according to your interests and provide a more personalized experience, to speed up searches or to recognize you when you return to our Site, to identify the pages viewed or searched for, page response times, download errors, length of visits, page interaction information (such as click, scrolling, etc.) or methods used to browse away from a page. You can obtain more information about cookies at All About Cookies.org.\n\n4. How Do We Use The Information Collected?\n\nIn general, we use personal and other information collected through the Site to fulfill your requests for services, contact you, customize content, and improve the design and performance of the Site. More specifically, we use personal and other information as follows:\n\nTo Communicate. We use your personal information to communicate with you generally, for example, to respond to a query from you, or to provide you with updates or information concerning our services or the services of other companies that we believe you may be interested in. For information regarding opting out of some of these communications, please see “What Are My Choices?” below.\n\nTo Provide Services and Customization. We use the information we gather to customize the content that you see on the Site and in associated communications. For example, the Site and associated communications from us may include information based on personal preferences and other information unique to you.\n\nTo Conduct Research. To improve our services, we conduct research on how our services are used. For example, we may request that you complete user surveys, and use the resulting data to improve the Site.\n\nTo Advertise.\n\nGoogle Analytics. We have implemented certain Google Analytics Advertising Features. Google Analytics helps us analyze a user's behavior on our Site and what online channels they used to find the Site. We then can create audiences based on users’ behavior on the Site to send them relevant advertising. You may opt-out of these features using Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs, available here.\nSocial Media. We use Facebook Custom Audiences and Facebook Lookalike Audiences to deliver advertisements to your or others with similar online behavior as you based on email addresses that we have collected.

You also have the following options:\n\nReview and Update Your Account. If you have an account with us, you may review and update your account information (such as your name and contact information) online by making the appropriate selections or changes.\n\nTo protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or permitting the requested changes or modifications to be made. Unfortunately, we cannot always ensure that such changes or modifications will be reflected in all iterations of your information as previously stored.\nWe make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and the ability to correct the information if it is inaccurate or to delete it at your request (if it is not required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes). We may decline to process requests that we believe in good faith are unreasonable or unduly burdensome (such as requests that are repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be impractical to satisfy).\nPlease note that any information you disclose on public portions of the Site, such as “comments,” may become widespread. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personally identifiable information.\nChanging Services.

You can help protect your personally identifiable information by using a combination of letters, numbers and characters in your password, changing your password often, using a secure web browser, and signing off our Site when you are finished with its use.\n\nWe take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard and deter unauthorized access to your information. When we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a credit or debit card number, we use industry standard methods to protect that information. Although we take reasonable measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of your information, no e-commerce platform, application, website, electronic database or other format or system is completely secure.\n\n9.
