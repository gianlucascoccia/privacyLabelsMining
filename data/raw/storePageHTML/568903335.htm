      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Coming up with unique passwords for the sites you visit has never been more important, but remembering them all can sometimes feel impossible. 1Password’s strength is in its simplicity: with a single master password you can secure dozens of website logins, credit card details, Wi-Fi passwords, and much more. It’s a snap to use, but offers deep levels of customization that have made it an indispensable tool for casual web surfers and power users alike.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>A safe haven for your passwords, account information, or just any valuable information for that matter. Accessed with one master password only YOU know and can remember easily, you’ll have an overview of ALL your inputed accounts or information with their respective passwords, PIN numbers, and security questions with answers. One of the great features of 1Password is that it can generate passwords for you if you so choose. You can set it up to where you can have 25 characters total with numbers and uppercase letters thrown into the mix (25 not being the max but you get the idea!) Absolutely a MUST have app for your phone if you have multiple online accounts. You ever sit there trying to get on an account you haven’t signed to in a while and you go through papers or whatever method you use to keep track of your passwords trying to desperately remember? Well look no further 1Password is here and all you got to do is open the app, type in the master password or use FaceID/TouchID, and boom! Tap on that password for the account you were just trying to access - COPY then bam! Paste that into the type bar and you’re good to go. No big deal, forget about it! Hope this review helps and honestly it really does give you peace of mind knowing you can create the most secure password with the most characters used, forget it, then simply access the app and there you have it just ready to be copied and pasted.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Yes, this app will not badger you to leave a review and that&#39;s a reflection of the outstanding professionalism of the people behind the scenes. I have never lost a single item stored with 1Password and it has saved me days of time by not having to reset a forgotten password. It has led the way since day one with the secure keychain concept and I trust it more than Apple&#39;s own late-for-the-show implementation of just a subset of what this app does with ease.<br />Now if we could establish truly secure transport encryption and authentication at websites of the caliber of this product I&#39;ll be happy. This is the best money I&#39;ve spent on any app, ever.<br />The fingerprint unlocking has been fantastic but for some reason on iOS 11.3, 1Password, and 1Password only, is not providing the fingerprint unlocking option. It says that my fingerprints have changed (they had not) and I even went to setting to redo them all and 1Password, only, gives the same message when switched to allow fingerprint unlocking and when the app is launched, it allows for the master password only. I suspect that 1Password has stricter requirements for trusting fingerprints than other apps and that this iOS update is responsible. Otherwise the app performs great as usual. <br />Even despite this I highly recommend this app and the people behind it. I fully expect the 1Password team to tell me how to fix this quickly.</p>

Today's update contains a small fix related to vault creation on 1Password.com, and just in case you missed our release notes from our big 7.4 update a few days ago, we've included them below. Thanks!\n\n\nIt’s our favorite time of year again, folks: iOS update season! We here at 1Password HQ loved the Apple Event last week where we got news of new iPhone models, an updated iPad, an all-new Apple Watch, and more. Ever since Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in June we’ve been toiling away on a fantastic batch of improvements we know you’re going to love. If you’re a “just the facts” kind of person, let’s kick it off with the headlines.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nAlongside the wonderful iOS 13 update from Apple, 1Password is here and ready with a cavalcade of new features:\n\n• Dark Mode throughout, including a new Dark Mode icon.\n• Full support for Voice Control, a brand new assistive technology introduced in iOS 13.\n• Enhanced document support with the ability to add Documents from the camera, photos, Files app, and even the new document scanner in iOS 13.\n\n\n## Dark Mode\n\nWhen Apple introduced Dark Mode on the Mac last year, we jumped at the chance to present 1Password in a whole new light (or dark, as the case may be). This year we’re turning the lights down low on 1Password for iOS as well. Once you’ve enabled the Dark appearance in the Settings app, make sure you come back to 1Password and try out our new dark app icon, configurable from Settings \u003e General \u003e Change App Icon.\n\n\n## Voice Control\n\nOne of our favorite announcements from WWDC in June was that of an all-new assistive technology that allows a person to interact naturally with their apps using just their voice. Building on our history of great accessibility, we’ve made sure that using 1Password with Voice Control is not only possible, but excellent.\n\n\n## Documents Galore\u2028\n\nWhen it comes to our Documents feature on iOS one of the consistent pieces of feedback we’ve received has been, “when are you going to allow me to add Documents to 1Password from more than just the camera roll?” Well, my friends, the time is now. With today’s update you can add Documents to 1Password from the camera roll, directly from the camera itself, and from the Files app (which includes every app that makes its files available to the Files app, such as Dropbox and Google Drive). Additionally, if you’re on iOS 13 you can use the new document scanner to add PDF scans of your paperwork to 1Password and get optical character recognition on top of it!\n\n\n## Wrapping It Up\n\nBeyond these major new features we’ve also included a tidy collection of improvements and bug fixes to boot. We hope you love this update as much as we’ve loved making it. Thank you to all our customers for your support and your feedback.

The addition of trash in 1Password for iOS is the latest example of your feedback directly driving a change. Trash has been a feature that’s been baked into 1Password for quite some time. Up until recently, though, we haven’t distinguished between deleting an item and sending it to the trash. Starting today you can move items to the trash, bring them back, or get rid of them for good by emptying the trash. \n\nThank you to everyone who got in touch and let us know this feature was important to them. We really appreciate it.\n\n## Tags\n\nWhen 1Password 7 for Mac was released last year we added a cool upgrade to our tags feature: nested tags. We’ve now brought full support for nested tags to iOS.  Nested tags allow you to up your organization: simply type a forward slash (/) when entering a tag to break it up into nested groups. Typing A/B/C will give you tag C inside B, and B inside A.\n\n## Stickers\n\nOne of the great things about working at 1Password is getting to work alongside incredibly talented, creative folks every day. One of the great things about talented, creative folks is that they love to, well, create! When our design team came to the developers and said, “We've got a whole bunch of new stickers for our sticker app” we were more than happy to oblige. Fire up Messages and check out all the new characters. Invite your friends to play a game with the gamer emoji. Tell them you’re headed to the movies with the movie-goer emoji. Let them know you’re in the mood for ice cream with the double twisty cone emoji. Who says security can’t be fun?\n\n## Full Release Notes\n\n### New\n- The Organize Tab has been renamed to Tags and now supports nested tags. {apple-issues#1110}\n- Added Trash to the Categories list!

safe haven for your passwords, account information, or just any valuable information for that matter. Accessed with one master password only YOU know and can remember easily, you’ll have an overview of ALL your inputed accounts or information with their respective passwords, PIN numbers, and security questions with answers. One of the great features of 1Password is that it can generate passwords for you if you so choose. You can set it up to where you can have 25 characters total with numbers and uppercase letters thrown into the mix (25 not being the max but you get the idea!) Absolutely a MUST have app for your phone if you have multiple online accounts. You ever sit there trying to get on an account you haven’t signed to in a while and you go through papers or whatever method you use to keep track of your passwords trying to desperately remember? Well look no further 1Password is here and all you got to do is open the app, type in the master password or use FaceID/TouchID, and boom! Tap on that password for the account you were just trying to access - COPY then bam! Paste that into the type bar and you’re good to go. No big deal, forget about it! Hope this review helps and honestly it really does give you peace of mind knowing you can create the most secure password with the most characters used, forget it, then simply access the app and there you have it just ready to be copied and pasted.","title":"Convenient, reliable, and peace of mind","userName":"VAbxman"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2157328121","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-02-02T10:50:05Z","rating":5,"review":"Yes, this app will not badger you to leave a review and that's a reflection of the outstanding professionalism of the people behind the scenes. I have never lost a single item stored with 1Password and it has saved me days of time by not having to reset a forgotten password. It has led the way since day one with the secure keychain concept and I trust it more than Apple's own late-for-the-show implementation of just a subset of what this app does with ease.\nNow if we could establish truly secure transport encryption and authentication at websites of the caliber of this product I'll be happy. This is the best money I've spent on any app, ever.\nThe fingerprint unlocking has been fantastic but for some reason on iOS 11.3, 1Password, and 1Password only, is not providing the fingerprint unlocking option. It says that my fingerprints have changed (they had not) and I even went to setting to redo them all and 1Password, only, gives the same message when switched to allow fingerprint unlocking and when the app is launched, it allows for the master password only. I suspect that 1Password has stricter requirements for trusting fingerprints than other apps and that this iOS update is responsible. Otherwise the app performs great as usual. \nEven despite this I highly recommend this app and the people behind it. I fully expect the 1Password team to tell me how to fix this quickly.","title":"Great in almost all ways","userName":"owndao"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2084764435","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-01-13T11:58:38Z","rating":5,"review":"I've had 1password since they were sold as individual licenses and from Day 1 it's been the tool I rely on most heavily in my day to day tasks. I use it to store everything I might need to access to, from passwords to passport numbers. Form filling can be a bit spotty depending on the occasion and the 1browser could use more thinking through to be truly functional, but the ease of access and security can't be beat. \n\nI've tried out most of the competition, but I keep coming back to 1P for it's UI, number of data types supported and ease of integration into my daily task flow across all my devices. Maybe it's because I'm so familiar with how 1P operates, but the competition never really struck me as in the same league. I finally bit the bullet and signed up for the subscription service, and I don't regret it one bit. My biggest complaint with the single license version was the removal of the web access functionality, but now I have it back and it's better than it's ever been before, and I have instantaneous syncing across all my platforms to boot. \n\n100% recommended to anyone that wants to stop worrying about online security and is willing to put the initial effort into migrating you're info in and filing it properly.

However, as much as I may not like that, we still have a local data store that syncs to cloud storage (I think it defaults to iCloud, but recall that there are instructions for other services). Thus, your passwords sync across all the devices that run 1Password, but it still works when one is offline. \n\nMy favorite feature is the support for one-time passwords. You no longer need dedicated Authenticator apps. Which is nice as these Authenticator apps break when you install them on a new device; as they offer no means of transferring data from one device to a new one. Now I don’t have to fix app moderated two factor authentication when I setup a new device. I dropped Google’s and Microsoft’s Authenticator apps, and just use 1Password. 1Password’s one-time password feature works just like Google’s Authenticator. Thus, you do have to reconfigure two factor authentication one last time for each account where you use that. But, that should be it. I’ll never have to do it again, unless the site or services change something that requires a change. So far, I haven’t found a service that works with Google Authenticator that doesn’t work with 1Password’s one-time password feature.","title":"Excellent.

Also I was concerned after reading some of the reviews about having to copy and paste to fill in login information. This is simply put, not the case!  I find the functionality of 1Password 7 to be as good and in many cases better than prior versions. I use 1Password on iPhone, iPad, MacBook and occasionally on work or family members PC’s. 1Password has continually improved over the years and it is significantly better and more usable on iPhone and iPad than in the past. 1Password consistently comes out with updates, fixes and improvements. After using version 7, considering a cost benefit analysis and consideration of long term dependability and development, I am definitely willing to pay the monthly or annual fee.  Please don’t rule out 1Password 7 without giving it a chance.  Also it seems clear that 1Password is committed to great customer service.

App takes playing around with after installation to get familiar initially - like anything. And after viewing the ample 1Password resources on their support site, I have created separate vaults for various categories for quick access and it is a pleasure to use the app with total piece of mind. Wonder why I hesitated for so long to use a password manager despite having read several experts recommending using one. After detailed reviews of several of the top password managers on the market (free and paid ones), it was a pretty simple choice for me to go with 1Password Manager and I am very happy with my choice. Works flawlessly every single time and syncs with all my devices in real time 😃. So far, I have had NO issues and I can recommend it highly to anyone considering getting one.","title":"Intuitive, Simple, Flexible yet Secure😅","userName":"Baba D NJ"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5899521149","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-05-04T00:26:18Z","rating":5,"review":"I have tried other password saving apps and I have to say, this one is the best one for your money. I got the free app before they started offering pay options. Every site you go to, or app you use, makes you create an account these days and it can be overwhelming to have so many passwords and logins. This app allows you to create different logins and passwords for each one of them without the fear of forgetting them and having to go through the agony of retrieving passwords or recreating accounts. It enables you to have better security as well because you are not using the same login and password for every site you use because you can just add it to this app and forget it. Now it’s there when you need it again. The only thing I would suggest to the developers is, make a setting for the user to define what “home page” the app opens to. Meaning instead of opening to the standard page the app opens with, I could have the app open to a specific vault or page. I only use the app for passwords and logins so I would love to go straight there. It’s nit picky but, other than that, this app is great. Others either do not have the same functionality or make you sign up for things or charge you for what you get here for free. 👍🏼","title":"Best Password app available!!!","userName":"Nisoplexis"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1801294290","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2017-09-21T05:48:05Z","rating":5,"review":"I first got this app to generate new passwords, but this has become so much more. My entire life is being protected by this app. As I got older, even before that, there was no way I was going to remember the sheer voluminous number of passwords I was being required to use. Work, Bank accounts, Financial and retirement funds, online vendors. It started slow but as I found out how easy it was to use and how much more I could lock away (Driver licenses, social security accounts, and data for everyone in my family down to the last grandchild), I found my whole life is detailed in this one app. With the  Equifax debacle possibly exposing us to what could be more information stolen than I could of imagined, I realized everything they had and more could be found in 1Password. So I wrote support for advice, but found in their webnotes that I'm safer on every level than I could have hoped for. Its like this team put all their own lives in here and said let's build a fort, then built a fort around that, and so on. The only way anyine is getting into this app and my information, is by finding where I have my Master Password hidden just in case.\nI know this review is too long, and I'm gushing, but again after Equifax, at last I can believe in something.","title":"Everything You Need","userName":"Kening"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4891151609","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-10-05T12:39:53Z","rating":5,"review":"1Password should be required for you to get a license to use the internet. If this were true most internet security problems would disappear. But it only works if you use it and use it properly. I’ve had a family account for about 5 years and this app completely secures both my business and personal life. I can’t say I use it daily, because I use it hourly. \n\nI read through some of the one star reviews to try and understand why someone would do that to 1Password. Looks to me that most were at fault for their own problems. 1Password can’t reset your password if you forget it, they don’t have it it’s YOUR password. And why on earth would they let you set the mobile app to be unlocked until the next time the phone is powered off? That’s insane! Your phone is the most public facing and easily stolen device you have. Oops! Someone just got access to ALL your passwords.\n\nYou can’t fix stupid but I think 1Password is doing a pretty good job at securing its users precious information despite the users best efforts to the contrary. If you take password security seriously (as you should) purchase a subscription to 1Password, you won’t be disappointed.","title":"You must have 1Password to use the internet","userName":"ductmonkey"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1932971249","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2017-11-19T17:33:40Z","rating":1,"review":"I hate to give bad ratings, but...I paid around $50 (yes!) to be able to access on pc and Mac and iOS. I have stuck with it because starting over would be a drag. But really...the functionality of this app is awful. You’re trying to add “notes” and the box won’t open (it keeps dropping down where you can’t get to it). If you don’t fill a sufficient # of boxes on a new entry it won’t let you save it. If you have a problem with accessing from another device or moving to a new device you end up with back and forth emails that go something like this “Hi. We love you. Update all of your devices and assemble them all in the same location and then email us back.” They just keep kicking the can back to you (no phone support). It’s unbelievably annoying. I just don’t even bother anymore. I just open and start a new password and put everything in the notes section (when I can get it to work-if you save and re-open it usually works the second time). And if you select the option to use your fingertip to open, it shows up on the screen and you have to tap that and THEN hit the home button. You can’t just go right to it. And sometimes it just randomly requires you to enter the actual password. I actually have my last two iPhones in a drawer because I’m terrified my passwords didn’t all move to the new device and I’ll be in trouble. Seriously, it shows I have like 314 passwords on the iPad version of the app and 322 in the iPhone version.

In particular we fixed an issue where the floating keyboard on iPadOS was causing the lock screen to stick around when it should have disappeared, and we fixed an issue that would cause 1Password to freeze and fail when using Password AutoFill.\n\nHere’s the full set of changes:\n\n## New\n\n• You can now convert a generated Password item into a Login item. {#3289}\n\n## Improved\n\n• Improved accessibility for users with a non-default font size.\n• Improved the on-boarding experience for users with smaller screens. {#4246}\n• You can now copy account information from the account settings screen in Settings \u003e 1Password Accounts \u003e [your account]. {#2170}\n• Creating vaults is now more fault tolerant. {#4247}\n• Added a \"done\" button in the keyboard when creating new vaults. {#4312}\n• Improved QR Code generation for better compatibility between platforms. {#4299}\n\n## Fixed\n\n• Fixed a crash that could occur when using Password AutoFill with standalone vaults. {#4280,#4271}\n• Fixed an issue where the app would fail to unlock when using a floating keyboard on iPad. {#3906, #4248}\n• Fixed an issue that prevented swipe to pop from working in the category list. {#4208}\n• Large Type text now has appropriate contrast when \"Reduce Transparency\" is enabled. {#4232}\n• Fixed an issue that prevented certain buttons from being visible on light backgrounds. {#4267}\n• Fixed an issue where some notes items in the item list would be cut off. {#4279}\n• Fixed a crash that could happen with In-App Purchases {#4253}\n• Fixed a crash that might happen after a failed vault migration. {#4265}\n\n## Security\n\n• Suspended users do not see their favorite items anymore. {#4240}\n\n\n1Password never prompts you for a review because we value your workflow too much to interrupt it.

Today's update contains a small fix related to vault creation on 1Password.com, and just in case you missed our release notes from our big 7.4 update a few days ago, we've included them below. Thanks!\n\n\nIt’s our favorite time of year again, folks: iOS update season! We here at 1Password HQ loved the Apple Event last week where we got news of new iPhone models, an updated iPad, an all-new Apple Watch, and more. Ever since Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in June we’ve been toiling away on a fantastic batch of improvements we know you’re going to love. If you’re a “just the facts” kind of person, let’s kick it off with the headlines.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nAlongside the wonderful iOS 13 update from Apple, 1Password is here and ready with a cavalcade of new features:\n\n• Dark Mode throughout, including a new Dark Mode icon.\n• Full support for Voice Control, a brand new assistive technology introduced in iOS 13.\n• Enhanced document support with the ability to add Documents from the camera, photos, Files app, and even the new document scanner in iOS 13.\n\n\n## Dark Mode\n\nWhen Apple introduced Dark Mode on the Mac last year, we jumped at the chance to present 1Password in a whole new light (or dark, as the case may be). This year we’re turning the lights down low on 1Password for iOS as well. Once you’ve enabled the Dark appearance in the Settings app, make sure you come back to 1Password and try out our new dark app icon, configurable from Settings \u003e General \u003e Change App Icon.\n\n\n## Voice Control\n\nOne of our favorite announcements from WWDC in June was that of an all-new assistive technology that allows a person to interact naturally with their apps using just their voice. Building on our history of great accessibility, we’ve made sure that using 1Password with Voice Control is not only possible, but excellent.\n\n\n## Documents Galore\u2028\n\nWhen it comes to our Documents feature on iOS one of the consistent pieces of feedback we’ve received has been, “when are you going to allow me to add Documents to 1Password from more than just the camera roll?” Well, my friends, the time is now. With today’s update you can add Documents to 1Password from the camera roll, directly from the camera itself, and from the Files app (which includes every app that makes its files available to the Files app, such as Dropbox and Google Drive). Additionally, if you’re on iOS 13 you can use the new document scanner to add PDF scans of your paperwork to 1Password and get optical character recognition on top of it!\n\n\n## Wrapping It Up\n\nBeyond these major new features we’ve also included a tidy collection of improvements and bug fixes to boot. We hope you love this update as much as we’ve loved making it. Thank you to all our customers for your support and your feedback. I know we say it often, but that doesn’t make it any less true.\n\n1Password never prompts you for a review because we value your workflow too much to interrupt it. If you feel generous and have a couple of minutes, please leave a review. It makes a huge difference to us. Thank you in advance. \u003c3\n\nIf you need us you can find us at @1Password on Twitter.

Because our iOS and Mac products share so much of their underpinnings, you’re actually getting some of the new features we’ve been working on for an upcoming update to 1Password for Mac before they launch there!\n\n### New\n\n- You can now select an account in the vault switcher menu to see every item across all the vaults in that account. We’ve been loving this feature to keep work and home accounts separate, or to quickly find an item you know exists in a vault _somewhere_. {#425}\n- Updated to the latest and greatest web page filling brain.\n\n### Improved\n\n- Improved performance when setting up standalone vault syncing. {#3646}\n- Quick Copy for credit cards now follows this order Card Number \u003e Expiration Date \u003e CVV. {#3526}\n- When migrating attachments to Documents, the item name from the attachment is now prepended to the Document name.\n- Updated the descriptions of Watchtower used throughout 1Password. {#3405}\n- Provide a clearer description when you try to access an account that has been suspended. {#3378}\n- While editing an item, the keyboard now hides when showing a menu. {#3376}\n- You can now toggle an account's vaults inclusion in All Vaults all at once. {#3598}\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an issue that would cause a failure to generate a two factor code if its secret or URL contained invalid characters. {#3163}\n- Fixed a crash that could occur in the Password AutoFill extension. {#3655}\n- Fixed a crash that could happen when downloading a Document that was incorrectly uploaded without a name. {#3370}\n- Fixed a bug that could cause 1Password to hang momentarily at start-up.\n- Fixed a crash that could occur in certain situations when attempting to add an account.\n- Fixed issue where 1Password would lock immediately after setting up a new account. {#3565}\n- You can no longer favorite, move, copy, or add to Apple Watch when viewing trashed items. {#3431}\n- Item counts in All Vaults will now display correctly when suspended accounts are present.\n- Fixed an issue that could prevent the contents of All Vaults from loading immediately after setup. {#896}\n- Watchtower now assumes credit cards expire at the end of the expiry month. {#3282}\n- Fixed an issue with corporate firewalls terminating the 1Password.com notifier connection due to lack of communication.\n- The option to enable Spotlight search only appears for paid customers. {#3524}\n- Text is no longer truncated on the Pro Features screen when using enlarged font. {#3380}\n- Fixed an issue where item modification dates were updated without editing the item. {#266}\n- Fixed a rare crash that could occur when editing websites on an item. {#3530}\n- Fixed a crash that could occur when an address contained bad data. {#3555}\n- Fixed a crash that could occur when failing to decrypt an item. {#3392}\n- Fixed an issue where invalid cache files were not being removed. {#3335}\n- Fixed an issue when loading malformed item. {#3522}\n\n### Security\n\n- Information copied via 3D Touch now properly sets its expiry on the pasteboard.\n- Fixed an issue where in some cases Travel Mode would leave items in memory until next lock. {#3650}\n- Fixed an issue that allowed drag and drop when it should have been disallowed by the permissions on a vault. {#3556}\n\n\n1Password never prompts you for a review because we value your workflow too much to interrupt it.

Today’s update is all about bringing a little more feature parity between 1Password for Mac and 1Password for iOS. Starting today you’ll be able to access (and empty) the trash as well as organize your items better using nested tags. We’ve also added a whole new collection of stickers to our sticker pack, just for fun.\n\n## Trash\n\nIf you ever take the time to look back through the myriad release notes from 1Password updates of the past you’ll start to see a theme: us thanking you for your input and for helping us make 1Password better. This isn’t a throwaway line, it’s a guiding principle we use as we tackle new features, improvements, and bug fixes. The addition of trash in 1Password for iOS is the latest example of your feedback directly driving a change. Trash has been a feature that’s been baked into 1Password for quite some time. Up until recently, though, we haven’t distinguished between deleting an item and sending it to the trash. Starting today you can move items to the trash, bring them back, or get rid of them for good by emptying the trash. \n\nThank you to everyone who got in touch and let us know this feature was important to them. We really appreciate it.\n\n## Tags\n\nWhen 1Password 7 for Mac was released last year we added a cool upgrade to our tags feature: nested tags. We’ve now brought full support for nested tags to iOS.  Nested tags allow you to up your organization: simply type a forward slash (/) when entering a tag to break it up into nested groups. Typing A/B/C will give you tag C inside B, and B inside A.\n\n## Stickers\n\nOne of the great things about working at 1Password is getting to work alongside incredibly talented, creative folks every day. One of the great things about talented, creative folks is that they love to, well, create! When our design team came to the developers and said, “We've got a whole bunch of new stickers for our sticker app” we were more than happy to oblige. Fire up Messages and check out all the new characters. Invite your friends to play a game with the gamer emoji. Tell them you’re headed to the movies with the movie-goer emoji. Let them know you’re in the mood for ice cream with the double twisty cone emoji. Who says security can’t be fun?\n\n## Full Release Notes\n\n### New\n- The Organize Tab has been renamed to Tags and now supports nested tags. {apple-issues#1110}\n- Added Trash to the Categories list! You can view and restore trashed items, or simply empty the trash for the fresh and clean feeling. {apple-issues#2085}\n- Additional stickers have been added to the 1Password sticker collection!\n\n### Improved\n- Improved the workflow when signing into accounts that require multi-factor authentication (MFA). {apple-issues#3311}\n- Creating a login in the Password AutoFill extension will post a notification if the app must be open to sync the new login. {apple-issues#3039}\n- Titles for new items are now capitalized by default.
