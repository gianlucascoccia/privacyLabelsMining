      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Thanks for making BrainWave the Top-Ranked Binaural App for 11 years! * This update improves the iTunes integration and Accessibility * Headphones/Earbuds are required for Binaural Tones to be Effective * Affordable One-time purchase with No Subscriptions or In-App Purchases * Combine Advanced Multi-stage Binaural Programs with 5 Background Audio Modes: Ambience, Other App, Ambience + Other App, iTunes, iTunes + Ambience * Includes UI for iPhone &amp; iPad * Supports Family Share &amp; iOS 13 Dark Mode<br />* Combine Brainwaves with Ambience and Another App by selecting background mode &#39;Ambience + Other App&#39; * To use Another App for the Background Audio choose &#39;Other App&#39;. <br />* Added the ability to play and pause audio using Lock Screen and Remote Controls only when using Brainwaves with the included Ambience. <br />* When using background modes that allow other audio apps or iTunes Music to be playing Lockscreen controls will only affect iTunes or the other app.<br />* If the audio stops when the app is backgrounded or the screen locks please restart the device with a full shutdown as this is the result of low RAM memory which causes iOS to suspend background audio.<br /><br />* How it Works *<br /><br />During the entrainment process, two different carrier tones are played into the left and right ears. The frequency difference between these tones matches the brainwave frequency of the target state of mind. The listener will hear these carrier tones as an audible tone, however, when processing these two different tones the human brain will perceive the small frequency difference between the tones as an inaudible periodic beat. When exposed to this beat the listener&#39;s brainwaves will begin to synchronize with the beat frequency. What allows the human brain to perceive this beat is our directional hearing system, located in the brain stem. The brain&#39;s directional hearing system calculates frequency shifts between sound entering the left and right ear to quickly locate the direction of a sound, but when that difference is rhythmic, as with binaural tones, the brain synchronizes with the pattern. This process is more effective in the presence of background noise or ambience, which allows humans to hear and locate even subtle sounds, like an animal moving nearby in a forest that is filled with noise.<br /><br />As an example, the human ear can&#39;t directly perceive the .5 - 2 Hz Delta-wave frequencies associated with deep sleep because it is well below the human hearing range, but if you wear headphones or earbuds with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 136 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 1 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat, in this case matching a low delta wave frequency associated with sleep. As you listen, your own brainwaves will begin to match that frequency.<br /><br />* Brainwave Frequencies *<br /><br />Gamma waves (30-44 Hz):<br />Associated with high-level information processing, multi-tasking, excitement, and high energy.<br /><br />High-Beta waves (18-29 Hz):<br />Associated with mental activities such as math, planning, and design.<br /><br />Mid-Beta waves (15-17 Hz):<br />Increased problem-solving ability, focus, and alertness.<br /><br />Low-Beta waves (12-14 Hz):<br />Relaxed, yet still mentally sharp<br /><br />High-Alpha waves (10-11 Hz):<br />Relaxed, centered, tranquil<br /><br />Low-Alpha waves (8-9 Hz):<br />Relaxed, almost meditative but still aware<br /><br />Theta waves (4-7 Hz):<br />Associated with deep meditation, creativity, intuition, and dream-like states. Theta waves also occur during REM sleep and the early stages of deep, slow-wave sleep.<br /><br />Delta waves (.5-3 Hz):<br />Deep, slow-wave sleep. Slow-wave sleep allows the brain to recover from daily activities. It is important for hormonal regulation, growth, memory retention, and physical renewal.<br /><br />Warning: Do not use BrainWave while driving or operating machinery.<br />Note: If your vehicle Auto-Plays connected devices use the Ambience+Other background mode, not Ambience-Only, to prevent Lockscreen access.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I&#39;ve had this app on my phone for sometime, with the intention of using it as an aid for parasympathetic body work.  I finally started using it yesterday.  I&#39;ve been listening to it now for a few hours (Deep Relaxation with Peace background), and so far I&#39;m impressed with how well it works.  <br /><br />I typically feel overwhelmed by the numerous things that need to be accomplished, which leaves me feeling anxious and rushed.  This particular combo has really helped me to slow down today and not feel so uptight, which sadly, is not easily accomplished.  I use other modalities to shift my body into parasympathetic mode, but I can&#39;t seem to stay there. This program seems to be helping dampen down triggers that cause my body to shift into sympathetic state inappropriately.<br /><br />I look forward to trying the other programs.  I hope the results are as impressive and useful.  Even if they aren&#39;t, the results I&#39;m experiencing today made downloading this app one of the best tools I&#39;ve acquired to step away from the perpetual, health destroying, running myself ragged mindset that our culture has ingrained in us.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This thing blows my mind! The first time I used it I was like &quot;No way!&quot; As I kept using it I discovered that it is literally the only way I am able to fall asleep nights when my mind is so full of thoughts and my anxiety is running rampant! I hate the way sleep aids make me feel like I&#39;ve been run over by a freight train. I recently switched from using &quot;Deep Sleep&quot; to &quot;Dreamy Sleep&quot; and had the craziest dreams! I normally can&#39;t remember my dreams and I was actually able to recall quite a bit of them. Unfortunately last night, I dreamt that I faked the death of my dog last year and I felt like it lasted the whole night so I think I&#39;ll be switching back to &quot;Deep Sleep&quot; :( Awesome product though. My *only* complaint is that I wish there were more ambiance options or the ability to use it with Pandora. You can use your own music but I don&#39;t have much personal music on my phone so I am limited to using the app&#39;s ambiance tracks and they get old after a while. Highly recommend!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I use this all the time. It is great to get to sleep when suffering with insomnia, pain relief for fibromyalgia or migraine, force a nap when you know you will need it but can’t stop thinking, jet lag wake or sleep, tinnitus, energy meditation (ahhmaaazzzing!!!), or just quiet your ADD when you need to focus. SO MANY USES!!<br /><br />I love the ambient noise that comes with the app- especially ocean waves. Love that you can use itunes, but usually don’t find it necessary. I also love the slick looking super-intuitive dashboard.<br /><br />The only improvement it is needs better control on fade in/fade out during programs and at the end of programs. I have the fade toggles set, and only use the app’s ambient sounds,  but they are not always working properly. The abrupt stop and start is especially jarring when you are attempting deep sleep- similar to vertigo feeling as you are just falling asleep and you jump suddenly, but without the physical jump- lol. Also integrated glossary within descriptions would be awesome, eg, why gamma for this particular program or beta for that one? What does it DO? Talk nerdy to me.</p>

stops when the app is backgrounded or the screen locks please restart the device with a full shutdown as this is the result of low RAM memory which causes iOS to suspend background audio.\n\n* How it Works *\n\nDuring the entrainment process, two different carrier tones are played into the left and right ears. The frequency difference between these tones matches the brainwave frequency of the target state of mind. The listener will hear these carrier tones as an audible tone, however, when processing these two different tones the human brain will perceive the small frequency difference between the tones as an inaudible periodic beat. When exposed to this beat the listener's brainwaves will begin to synchronize with the beat frequency. What allows the human brain to perceive this beat is our directional hearing system, located in the brain stem. The brain's directional hearing system calculates frequency shifts between sound entering the left and right ear to quickly locate the direction of a sound, but when that difference is rhythmic, as with binaural tones, the brain synchronizes with the pattern. This process is more effective in the presence of background noise or ambience, which allows humans to hear and locate even subtle sounds, like an animal moving nearby in a forest that is filled with noise.\n\nAs an example, the human ear can't directly perceive the .5 - 2 Hz Delta-wave frequencies associated with deep sleep because it is well below the human hearing range, but if you wear headphones or earbuds with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 136 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 1 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat, in this case matching a low delta wave frequency associated with sleep. As you listen, your own brainwaves will begin to match that frequency.\n\n* Brainwave Frequencies *\n\nGamma waves (30-44 Hz):\nAssociated with high-level information processing, multi-tasking, excitement, and high energy.\n\nHigh-Beta waves (18-29 Hz):\nAssociated with mental activities such as math, planning, and design.\n\nMid-Beta waves (15-17 Hz):\nIncreased problem-solving ability, focus, and alertness.\n\nLow-Beta waves (12-14 Hz):\nRelaxed, yet still mentally sharp\n\nHigh-Alpha waves (10-11 Hz):\nRelaxed, centered, tranquil\n\nLow-Alpha waves (8-9 Hz):\nRelaxed, almost meditative but still aware\n\nTheta waves (4-7 Hz):\nAssociated with deep meditation, creativity, intuition, and dream-like states. Theta waves also occur during REM sleep and the early stages of deep, slow-wave sleep.\n\nDelta waves (.5-3 Hz):\nDeep, slow-wave sleep. Slow-wave sleep allows the brain to recover from daily activities. It is important for hormonal regulation, growth, memory retention, and physical renewal.\n\nWarning: Do not use BrainWave while driving or operating machinery.\nNote: If your vehicle Auto-Plays connected devices use the Ambience+Other background mode, not Ambience-Only, to prevent Lockscreen access.","releaseDate":"2020-06-22"},{"versionDisplay":"8.1.4","releaseNotes":"Thanks for making BrainWave the Top-Selling Brainwave Entrainment App for 11 years!

In modes that allow other audio apps or iTunes Music to be playing these controls will only affect iTunes or the other app. This is because in modes where our app allows other audio to play that other app becomes the \"Now Playing\" app--and there can be only one \"Now Playing\" app on iOS.\n\n* How it Works *\nDuring the entrainment process, two different carrier tones are played into the left and right ears. The frequency difference between these tones matches the brainwave frequency of the target state of mind. The listener will hear these carrier tones as an audible tone, however, when processing these two different tones the human brain will perceive the small frequency difference between the tones as an inaudible periodic beat. When exposed to this beat the listener's brainwaves will begin to synchronize with the beat frequency. What allows the human brain to perceive this beat is our directional hearing system, located in the brain stem. The brain's directional hearing system calculates frequency shifts between sound entering the left and right ear to quickly locate the direction of a sound, but when that difference is rhythmic, as with binaural tones, the brain synchronizes with the pattern. This process is more effective in the presence of background noise or ambient sounds, which allows humans to hear and locate even subtle sounds, like an animal moving nearby in a forest that is filled with noise. It is also what allows humans to perceive the beat frequency produced by tuning forks.\n\nAs an example, the human ear can't directly perceive the .5 - 2 Hz Delta-wave frequencies associated with deep sleep because it is well below the human hearing range, but if you wear headphones or earbuds with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 136 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 1 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat, in this case matching a low delta wave frequency associated with sleep. As you listen, your own brainwaves will begin to match that frequency.\n\n* Brainwave Frequencies *\nDifferent states of mind will display a dominant frequency, but all brainwaves are present in a mix at all times.\n\nGamma waves (30-44 Hz):\nAssociated with high-level information processing, multi-tasking, excitement, and high energy.\n\nHigh-Beta waves (18-29 Hz):\nAssociated with mental activities such as math, planning, and design.\n\nMid-Beta waves (15-17 Hz):\nIncreased problem-solving ability, focus, and alertness.\n\nLow-Beta waves (12-14 Hz):\nRelaxed, yet still mentally sharp\n\nHigh-Alpha waves (10-11 Hz):\nRelaxed, centered, tranquil\n\nLow-Alpha waves (8-9 Hz):\nRelaxed, almost meditative but still aware\n\nTheta waves (4-7 Hz):\nAssociated with deep meditation, creativity, intuition, and dream-like states.

These frequencies can be induced in the brain by playing two different tones into each ear (binaural tones), which after being processed by the brain, are perceived as an inaudible binaural beat matching the target brainwave frequency. As you listen, your own brainwaves fall into step and synchronize with this frequency. \n\n* 35 Brainwave Entrainment Programs *\n\nBrainWave uses low, mid, and high frequency ranges of Delta, Theta,

different audible frequencies to each ear, which, after being processed by the brain, are perceived as an inaudible low-frequency beat matching the target brainwave frequency.  Various states of mind are associated with different inaudible brainwave frequencies, ranging from an alert and focused state of mind to deeply relaxed, all the way to deep sleep. Our BrainWave apps recreate these frequencies using the most advanced multi-stage binaural sequences available, allowing your mind you to relax and synchronize with your desired state.  It achieves this using our unique process called Progressive Brainwave Entrainment.\n\n*** Progressive Brainwave Entrainment ***\n\n - Composite Binaural Frequencies that stimulate multiple brainwave frequencies are used to create combination experiences.\n\n - Progressive Brainwave Programs - Each program goes through a progression of brainwaves, each for a specific period of time sufficient to synchronize your brainwaves with the binaural tones.  This ensures a more effective brainwave entrainment experience.\n\n*** Apps in this Discounted Bundle ***\n\nBrainWave - 35 Advanced Binaural Programs - Our top selling app featuring a broad range of programs from Focus and Memory to Meditation and Sleep.  Has some limited overlap with the other apps below, which each dive deeper into specific areas such as Dreaming, Mental Performance, Meditation and Physical Performance.\n\nAltered States - 21 Binaural Programs designed to stimulate deeply meditative and relaxed states of mind.\n\nSharp Mind - 16 Binaural Programs designed to stimulate specific cognitive states related to Problem Solving,

sleep sequences.\n\nNeural Athletic Trainer - 7 Programs designed to improve performance by enhancing Reflex Response, Mental Endurance and Focus.\n\n*** App Features ***\n\n - 86 advanced binaural programs across the 5 Top Selling Binaural Apps to use throughout the day.\n\n - Advanced multi-stage binaural sequences to take your mind through a series of binaural frequencies to achieve your desired state of mind.\n\n - Multiple program durations (10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours)\n\n - Use one of the 17 included Ambient Backgrounds or create a

had this app on my phone for sometime, with the intention of using it as an aid for parasympathetic body work.  I finally started using it yesterday.  I've been listening to it now for a few hours (Deep Relaxation with Peace background), and so far I'm impressed with how well it works.  \n\nI typically feel overwhelmed by the numerous things that need to be accomplished, which leaves me feeling anxious and rushed.  This particular combo has really helped me to slow down today and not feel so uptight, which sadly, is not easily accomplished.  I use other modalities to shift my body into parasympathetic mode, but I can't seem to stay there. This program seems to be helping dampen down triggers that cause my body to shift into sympathetic state inappropriately.\n\nI look forward to trying the other programs.  I hope the results are as impressive and useful.  Even if they aren't, the results I'm experiencing today made downloading this app one of the best tools I've acquired to step away from the perpetual, health destroying, running myself ragged mindset that our culture has ingrained in us.","title":"I'll Be Using This App Often.","userName":"ddp1966"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1359655779","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2016-04-07T03:02:23Z","rating":5,"review":"This thing blows my mind! The first time I used it I was like \"No way!\" As I kept using it I discovered that it is literally the only way I am able to fall asleep nights when my mind is so full of thoughts and my anxiety is running rampant! I hate the way sleep aids make me feel like I've been run over by a freight train. I recently switched from using \"Deep Sleep\" to \"Dreamy Sleep\" and had the craziest dreams! I normally can't remember my dreams and I was actually able to recall quite a bit of them. Unfortunately last night, I dreamt that I faked the death of my dog last year and I felt like it lasted the whole night so I think I'll be switching back to \"Deep Sleep\" :( Awesome product though. My *only* complaint is that I wish there were more ambiance options or the ability to use it with Pandora.

It is great to get to sleep when suffering with insomnia, pain relief for fibromyalgia or migraine, force a nap when you know you will need it but can’t stop thinking, jet lag wake or sleep, tinnitus, energy meditation (ahhmaaazzzing!!!), or just quiet your ADD when you need to focus. SO MANY USES!!\n\nI love the ambient noise that comes with the app- especially ocean waves. Love that you can use itunes, but usually don’t find it necessary. I also love the slick looking super-intuitive dashboard.\n\nThe only improvement it is needs better control on fade in/fade out during programs and at the end of programs. I have the fade toggles set, and only use the app’s ambient sounds,  but they are not always working properly. The abrupt stop and start is especially jarring when you are attempting deep sleep- similar to vertigo feeling as you are just falling asleep and you jump suddenly, but without the physical jump- lol. Also integrated glossary within descriptions would be awesome, eg, why gamma for this particular program or beta for that one? What does it DO?

I also wanted to sleep better.   I purchased Brain Wave,  Mind Tuner, Perfect Sleep, Tranquil Mind, Brain Beats, MyCalmBeat, Perfect Sleep, Deep Sleep, and My Meditation.  I tried them all and, to some extent, they all work.\nHowever, Brain Wave, Tranquil Mind and Perfect Sleep are, by far, the best for me.  Banzai Labs has done a good job.  You can select any of a variety of binaural applications from Morning Coffee straight through 20 routines to Deep Sleep.  I tried Power Nap for 20 minutes and dozed off.  However, instead of being a little groggy or spaced when I awoke, I was alert and oriented. \nYou can also select a background ambient noise and the sound level.  Unlike all of the other programs, you can select how long you want it to run.\nI now meditate every morning and Brain Wave and Mind Tuner have been reliable and helpful.\n\nPerfect Sleep has been very effective.  I have been getting up twice or three times a night and sometimes it difficult to fall back to sleep.  Now I listen to Deep Sleep for 15 minutes, take it off when it's done and immediately fall asleep and stay asleep for at least 3-4 hours.  If I awaken, I easily go back to sleep. \n\nAlthough I like Deep Sleep, the hypnosis simply is not as effective for me as the binaural beats of Perfect Sleep.","title":"It works really well but it's not your guru or ambien","userName":"lucky bsharit"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1281263062","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2015-11-03T07:37:49Z","rating":5,"review":"Big warning: This app won't cure your neuralgia, nor will make your psychosis or psychosomatic illnesses go away.  Binaural beats are Not drugs. Want a quicker way? Take a pill. Don't want to use pills? Then take a walk. Too lazy ? Then just take very slow and deep breaths, and stay away from your cellphone.\nSeriously, I read a bunch of people complaining about this app sucking just cause it didn't get rid of their migraines the first time they tried it. How unfair is that? \n\nThis app has some beats that do their intended work quite well. Like the sleep/wake up beats.  I'm trying the lucid dreaming from one of their sister apps and I can tell you so far I haven't been able to have any lucid dreaming HOWEVER, I start dreaming even BEFIRE completely falling asleep.\n\nFor example, just yesterday I was falling asleep when my roommate entered my room to look for some shoes and I remember quite clearly seeing her standing next to my bed asking me about the shoes and at the SAME time, I was seeing a dream overlapping my reality.  Like two things happening at the same time in the same space.\nI don't know if this was the result of listening to the beats but I'm really looking forward to something similar happening cause there is nothing cooler than to be talking half asleep to somebody and at the same time seeing how and old carriage goes across that person like a ghost.","title":"GREAT APP .

There were no adverse effects, so I thought I had nothing to lose. \n\nThis seems to work for me. Works well for anger issues, increasing positive attitude, and helping induce relaxation before bedtime. Placebo effect is powerful, and that could definitely be at play here. But that’s fine with me since the app is relatively cheap and I’ve got nothing to lose. \n\nJust please note that I DO have anxiety and I work continuously with mental health professionals to care for myself. I also exercise, eat well, and practice all self care that’s recommended. This is NOT a cure all. This definitely would NOT work on its own, not for me. But, as a part of a whole, it is helpful.","title":"Maybe Placebo, Definitely Don’t Care","userName":"Lilikeepsitreal"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1889737849","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2017-11-01T12:16:56Z","rating":5,"review":"ADHD is a problem that I address daily, resisting distractions and focusing on the task at the top of my prioritized, daily to-do list. It’s not always easy, especially when tired. What I now know for sure is that BrainWave makes it easier. It also gives me hope, not in the same way that prayer does, but alongside it. The obstacles including Cochlear implants and pain management are less of a burden.\n\nI found out about the concept from a very dear 85 year old friend friend, who is remarkably regaining his mental and physical strength, much like he was 10 years ago. I have found out about other treatment programs, but this one is immediate, easy, and enjoyable. \n\nLove all the different programs. Although I’ve been working out for years, this is the first time I’ve been able to “exercise” my mental and intellectual capacity.

When I am at dance practice and need something to play that will keep everyone out and help my focus as I study off-stage, the rain works as white noise. Furthermore, I have been using it as a Pomodoro timer during my long study sessions - 30 minutes on Focus and Alert, ending with an alarm to signal to start my 10-minute \"break\" in which I answer emails or do some online shopping. I also use it as my napping buddy in the library, where I cannot use my phone or intrinsic iPad alarm for fear it will go off through the speaker and not my headphones.

I have OSA and use a CPAP, honestly the only benefit I get from is it that I don't snore with it. My sleep pattern is still just as jacked up as it always has been. I'm super restless at night, I wake up several times a night. It's a pattern that I'm pretty much used to. \n\nThe other day I ran across a video on YT about Binaural Beats. I thought it was kind of interesting so I did a bit of research. One thing I am obsessed with is tracking my vitals. I use the Apple Watch to track all sorts of metrics while I sleep. Now here's what I have seen so far.\n\nMy first night I used this app I used ear buds because they fit better with my CPAP, 4:20 minutes is all the sleep I got. Which is pretty typical for me. Here's the kicker. I was restless twice, once at the beginning as I fell asleep and once right before I woke up. My heart rate dipped 21% which it has never done while sleeping. 12% was my Max before this. \n\nNow am I saying that this is a cure-all? No, did this Binaural beat have some effect on my brainwaves last night? It's looking that way, So far I am impressed. I will continue to use this, track my results and rate a 5 if all goes well. Regardless, best $5 I have spent in a while.","title":"Impressed

shared!\n\nDifferent states of mind are associated with specific brainwave frequencies that would be inaudible if played directly. These frequencies can be induced in the brain by playing two different tones into each ear (binaural tones), which after being processed by the brain, are perceived as an inaudible binaural beat matching the target brainwave frequency. As you listen, your own brainwaves fall into step and synchronize with this frequency. \n\n* 35 Brainwave Entrainment Programs *\n\nBrainWave uses low, mid, and high frequency ranges of Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma binaural tones combined in layers and stages to create powerful multi-stage experiences.\n\n- Morning Coffee: Gentle Alpha \u0026 Beta waves to start the day\n- Espresso Shot: Energizing Binaural High Beta and Gamma\n- Morning Meditation: Alpha and Theta for a centered mind\n- Focused and Alert: High-Beta/High-Gamma to maximize focus\n- Critical Thinking: Theta/Mid-Beta Blend to boost logical thinking\n- Concentration: Mid-Beta Binaural tones for steady concentration\n- Memory Boost: Beta Spectrum Mix to improve memory\n- Problem Solving: Alpha,Theta/High-Beta for focus and creative problem solving\n- Brainstorm: High Beta to boost lateral thinking.\n- Confidence Boost: Alpha, Beta, High-Theta Mix to boost confidence\n- Pre-Exercise Energy: High-Gamma tones for quick energy\n- Creativity Boost: Increase creativity with Mid-Theta Binaural beats\n- Positive Mood Boost: Low-Theta/High-Theta tones for positive thinking\n- Motivation Boost: High-Alpha/High-Beta blend to increase motivation\n- Euphoria: High-Theta, Beta, and Gamma to stimulate joy\n- Stress Reduction: Mid-Alpha/Theta Mix\n- Anger Relief: Mid-Delta/Alpha\n- Calm Reflection: Mid-Theta \n- Reduce Anxiety: Deeply calming Theta spectrum\n- Deep Relaxation: Relaxing Low-Theta, Delta\n- Meditation: Complex Alpha, Beta and Theta progression\n- Lucid Dreaming: Experience waking dreams\n- Dreamy Sleep: Delta/Theta Mix for deep sleep and dreams\n- Power Nap: Restful nap with a wakeup stage for mental focus\n- Deep Sleep: Low Delta wave sleep, effective for insomnia\n- Deep Sleep with Wake-up Stage: Deep Delta for insomnia with wakeup\n- Dreamy Sleep with Wake-up Stage: Delta/Beta\n- Headache Relief: Relieve headaches with Low-Alpha/Theta/Delta\n- Hangover Relief: Delta/Theta\n- Yoga Meditation: Centering High-Alpha/Theta\n- Alpha Relaxation: Calming Binaural Alpha\n- Theta Meditation: Pure Theta for Deep meditation\n- Gamma Power Nap: Extra energizing power nap with Gamma waking tones\n- Night Meditation: Low-Theta/Delta to meditate before bed\n- Night Reading: High-Delta/High-Theta for late reading\n\n* Backgrounds *\n\n- Beach Surf\n- Ocean Waves \n- Ocean Waves 2\n- Rain \u0026 Thunder\n- Atmospheres: Serenity\n- Atmospheres: Awakening\n- Atmospheres: Space\n- Atmospheres: Drifting\n- Atmospheres: Peace\n- Atmospheres: Floating\n- Atmospheres: Soaring\n- Medium Rain\n- Light Rain \n- Waterfall \n- Flowing Creek \n- Pink Noise\n- Forest\n\n* BrainWave's binaural tones are an effective therapy for Tinnitus as it provides an audio mask for tonal Tinnitus while also reducing the neural hyperactivity that underlies Tinnitus. \n\n* Choose from 10 Gentle Alarms or your own iTunes Music.\n\n* Binaural tones should not be used while driving or operating machinery"},"versionHistory":[{"versionDisplay":"9.0","releaseNotes":"Thanks for making BrainWave the Top-Ranked Binaural App for 11 years! * This update improves the iTunes integration and Accessibility * Headphones/Earbuds are required for Binaural Tones to be Effective * Affordable One-time purchase with No Subscriptions or In-App Purchases * Combine Advanced Multi-stage Binaural Programs with 5 Background Audio Modes: Ambience, Other App, Ambience + Other App, iTunes, iTunes + Ambience * Includes UI for iPhone \u0026 iPad * Supports Family Share \u0026 iOS 13 Dark Mode\n* Combine Brainwaves with Ambience and Another App by selecting background mode 'Ambience + Other App' * To use Another App for the Background Audio choose 'Other App'. \n* Added the ability to play and pause audio using Lock Screen and Remote Controls only when using Brainwaves with the included Ambience. \n* When using background modes that allow other audio apps or iTunes Music to be playing Lockscreen controls will only affect iTunes or the other app.\n* If the audio stops when the app is backgrounded or the screen locks please restart the device with a full shutdown as this is the result of low RAM memory which causes iOS to suspend background audio.\n\n* How it Works *\n\nDuring the entrainment process, two different carrier tones are played into the left and right ears. The frequency difference between these tones matches the brainwave frequency of the target state of mind. The listener will hear these carrier tones as an audible tone, however, when processing these two different tones the human brain will perceive the small frequency difference between the tones as an inaudible periodic beat. When exposed to this beat the listener's brainwaves will begin to synchronize with the beat frequency. What allows the human brain to perceive this beat is our directional hearing system, located in the brain stem. The brain's directional hearing system calculates frequency shifts between sound entering the left and right ear to quickly locate the direction of a sound, but when that difference is rhythmic, as with binaural tones, the brain synchronizes with the pattern. This process is more effective in the presence of background noise or ambience, which allows humans to hear and locate even subtle sounds, like an animal moving nearby in a forest that is filled with noise.\n\nAs an example, the human ear can't directly perceive the .5 - 2 Hz Delta-wave frequencies associated with deep sleep because it is well below the human hearing range, but if you wear headphones or earbuds with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 136 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 1 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat, in this case matching a low delta wave frequency associated with sleep. As you listen, your own brainwaves will begin to match that frequency.\n\n* Brainwave Frequencies *\n\nGamma waves (30-44 Hz):\nAssociated with high-level information processing, multi-tasking, excitement, and high energy.\n\nHigh-Beta waves (18-29 Hz):\nAssociated with mental activities such as math, planning, and design.\n\nMid-Beta waves (15-17 Hz):\nIncreased problem-solving ability, focus, and alertness.\n\nLow-Beta waves (12-14 Hz):\nRelaxed, yet still mentally sharp\n\nHigh-Alpha waves (10-11 Hz):\nRelaxed, centered, tranquil\n\nLow-Alpha waves (8-9 Hz):\nRelaxed, almost meditative but still aware\n\nTheta waves (4-7 Hz):\nAssociated with deep meditation, creativity, intuition, and dream-like states. Theta waves also occur during REM sleep and the early stages of deep, slow-wave sleep.\n\nDelta waves (.5-3 Hz):\nDeep, slow-wave sleep. Slow-wave sleep allows the brain to recover from daily activities. It is important for hormonal regulation, growth, memory retention, and physical renewal.\n\nWarning: Do not use BrainWave while driving or operating machinery.\nNote: If your vehicle Auto-Plays connected devices use the Ambience+Other background mode, not Ambience-Only, to prevent Lockscreen access.","releaseDate":"2020-06-22"},{"versionDisplay":"8.1.4","releaseNotes":"Thanks for making BrainWave the Top-Selling Brainwave Entrainment App for 11 years!

It is also what allows humans to perceive the beat frequency produced by tuning forks.\n\nAs an example, the human ear can't directly perceive the .5 - 2 Hz Delta-wave frequencies associated with deep sleep because it is well below the human hearing range, but if you wear headphones or earbuds with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 136 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 1 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat, in this case matching a low delta wave frequency associated with sleep.  As you listen, your own brainwaves will begin to match that frequency.  The process is the same for other states of mind and their associated brainwave frequencies.\n\nTo help make the process more effective and enjoyable ambient background sounds have been included in the app.  The balance between the volume of the brainwave tones and the ambient background is also adjustable, allowing you to create the most relaxing and effective brainwave entrainment experience possible.\n\n* Brainwave Frequencies *\nDifferent states of mind will display a dominant frequency, but all brainwaves are present in a mix at all times.\n\nGamma waves (30-44 Hz):\nAssociated with high-level information processing, multi-tasking, excitement, and high energy.\n\nHigh-Beta waves (18-29 Hz):\nAssociated with mental activities such as math, planning, and design.\n\nMid-Beta waves (15-17 Hz):\nIncreased problem-solving ability, focus, and alertness.\n\nLow-Beta waves (12-14 Hz):\nRelaxed, yet still mentally sharp\n\nHigh-Alpha waves (10-11 Hz):\nRelaxed, centered, tranquil\n   \nLow-Alpha waves (8-9 Hz):\nRelaxed, almost meditative but still aware\n                    \nTheta waves (4-7 Hz):\nAssociated with deep meditation, creativity, intuition, and dream-like states.  Theta waves also occur during REM sleep and the early stages of deep, slow-wave sleep.\n                   \nDelta waves (.5-3 Hz):\nDeep, slow-wave sleep.  Slow-wave sleep allows the brain to recover from daily activities.  It is important for hormonal regulation, growth, memory retention, and physical renewal.","releaseDate":"2019-09-04"},{"versionDisplay":"7.8","releaseNotes":"Thanks for making BrainWave the top-selling brainwave entrainment app in the App Store for 8 years.
