Day or night, just aim your device skyward to see a live 3D map of the heavens, complete with beautifully illustrated constellations, stars, planets, and satellites. A special night mode helps you read the map in the dark, while integrated weather reports show the best times for stargazing. You can even have notifications alert you to future astronomical events.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I would have never known the International Space Station orbits the Earth about 15 times per day. I now watch it orbit twice just about every night.  On non-cloudy nights anyway.  It’s amazing. It’s like a star shooting across the night sky and Night Sky alerts us a couple minutes in advance then shows us exactly where to look. My 6 yr. old daughter has changed from wanting to be a veterinarian to wanting to be a space station driver.  ;-)<br />Not sure if the main intention of this app is educational or to get kids dreaming of space travel but it does both very well. Only had it for a few days now so it will be fun to see what else it does.  I imagine we have only scratched the surface. Definitely spend the $10 on the year membership. Jumping from planet to planet and seeing the sky and stars from their perspective is worth $100.  We saw a planetarium show this week at the Tulsa Air and Space Museum.  This app is like your own show. There is a ton of activity going on in the night sky. It’s so much more interesting and fun to see when you know what you’re looking at.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love this app but lately it’s not picking up everything. There is a bright object to the top left of the moon right now, in close relation visually, and it’s not registering on the app. I gave it the benefit of the doubt that the bodies showing up a little further out were it but none of them lined up with position in the sky in relation and visual proximity to the moon. The app used to be spot on. Second time in 2 months I’ve been disappointed with as many times using it. Last time it wouldn’t show me where the moon was at all when I was trying to brag about the app to friends.<br /><br />Next night:<br />It was Mars. Why wouldn’t it be superimposed over one another and have something that says what it is? And when you try to zoom in to a local body you get visually flooded with our local cluster of galaxies (honestly, that’s annoying. I know it’s a combination of our galaxy with other galaxies mingled in, but help me learn from local bodies! At least give a staged zoom prompt where you can zoom to the inner planets, then the outer planets, then the galaxy, followed by the super clusters if you wanna take it deep lol. Also, this used to have a super easy to use function where you type in a local body and arrows guide you to its location in the sky. Why would you get rid of that?! 🤷‍♂️</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Thank you for your review.  You are able to completely customize how Night Sky presents the sky from Preferences within the main menu of Night Sky so we would encourage exploring the app some more.  Our app does accurately display the positions of stars and planets so it&#39;s not clear why you have been experiencing issues.

I now watch it orbit twice just about every night.  On non-cloudy nights anyway.  It’s amazing. It’s like a star shooting across the night sky and Night Sky alerts us a couple minutes in advance then shows us exactly where to look. My 6 yr. old daughter has changed from wanting to be a veterinarian to wanting to be a space station driver.  ;-)\nNot sure if the main intention of this app is educational or to get kids dreaming of space travel but it does both very well. Only had it for a few days now so it will be fun to see what else it does.  I imagine we have only scratched the surface. Definitely spend the $10 on the year membership. Jumping from planet to planet and seeing the sky and stars from their perspective is worth $100.  We saw a planetarium show this week at the Tulsa Air and Space Museum.

There is a bright object to the top left of the moon right now, in close relation visually, and it’s not registering on the app. I gave it the benefit of the doubt that the bodies showing up a little further out were it but none of them lined up with position in the sky in relation and visual proximity to the moon. The app used to be spot on. Second time in 2 months I’ve been disappointed with as many times using it. Last time it wouldn’t show me where the moon was at all when I was trying to brag about the app to friends.\n\nNext night:\nIt was Mars. Why wouldn’t it be superimposed over one another and have something that says what it is? And when you try to zoom in to a local body you get visually flooded with our local cluster of galaxies (honestly, that’s annoying. I know it’s a combination of our galaxy with other galaxies mingled in, but help me learn from local bodies! At least give a staged zoom prompt where you can zoom to the inner planets, then the outer planets, then the galaxy, followed by the super clusters if you wanna take it deep lol.

It’s offers you so many features without even paying for it, as you would have to do for any other app. It’s crazy. Because it’s a free app that offers you AR experiences to blend with your night sky, real time constellations, stars, galaxies, Nebulas, satellites, and even major NASA things like, Hubble Telescope, International Space Station, Meteor Showers And so much more. It has tours of planets too. They also have media news updates everyday about anything going on in space like, The Mercury and Mars Conjunction and Major things that will be able to be seen with the Naked Eye.\nI’ve dragged this on for too long but, over all it’s the best app to use for everyone who likes Astronomy and for Astronomers.\n\n-Iyana","title":"Honestly, worth it","userName":"Gkgmoskfjfjdjfjfndhdhhdhfj"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4153031444","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-05-15T09:49:31Z","developerResponse":{"id":12549042,"body":"Updated response December 23 2019:  Thank you for your review.

In order to make sure your device is calibrated correctly, please make sure you are not using a third party case on your device. This can sometimes interfere with the compass causing an inaccurate reading. Also please make sure you have allowed Night Sky access to your location, you can confirm this by running the Tutorial from the main menu. Also you can manually align the sky using the compass alignment tool, just tap the triangular shape in the top left hand side of the screen to do this then swipe the sky to tweak alignment.

If you just want an app to show you what is in the sky that is a good app. Night sky is too complicated.\n\nI think I like this app but it is a little confusing to use. First it doesn't seem to reflect the actual sky. For instance, when I point it at Ursa Major it doesn’t show it exactly where it is in the sky. So, I am never sure what I am looking at when I look at the actual sky. It is like it just shows a map of the sky and isn’t really showing me the actual sky. I tried to use the sky blending but I can’t figure out how it works. The tutorial is lacking.  I would like to see more explanation of each feature in the help section. Also in the preferences, there is no explanation of what each option is. For example, what does it mean if I enable the “moon” preference? I saw in one of the reviews the developers said to use the compass align to fix the view of the sky. I tried that but how does it work? What does the + or - degrees mean? More explanation is needed. I want to just point it at the sky and see exactly what I am pointing at be reflected in the view. I have had this app for years but just picked it up again. The older version was much simpler and more accurate.","title":"Nice app but a little confusing to use","userName":"TKC1919"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6228104916","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-22T13:12:45Z","developerResponse":{"id":16828268,"body":"Thank you for your review!

The app didn’t respond as I moved my iPad—I could spin the display in any direction so North could be South, e.g.—so essentially it was no help at all with locating anything. Given that the user is likely to enter areas with no WiFi, there should be some way of addressing this scenario.\nWhich leads me to my other complaint. The tutorial is so bare boned it’s difficult to figure out how to use some features. I don’t mind exploring on my own; in fact it’s rather fun. But sometimes I’d discover how to do something and later couldn’t remember how I did it, and there’s no guide to help, so I’d have to figure it out all over again. There were a couple of features I couldn’t get at all, like the Siri voice command to find an object.\nSo, overall, while the app offers great feature, it doesn’t provide a very good means of helping you use them.

Find the end, close it and look for the ISS icon to appear where the arrows on the watch are pointing. Nothing. Turn to go back inside, and there it is much further north gliding across the sky NOT where the arrows/flight path were pointing!
