Best I've used by a mile\" - J.K. Rowling, Author\n\n“Give Pzizz a try! Love that app and helps me fall asleep or nap on command.” - Daniel Weinard, Co-founder of Shopify\n\n\"I use Pzizz most nights-excellent. Briliantly configurable.\" - James Rhodes, Pianist\n\nPRESS\n“…Hibbert credits the app for helping cure his insomnia and diminish his postgame dependence on Ambien.” – NBA Star Roy Hibbert speaking to Sports Illustrated\n\n“That night, I nestled under my covers, downloaded the full version of Pzizz and turned it on… I was out before 20 minutes had passed and haven't looked back since.” - Jenna Wortham, New York Times\n\n“Pzizz helps you get to sleep faster and get more restful sleep with a combination of soothing sounds and voice cues aimed at helping you relax, destress, and get to sleep. In my experience, it works really well.” - Adam Pash, Lifehacker\n\nFeatured in The New York Times, WIRED, Engadget, Gizmodo, Product Hunt, Lifehacker, Mashable, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and more!\n\nSLEEP MODULE\nChoose a time to wakeup and let Pzizz quickly quiet your mind, put you to sleep, keep you asleep, and wake you up transformed. \n\nCustomize your sleep sessions with different genres of narrations and dreamscapes, all designed with the latest research to invoke deep relaxation and rest.  \n\nNAP MODULE\nNapping has been proven to enhance performance, alertness, and improve your mood. Customize your naps with our specially designed nap narrations. Get rid of that groggy feeling and improve your energy levels.\n\nFOCUS MODULE\nThe focus module is music designed to help you get more work done.\n\nBuilt around ‘focuscapes,’ environments of sound that help you get in the zone and be productive, backed by the same thorough research we use to create our dreamscapes.\n\nEach focuscape has a ‘focus’ section which gets you into full concentration and a ‘cooldown’ section which brings you back out gently.\n\nWHAT MAKES PZIZZ SO MUCH BETTER? \n*Simplicity* Sleep at the push of a button! Unlike other sleep solutions, you don’t have to change your behavior, keep a sleep diary, or limit your activities. Just listen to Pzizz, and enjoy incredible sleep. \n\n*No Side Effects* Our only side effect is sleep! Unlike medications or supplements, you’ll never have to worry about adverse effects.\n\n*Variety* Every time you listen to Pzizz it creates a unique session for you. This ensures your brain doesn’t get fatigued from hearing the same things over and over again, and helps maintain effectiveness over time.\n\n*Highly customizable* Adjust sleep duration, volumes, 3D effect, and narrator for a fully personalized listening experience. Also: integration with Apple Health! Connect with Apple’s Health app to add sleep and focus data to your dashboard.\n\n*Clinically Validated* Pzizz is incredibly effective and clinically validated.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Pzizz helps you quickly quiet your mind, fall asleep, stay asleep, and wake up refreshed.<br /><br />We use beautiful “dreamscapes” — a mix of music, voiceovers and sound effects designed using the latest clinical research — to help you sleep better at night or take power naps during the day.<br /><br />WHAT PEOPLE SAY<br />&quot;I love Pzizz... Best I&#39;ve used by a mile&quot; - J.K. Rowling, Author<br /><br />“Give Pzizz a try! Love that app and helps me fall asleep or nap on command.” - Daniel Weinard, Co-founder of Shopify<br /><br />&quot;I use Pzizz most nights-excellent. Briliantly configurable.&quot; - James Rhodes, Pianist<br /><br />PRESS<br />“…Hibbert credits the app for helping cure his insomnia and diminish his postgame dependence on Ambien.” – NBA Star Roy Hibbert speaking to Sports Illustrated<br /><br />“That night, I nestled under my covers, downloaded the full version of Pzizz and turned it on… I was out before 20 minutes had passed and haven&#39;t looked back since.” - Jenna Wortham, New York Times<br /><br />“Pzizz helps you get to sleep faster and get more restful sleep with a combination of soothing sounds and voice cues aimed at helping you relax, destress, and get to sleep. In my experience, it works really well.” - Adam Pash, Lifehacker<br /><br />Featured in The New York Times, WIRED, Engadget, Gizmodo, Product Hunt, Lifehacker, Mashable, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and more!<br /><br />SLEEP MODULE<br />Choose a time to wakeup and let Pzizz quickly quiet your mind, put you to sleep, keep you asleep, and wake you up transformed. <br /><br />Customize your sleep sessions with different genres of narrations and dreamscapes, all designed with the latest research to invoke deep relaxation and rest.  <br /><br />NAP MODULE<br />Napping has been proven to enhance performance, alertness, and improve your mood. Customize your naps with our specially designed nap narrations. Get rid of that groggy feeling and improve your energy levels.<br /><br />FOCUS MODULE<br />The focus module is music designed to help you get more work done.<br /><br />Built around ‘focuscapes,’ environments of sound that help you get in the zone and be productive, backed by the same thorough research we use to create our dreamscapes.<br /><br />Each focuscape has a ‘focus’ section which gets you into full concentration and a ‘cooldown’ section which brings you back out gently.<br /><br />WHAT MAKES PZIZZ SO MUCH BETTER? <br />*Simplicity* Sleep at the push of a button! Unlike other sleep solutions, you don’t have to change your behavior, keep a sleep diary, or limit your activities. Just listen to Pzizz, and enjoy incredible sleep. <br /><br />*No Side Effects* Our only side effect is sleep! Unlike medications or supplements, you’ll never have to worry about adverse effects.<br /><br />*Variety* Every time you listen to Pzizz it creates a unique session for you. This ensures your brain doesn’t get fatigued from hearing the same things over and over again, and helps maintain effectiveness over time.<br /><br />*Highly customizable* Adjust sleep duration, volumes, 3D effect, and narrator for a fully personalized listening experience. Also: integration with Apple Health! Connect with Apple’s Health app to add sleep and focus data to your dashboard.<br /><br />*Clinically Validated* Pzizz is incredibly effective and clinically validated.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I struggle with ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety. Which, in my opinion, is the worst combination of mental illnesses that anyone could have. I was at a point in my life when I basically, in simple terms, was hating life. I couldn’t sleep, eat, or socialize. My eating habits got the point where I was losing weight. I eventually got to the point where I started conflicting self harm, such as picking at my fingers, pulling my hair out, and punching myself in the face. But, eventually, I realized what was going on and decided that I wouldn’t let it happen anymore. So I searched up on the App Store some good meditation apps and this was the first one that came up. So, I downloaded it and used it one night. That next morning, I swear to god, I actually felt like I wanted to socialize with people!!!! When I went to school that day, I basically felt like a whole different person. I made new friends, socialized, and didn’t keep my hood up and head down all day (which was what I usually did at school). So, in simple terms, this app has changed my life, relationships, and my ability to actually sleep through the entire night. If you have read this far, thank you so so so much. It really means a lot 🙏🏻<br />😊😊😊</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I plead with all my friends struggling with sleep to seriously try Pzizz. Use it every night and things will get better. There is a time and place for other types of mindfulness and meditation apps, but sleep is absolutely not that time for me. Pzizz is purely and beautifully focused on falling and staying asleep. My anxious brain anchors onto trying to complete the ‘tasks’ set out in other apps. I would stay awake through the end of those guided exercises, perhaps having meditated, but still brain-on-wide-awake. <br /><br />I have trouble falling asleep and my husband has trouble staying asleep. Pzizz has helped both of us so distinctly improve our sleep it almost makes me want to cry how simple and joyful a solution it was. We now welcome what we call the “Sweet Pzizz Man” into our room every night to take us to glorious Dream Town. Cannot thank you enough for creating this app, Pzizz.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>My therapist recommended this to help calm my anxious mind at bedtime. I blew it off at first, because I’m not a meditation person. I’ve never been able to do it. <br />One night, During a particularly bad bout of restlessness, i downloaded Pzizz out of desperation for sleep. At first it felt cheesy, but I figured it was harmless at worst. Surprise, surprise... I was out within 15 minutes. I tried again the next night, thinking it must have been a fluke. Same thing. Asleep within 15 minutes. <br /><br />I used to lay in bed awake for hours. This app helps me get comfortable, then gives me something to focus on that isn’t my extensive to-do list for the next day. <br />I can not recommend it enough. I even pay for the full version, and I’m cheap. It’s the least I can do for how much easier they’ve made bed time! I also profusely thanked my therapist.</p>

Best I've used by a mile\" - J.K. Rowling, Author\n\n“Give Pzizz a try! Love that app and helps me fall asleep or nap on command.” - Daniel Weinard, Co-founder of Shopify\n\n\"I use Pzizz most nights-excellent. Briliantly configurable.\" - James Rhodes, Pianist\n\nPRESS\n“…Hibbert credits the app for helping cure his insomnia and diminish his postgame dependence on Ambien.” – NBA Star Roy Hibbert speaking to Sports Illustrated\n\n“That night, I nestled under my covers, downloaded the full version of Pzizz and turned it on… I was out before 20 minutes had passed and haven't looked back since.” - Jenna Wortham, New York Times\n\n“Pzizz helps you get to sleep faster and get more restful sleep with a combination of soothing sounds and voice cues aimed at helping you relax, destress, and get to sleep. In my experience, it works really well.” - Adam Pash, Lifehacker\n\nFeatured in The New York Times, WIRED, Engadget, Gizmodo, Product Hunt, Lifehacker, Mashable, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and more!\n\nSLEEP MODULE\nChoose a time to wakeup and let Pzizz quickly quiet your mind, put you to sleep, keep you asleep, and wake you up transformed. \n\nCustomize your sleep sessions with different genres of narrations and dreamscapes, all designed with the latest research to invoke deep relaxation and rest.  \n\nNAP MODULE\nNapping has been proven to enhance performance, alertness, and improve your mood. Customize your naps with our specially designed nap narrations. Get rid of that groggy feeling and improve your energy levels.\n\nFOCUS MODULE\nThe focus module is music designed to help you get more work done.\n\nBuilt around ‘focuscapes,’ environments of sound that help you get in the zone and be productive, backed by the same thorough research we use to create our dreamscapes.\n\nEach focuscape has a ‘focus’ section which gets you into full concentration and a ‘cooldown’ section which brings you back out gently.\n\nWHAT MAKES PZIZZ SO MUCH BETTER? \n*Simplicity* Sleep at the push of a button! Unlike other sleep solutions, you don’t have to change your behavior, keep a sleep diary, or limit your activities. Just listen to Pzizz, and enjoy incredible sleep. \n\n*No Side Effects* Our only side effect is sleep! Unlike medications or supplements, you’ll never have to worry about adverse effects.\n\n*Variety* Every time you listen to Pzizz it creates a unique session for you. This ensures your brain doesn’t get fatigued from hearing the same things over and over again, and helps maintain effectiveness over time.\n\n*Highly customizable* Adjust sleep duration, volumes, 3D effect, and narrator for a fully personalized listening experience. Also: integration with Apple Health! Connect with Apple’s Health app to add sleep and focus data to your dashboard.\n\n*Clinically Validated* Pzizz is incredibly effective and clinically validated.

Which, in my opinion, is the worst combination of mental illnesses that anyone could have. I was at a point in my life when I basically, in simple terms, was hating life. I couldn’t sleep, eat, or socialize. My eating habits got the point where I was losing weight. I eventually got to the point where I started conflicting self harm, such as picking at my fingers, pulling my hair out, and punching myself in the face. But, eventually, I realized what was going on and decided that I wouldn’t let it happen anymore. So I searched up on the App Store some good meditation apps and this was the first one that came up. So, I downloaded it and used it one night. That next morning, I swear to god, I actually felt like I wanted to socialize with people!!!! When I went to school that day, I basically felt like a whole different person. I made new friends, socialized, and didn’t keep my hood up and head down all day (which was what I usually did at school). So, in simple terms, this app has changed my life, relationships, and my ability to actually sleep through the entire night. If you have read this far, thank you so so so much.

Use it every night and things will get better. There is a time and place for other types of mindfulness and meditation apps, but sleep is absolutely not that time for me. Pzizz is purely and beautifully focused on falling and staying asleep. My anxious brain anchors onto trying to complete the ‘tasks’ set out in other apps. I would stay awake through the end of those guided exercises, perhaps having meditated, but still brain-on-wide-awake. \n\nI have trouble falling asleep and my husband has trouble staying asleep. Pzizz has helped both of us so distinctly improve our sleep it almost makes me want to cry how simple and joyful a solution it was.

Asleep within 15 minutes. \n\nI used to lay in bed awake for hours. This app helps me get comfortable, then gives me something to focus on that isn’t my extensive to-do list for the next day. \nI can not recommend it enough.

It’s been a lifesaver.\n\nI especially like the new feature of being able to choose from multiple background tracks because when it was just one it got monotonous and that was less effective for me to fall asleep because I was anticipating the next phrase or sound.\n\nSome of the phrases used are repetitive and adverb heavy, but that’s a total nit pick.","title":"When nothing else works for my insomnia, I Pzizz!","userName":"andregirl"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5546390700","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-02-18T05:04:14Z","developerResponse":{"id":14454209,"body":"Wow, thank you!

Fortunately, this is a none issue since falling asleep is pretty difficult when\n\n2) The audio -voice and music- take on this scratchy quality, as if a bag of chips or something were pressed up against the speaker, whenever I enter the “Falling” phase. The first time this happened I naturally figured that something was wrong with my phone’s speakers, so I ran songs from different genres (and a couple of audiobooks for good measure) and. O scratchy sound. Everything sounds fine when I start using Pzizz, but as soon as I get to ‘Falling’, the audio becomes unbearable.

In fact, I expected nothing more than continued frustration at my inability to sleep.\n\nTo my great surprise, I quickly fell asleep and, even better, stayed asleep on my first try. Still a skeptic, I assumed that I experienced a fluke. Three weeks later, and I’m a true believer.\n\nHaving undergone successful hypnotherapy several years ago for an unrelated problem, I have concluded that the male voice is hypnotizing me. I was told by the respected psychiatrist who specialized in hypnosis that I would make a great subject, my protestations notwithstanding. I have not forgotten how the mere sound of his voice put my mind into an altered state of consciousness. No swinging pendulums or watches...just a low, soothing voice.\n\nAfter years of frustration, I am now able to fall asleep, and I cannot be happier. The app is beautifully designed and simple to use.

effects designed using the latest clinical research — to help you sleep better at night or take power naps during the day.\n\nWHAT PEOPLE SAY\n\"I love Pzizz... Best I've used by a mile\" - J.K. Rowling, Author\n\n“Give Pzizz a try! Love that app and helps me fall asleep or nap on command.” - Daniel Weinard, Co-founder of Shopify\n\n\"I use Pzizz most nights-excellent. Briliantly configurable.\" - James Rhodes, Pianist\n\nPRESS\n“…Hibbert credits the app for helping cure his insomnia and diminish his postgame dependence on Ambien.” – NBA Star Roy Hibbert speaking to Sports Illustrated\n\n“That night, I nestled under my covers, downloaded the full version of Pzizz and turned it on… I was out before 20 minutes had passed and haven't looked back since.” - Jenna Wortham, New York Times\n\n“Pzizz helps you get to sleep faster and get more restful sleep with a combination of soothing sounds and voice cues aimed at helping you relax, destress, and get to sleep. In my experience, it works really well.” - Adam Pash, Lifehacker\n\nFeatured in The New York Times, WIRED, Engadget, Gizmodo, Product Hunt, Lifehacker, Mashable, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and more!\n\nSLEEP MODULE\nChoose a time to wakeup and let Pzizz quickly quiet your mind, put you to sleep, keep you asleep, and wake you up transformed. \n\nCustomize your sleep sessions with different genres of narrations and dreamscapes, all designed with the latest research to invoke deep relaxation and rest.  \n\nNAP MODULE\nNapping has been proven to enhance performance, alertness, and improve your mood. Customize your naps with our specially designed nap narrations. Get rid of that groggy feeling and improve your energy levels.\n\nFOCUS MODULE\nThe focus module is music designed to help you get more work done.\n\nBuilt around ‘focuscapes,’ environments of sound that help you get in the zone and be productive, backed by the same thorough research we use to create our dreamscapes.\n\nEach focuscape has a ‘focus’ section which gets you into full concentration and a ‘cooldown’ section which brings you back out gently.\n\nWHAT MAKES PZIZZ SO MUCH BETTER? \n*Simplicity* Sleep at the push of a button! Unlike other sleep solutions, you don’t have to change your behavior, keep a sleep diary, or limit your activities. Just listen to Pzizz, and enjoy incredible sleep. \n\n*No Side Effects* Our only side effect is sleep! Unlike medications or supplements, you’ll never have to worry about adverse effects.\n\n*Variety* Every time you listen to Pzizz it creates a unique session for you. This ensures your brain doesn’t get fatigued from hearing the same things over and over again, and helps maintain effectiveness over time.\n\n*Highly customizable* Adjust sleep duration, volumes, 3D effect, and narrator for a fully personalized listening experience. Also: integration with Apple Health! Connect with Apple’s Health app to add sleep and focus data to your dashboard.\n\n*Clinically Validated* Pzizz is incredibly effective and clinically validated.
