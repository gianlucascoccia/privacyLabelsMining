      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So I literally just started this program on Saturday. I have been athletic in the past in my life, and am sort of “skinny fat,” now due to a couple injuries that took me out of the game, AND I was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos syndrome, and have been deconditioning and living with pain, plus working FT and raising my 4 kids. Since starting it Saturday, I have already noticed a HUGE difference! (It’s Wednesday). I tend to build muscle quickly but this is amazing. Several people have already been commenting, asking what’s different. <br /><br />I can feel new muscles in my glutes, my quads, my hamstrings, I have arm definition, and even my ABS are getting defined after 4 babies. I am forcing my husband to download the app, because there’s literally something for everyone! I feel motivated, and being able to do a different video every day, or more than one, plus getting to choose the time, helps to make sure I go back to it every time. The notifications aren’t even annoying, and I can set when they send them! Lol<br /><br />I’ve done the X-Tend Barre almost every day (it’s HARD, but an amazing workout and you can always modify), then I’ve added some Pilates and recovery yoga in there. Best app I’ve ever tried for guided exercise! And the Barre instructor is amazing. Super motivating and has tons of incredible little tips the whole time to make sure you’re doing everything correctly. 5/5! (No I was not paid for this, I’m just super happy, lol).</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’m a very active/fit person and still get a real challenge which is hard to find online! I’d much rather follow classes than lead my own workouts because it keeps me from diddle-daddling and keeps me pumped. <br />This app keeps me so motivated and excited to workout, they have so many options of different types of workouts so you can do what you want. You should LOVE your workouts! This keeps me on track and keeps my workouts done in timely manner. <br />I love the yoga! I finally found an online option that challenges me! I’ve been a yogi for 3 years without following classes and the yoga52 program has challenged my strength, balance &amp; flexibility in ways I never have before. <br />I do the xbbarre, yoga &amp; Pilates. <br />Only thing I would change would be having longer barre classes, full body/cardio ones like an hour long that are truly hard to complete. Burn out everyyy muscle group. For the ones who are already advanced. Right now I’ll take 2-3 different barre classes/day or repeat some to get the full burn.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Today was my second class with this app. I have been following Andrea on IG for a year or longer now, and had always wanted to try this app. For one reason or another I wouldn’t . I finally did yesterday and I have to say, it more than surpassed my expectations!! I love group classes because I’m not super social but I love being around people; it’s weird but I think people can relate. Although I love work out classes it has been years since I last went to one because I have children, work and school obligations that impede me from committing to same time classes . These feel like real life clases because there is always a coach cheering you on and checking your form and technique . You can hear comments to others participants, it’s super Interactive and honestly my favorite thing.  I am still on the 14 day feee trial but I am no doubt buying the annual . I could not stop talking about this to my boyfriend yesterday, I love the concept ! So thankful for entrepreneurs giving back to us with their talents. 💛 Thank  you!</p>

For example, we may collect and display fitness data, such as heart rate, and use it to estimate your calorie burn while performing exercises with Openfit programs.\nInformation We Automatically Receive:\n\n- Sources of Information We Automatically Receive: We automatically receive and store certain technical information about your device and systems you use to connect with and interact with us. For example, like many other websites, we use “cookies” to recognize your device and enhance your experience on our websites as described below.

However, because California law broadly defines a “sale” of your personal information to include the act of making cookie and other similar data available to third party advertising and analytics providers when you use Openfit Services (even though we never receive any money in exchange), we are required to disclose those practices here.\n\n- Our Cookie and Pixel Tags: Like almost every company, Openfit uses cookies and similar technologies to operate our websites and online services and to collect data. Cookies are small text files placed on your computer or mobile device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie is a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device and can contain other information as well. We use cookies on our websites and Openfit Services to recognize your device, store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide internet-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze our products, and perform and fulfill other legitimate purposes.\n\nCertain Openfit Services and websites contain electronic images known as pixel tags (also called web beacons or gifs) that we use to help deliver and recognize cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and gather usage and performance data. We also include pixels in our emails to tell if you open and act on them.\n\nOpenfit mobile apps use device IDs to help conduct analytics and deliver ads. Apple and Android mobile devices each generate a mobile advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in much the same way that cookies are used on websites.\n\n- Third Party Cookies and Pixel Tags: Our websites and services include pixel tags and cookies and mobiles IDs from third parties. In some cases, a third party uses cookies and pixel tags or mobile IDs to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, third parties use cookies and pixel tags or mobile IDs to track interaction with and the effectiveness of content (such as videos, news content) and ads. When your browser connects to a third party’s web server to retrieve content or pixel tags, that third party is able to set or read its own cookies on your device and may use those cookies to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services using those cookies.\n\nBelow is a chart that identifies the third party advertising and analytics providers we use on some or all of the Openfit Services, such as Openfit.com and other sites and apps. The chart also notes their purposes for using your cookie data, and ways you can opt-out of their use of your cookies. This list may change from time to time, and we will take commercially reasonable efforts to keep it current.\n\nCompany/Service\tBusiness or Commercial Purpose(s)\tPrivacy Notices\tManage Settings (opt-out)\nYahoo\tAdvertising\thttps://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.htm\thttps://www.verizonmedia.com/policies/us/en/verizonmedia/privacy/controls/index.html\nSee the industry opt-outs below.\n\nTealium\tAnalytics\thttps://tealium.com/privacy/\thttps://tealium.com/preferences/\nMarin Software\tAdvertising\thttps://www.marinsoftware.com/privacy/privacy-central\thttps://www.marinsoftware.com/privacy/marin-tracker-opt-out\nOptimizely\tAnalytics\thttps://www.optimizely.com/privacy/\thttps://www.optimizely.com/legal/opt-out/\nSteelHouse\tAdvertising\thttps://steelhouse.com/privacy-policy/\thttps://steelhouse.com/opt-out/\nSee the industry opt-outs below.\n\nFuelX\tAdvertising\thttps://fuelx.com/privacy-policy/\tEmail legal@fuelx.com\nHotjar\tAdvertising\thttps://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/privacy\thttps://www.hotjar.com/legal/compliance/opt-out\nGoogle Doubleclick\tAdvertising; Analytics\thttp://www.google.com/policies/privacy/\thttps://policies.google.com/privacy#infochoices;\nhttps://adssettings.google.com/authenticated\n\nSee the industry opt-outs below.\n\nGoogle Adsense; Google Analytics\tAdvertising; Analytics\twww.google.com/policies/privacy/partners\thttps://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout\nSee the industry opt-outs below.\n\nMicrosoft\tAdvertising\thttps://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement\thttps://account.microsoft.com/privacy/ad-settings/signedout?ru=https:%2F%2Faccount.microsoft.com%2Fprivacy%2Fad-settings\nSee the industry opt-outs below.\n\nSnapchat\tAdvertising\thttps://www.snap.com/en-US/privacy/privacy-policy/;\nhttps://www.snap.com/en-US/cookie-policy\n\nhttps://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/advertising-preferences\nFloodlight\tAdvertising\thttps://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites\thttps://adssettings.google.com/authenticated\nPinterest\tAdvertising\thttps://policy.pinterest.com/en/privacy-policy\tSee the industry opt-outs below.\n \n\nTo opt-out from third party collection or use of cookie data, and to learn more about their privacy practices, click on the links above.\n\n- Industry opt-out: Many of these companies are also members of associations, which provide a simple way to opt out of analytics and ad targeting, which you can access at:\n\nUnited States:\nNAI (http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.aspx) and\nDAA (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)\nCanada: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (https://youradchoices.ca/)\n- Browser cookie controls: Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.\n- Pixel Tag Controls: You can disable pixel tags in emails by changing the settings on your email client to prevent the automatic downloading of images.\n- Mobile Ad ID controls: Each operating system provides options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising ID.- Do Not Track Signals: Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Openfit Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above. To find out more about \"Do Not Track,\" you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com/.\nDoes Openfit Share the Information and Data it Receives?\n\nWe value the trust our customers place in us to safeguard their personal information. We share personal information we collect as described below:\n- Third-Party Service Providers: We disclose any of the categories of personal information described in this policy to third party companies and individuals for business purposes performed on our behalf to better serve you. For example, we use third parties to help us make our products and services available to you, fulfill orders you may have placed, process credit card payments, provide customer service, ship postal mail, deliver your packages, conduct market research or information analysis, manage promotions, and contact you in connection with various Openfit Services. In these instances, we may need to provide your information to these third parties for such purposes.\n- Affiliates and Subsidiaries; Openfit Partners; Third Party Offers: Openfit may share your personal information with its affiliates, subsidiaries and parent companies. Openfit occasionally partners with third parties to learn more about our customers so we can service you better or offer products or services that we feel may be useful to you (\"Openfit Partners\"). In such case, we may disclose to a Openfit Partner certain information, such as your contact information (name, email address, phone number, billing or shipping address) and purchase history. If you request information from an Openfit Partner, we may disclose additional information such as your email address, phone number and other contact information, so the Openfit Partner can provide you with the information you requested. If you purchased a product or service from an Openfit Partner, we will also disclose your payment information, such as credit card information so they can complete your purchase. We may disclose aggregated, de-identified information to Openfit Partners: (i) so the Openfit Partners can provide you with advertisements tailored to your interests; (ii) for statistical analysis, research, and demographic profiling purposes; and (iii) to support our business and improve our mission to help our customers achieve their health and wellness goals.\n- Protection of Openfit and Others: We may share your information, including personally identifiable information, in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Openfit, or the legal rights of our customers, business partners, employees, agents, and contractors; (ii) protect the safety and security of our customers, or members of the public, including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) detect and protect against fraud and identity theft or to conduct risk management; (iv) comply with laws, legal process, or legal requests from any governmental or regulatory body; or (v) to enforce or apply our website Terms and Conditions and/or other agreements.\n- De-identified Data Disclosures: We may also disclose non-identifying transaction information to third parties for accounting, record keeping and other purposes. We may also disclose aggregated, de-identified user data or non-personal information with business partners, advertisers, and others.\nWhat About Third-Party and Advertisers’ Services? \n\nAt various points and pages on our websites or mobile applications, you may be able to access or utilize services offered by or in conjunction with third parties. This includes services in connection with third-party \"social media\" and other sites that would allow personal information to be transferred to such third parties (for example, Facebook Connect), and others.\n\nThese third parties have separate data collection and privacy practices independent from ours, so please review their privacy policies to understand your rights. For this reason, Openfit cannot be responsible for their policies or activities. Please contact those third parties directly if you have questions about their privacy practices.\n\nHow Secure is Information About Me?\n\nOpenfit has implemented and uses reasonable security measures designed to help prevent the loss and unauthorized access of your information. Despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or to be absolutely secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or our online services. You can help protect your personal information by not reusing any passwords you use in connection with your Openfit accounts. If you suspect a website or mobile application is pretending to be that of Openfit’s (also known as “spoofing”), do not enter any personal information, but please let us know by emailing CyberIssues@Openfit.com. Personal information may be accessed by persons within our organization, or our third party service providers, who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated above, or such other purposes as may be permitted or required by the applicable law. Personal Information we collect is maintained in the United States.\n\nWhat Happens to My Information if Openfit is Sold to or Merges With Another Company?\n\nAs we continue to develop and grow our business or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, we might sell one or more of our assets, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Customer information may also be disclosed in connection with due diligence or in preparation of a potential sale or investment.\n\nUsers Based Outside of the USA; Transfer of Personal Information\n\nLike most websites and businesses, Openfit’s websites may be accessed by an international audience. By visiting our websites, using our applications, and/or providing us with any data, you agree we may collect, process, use, and store your personal information as discussed herein, outside your resident jurisdiction (such as the U.S. or Canada). Our Openfit Partners and third party service providers may also be located outside of your jurisdiction. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions. Please note that U.S. law and those of other countries where your information may be stored and processed may offer different levels of protection for your information than your home country. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that such personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n\nHow Can I Access or Update My Information?\n\nWe want to be sure your personal information is kept accurate and complete, and for this reason we ask that you inform us in the event of any changes to your information. If you provided your information directly to Openfit, you may access or update certain personal information by visiting the applicable section within your Openfit account. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to your request to access or update your information. Please note that certain access may be subject to a fee.\n\nYour Privacy Choices: Opt-Out\n- Marketing: We offer you various ways to opt-out of receiving certain communications from us. If you would like to opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, you may click the “Unsubscribe” link found at the bottom of Openfit marketing emails that we send and follow the easy instructions to opt-out, or you may click the “Preferences” links to update your email settings. If you would like to opt-out of receiving marketing phone calls, you can inform the agent with whom you speak that you would like to be placed on Openfit’s “Do Not Call” list.

However, because California law broadly defines a “sale” of your personal information to include the act of making cookie and other similar data available to third party advertising and analytics providers when you use Openfit Services (even though we never receive any money in exchange), we are required to disclose those practices here.\n\n- Our Cookie and Pixel Tags: Like almost every company, Openfit uses cookies and similar technologies to operate our websites and online services and to collect data. Cookies are small text files placed on your computer or mobile device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie is a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device and can contain other information as well. We use cookies on our websites and Openfit Services to recognize your device, store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide internet-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze our products, and perform and fulfill other legitimate purposes.\n\nCertain Openfit Services and websites contain electronic images known as pixel tags (also called web beacons or gifs) that we use to help deliver and recognize cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and gather usage and performance data. We also include pixels in our emails to tell if you open and act on them.\n\nOpenfit mobile apps use device IDs to help conduct analytics and deliver ads. Apple and Android mobile devices each generate a mobile advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in much the same way that cookies are used on websites.\n\n- Third Party Cookies and Pixel Tags: Our websites and services include pixel tags and cookies and mobiles IDs from third parties. In some cases, a third party uses cookies and pixel tags or mobile IDs to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, third parties use cookies and pixel tags or mobile IDs to track interaction with and the effectiveness of content (such as videos, news content) and ads. When your browser connects to a third party’s web server to retrieve content or pixel tags, that third party is able to set or read its own cookies on your device and may use those cookies to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services using those cookies.\n\nBelow is a chart that identifies the third party advertising and analytics providers we use on some or all of the Openfit Services, such as Openfit.com and other sites and apps. The chart also notes their purposes for using your cookie data, and ways you can opt-out of their use of your cookies. This list may change from time to time, and we will take commercially reasonable efforts to keep it current.\n\nCompany/Service\tBusiness or Commercial Purpose(s)\tPrivacy Notices\tManage Settings (opt-out)\nYahoo\tAdvertising\thttps://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.htm\thttps://www.verizonmedia.com/policies/us/en/verizonmedia/privacy/controls/index.html\nSee the industry opt-outs below.\n\nTealium\tAnalytics\thttps://tealium.com/privacy/\thttps://tealium.com/preferences/\nMarin Software\tAdvertising\thttps://www.marinsoftware.com/privacy/privacy-central\thttps://www.marinsoftware.com/privacy/marin-tracker-opt-out\nOptimizely\tAnalytics\thttps://www.optimizely.com/privacy/\thttps://www.optimizely.com/legal/opt-out/\nSteelHouse\tAdvertising\thttps://steelhouse.com/privacy-policy/\thttps://steelhouse.com/opt-out/\nSee the industry opt-outs below.\n\nFuelX\tAdvertising\thttps://fuelx.com/privacy-policy/\tEmail legal@fuelx.com\nHotjar\tAdvertising\thttps://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/privacy\thttps://www.hotjar.com/legal/compliance/opt-out\nGoogle Doubleclick\tAdvertising; Analytics\thttp://www.google.com/policies/privacy/\thttps://policies.google.com/privacy#infochoices;\nhttps://adssettings.google.com/authenticated\n\nSee the industry opt-outs below.\n\nGoogle Adsense; Google Analytics\tAdvertising; Analytics\twww.google.com/policies/privacy/partners\thttps://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout\nSee the industry opt-outs below.\n\nMicrosoft\tAdvertising\thttps://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement\thttps://account.microsoft.com/privacy/ad-settings/signedout?ru=https:%2F%2Faccount.microsoft.com%2Fprivacy%2Fad-settings\nSee the industry opt-outs below.\n\nSnapchat\tAdvertising\thttps://www.snap.com/en-US/privacy/privacy-policy/;\nhttps://www.snap.com/en-US/cookie-policy\n\nhttps://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/advertising-preferences\nFloodlight\tAdvertising\thttps://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites\thttps://adssettings.google.com/authenticated\nPinterest\tAdvertising\thttps://policy.pinterest.com/en/privacy-policy\tSee the industry opt-outs below.\n \n\nTo opt-out from third party collection or use of cookie data, and to learn more about their privacy practices, click on the links above.\n\n- Industry opt-out: Many of these companies are also members of associations, which provide a simple way to opt out of analytics and ad targeting, which you can access at:\n\nUnited States:\nNAI (http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.aspx) and\nDAA (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)\nCanada: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (https://youradchoices.ca/)\n- Browser cookie controls: Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.\n- Pixel Tag Controls: You can disable pixel tags in emails by changing the settings on your email client to prevent the automatic downloading of images.\n- Mobile Ad ID controls: Each operating system provides options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising ID.- Do Not Track Signals: Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Openfit Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.

We share personal information we collect as described below:\n- Third-Party Service Providers: We disclose any of the categories of personal information described in this policy to third party companies and individuals for business purposes performed on our behalf to better serve you. For example, we use third parties to help us make our products and services available to you, fulfill orders you may have placed, process credit card payments, provide customer service, ship postal mail, deliver your packages, conduct market research or information analysis, manage promotions, and contact you in connection with various Openfit Services. In these instances, we may need to provide your information to these third parties for such purposes.\n- Affiliates and Subsidiaries; Openfit Partners; Third Party Offers: Openfit may share your personal information with its affiliates, subsidiaries and parent companies. Openfit occasionally partners with third parties to learn more about our customers so we can service you better or offer products or services that we feel may be useful to you (\"Openfit Partners\"). In such case, we may disclose to a Openfit Partner certain information, such as your contact information (name, email address, phone number, billing or shipping address) and purchase history. If you request information from an Openfit Partner, we may disclose additional information such as your email address, phone number and other contact information, so the Openfit Partner can provide you with the information you requested. If you purchased a product or service from an Openfit Partner, we will also disclose your payment information, such as credit card information so they can complete your purchase. We may disclose aggregated, de-identified information to Openfit Partners: (i) so the Openfit Partners can provide you with advertisements tailored to your interests; (ii) for statistical analysis, research, and demographic profiling purposes; and (iii) to support our business and improve our mission to help our customers achieve their health and wellness goals.\n- Protection of Openfit and Others: We may share your information, including personally identifiable information, in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Openfit, or the legal rights of our customers, business partners, employees, agents, and contractors; (ii) protect the safety and security of our customers, or members of the public, including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) detect and protect against fraud and identity theft or to conduct risk management; (iv) comply with laws, legal process, or legal requests from any governmental or regulatory body; or (v) to enforce or apply our website Terms and Conditions and/or other agreements.\n- De-identified Data Disclosures: We may also disclose non-identifying transaction information to third parties for accounting, record keeping and other purposes. We may also disclose aggregated, de-identified user data or non-personal information with business partners, advertisers, and others.\nWhat About Third-Party and Advertisers’ Services? \n\nAt various points and pages on our websites or mobile applications, you may be able to access or utilize services offered by or in conjunction with third parties. This includes services in connection with third-party \"social media\" and other sites that would allow personal information to be transferred to such third parties (for example, Facebook Connect), and others.\n\nThese third parties have separate data collection and privacy practices independent from ours, so please review their privacy policies to understand your rights. For this reason, Openfit cannot be responsible for their policies or activities. Please contact those third parties directly if you have questions about their privacy practices.\n\nHow Secure is Information About Me?\n\nOpenfit has implemented and uses reasonable security measures designed to help prevent the loss and unauthorized access of your information. Despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or to be absolutely secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or our online services. You can help protect your personal information by not reusing any passwords you use in connection with your Openfit accounts. If you suspect a website or mobile application is pretending to be that of Openfit’s (also known as “spoofing”), do not enter any personal information, but please let us know by emailing CyberIssues@Openfit.com. Personal information may be accessed by persons within our organization, or our third party service providers, who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated above, or such other purposes as may be permitted or required by the applicable law. Personal Information we collect is maintained in the United States.\n\nWhat Happens to My Information if Openfit is Sold to or Merges With Another Company?\n\nAs we continue to develop and grow our business or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, we might sell one or more of our assets, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Customer information may also be disclosed in connection with due diligence or in preparation of a potential sale or investment.\n\nUsers Based Outside of the USA; Transfer of Personal Information\n\nLike most websites and businesses, Openfit’s websites may be accessed by an international audience. By visiting our websites, using our applications, and/or providing us with any data, you agree we may collect, process, use, and store your personal information as discussed herein, outside your resident jurisdiction (such as the U.S. or Canada). Our Openfit Partners and third party service providers may also be located outside of your jurisdiction. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions. Please note that U.S. law and those of other countries where your information may be stored and processed may offer different levels of protection for your information than your home country. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that such personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n\nHow Can I Access or Update My Information?\n\nWe want to be sure your personal information is kept accurate and complete, and for this reason we ask that you inform us in the event of any changes to your information. If you provided your information directly to Openfit, you may access or update certain personal information by visiting the applicable section within your Openfit account. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to your request to access or update your information. Please note that certain access may be subject to a fee.\n\nYour Privacy Choices: Opt-Out\n- Marketing: We offer you various ways to opt-out of receiving certain communications from us.

Your continued business relationship with us, or use of any of our Openfit Services after the changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of any changes, both with regard to information we have previously collected from you and information we may collect from you in the future.\n\nNotices to California Residents\n\nYour California Privacy Rights - California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)\n\nIf you are a California resident and the processing of personal information about you is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), beginning January 2020 you have certain rights with respect to that information.

I have been athletic in the past in my life, and am sort of “skinny fat,” now due to a couple injuries that took me out of the game, AND I was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos syndrome, and have been deconditioning and living with pain, plus working FT and raising my 4 kids. Since starting it Saturday, I have already noticed a HUGE difference! (It’s Wednesday). I tend to build muscle quickly but this is amazing. Several people have already been commenting, asking what’s different. \n\nI can feel new muscles in my glutes, my quads, my hamstrings, I have arm definition, and even my ABS are getting defined after 4 babies. I am forcing my husband to download the app, because there’s literally something for everyone! I feel motivated, and being able to do a different video every day, or more than one, plus getting to choose the time, helps to make sure I go back to it every time. The notifications aren’t even annoying, and I can set when they send them! Lol\n\nI’ve done the X-Tend Barre almost every day (it’s HARD, but an amazing workout and you can always modify), then I’ve added some Pilates and recovery yoga in there. Best app I’ve ever tried for guided exercise! And the Barre instructor is amazing. Super motivating and has tons of incredible little tips the whole time to make sure you’re doing everything correctly. 5/5! (No I was not paid for this, I’m just super happy, lol).","title":"BEST PROGRAM EVER, even w/Chronic Pain!

You should LOVE your workouts! This keeps me on track and keeps my workouts done in timely manner. \nI love the yoga! I finally found an online option that challenges me! I’ve been a yogi for 3 years without following classes and the yoga52 program has challenged my strength, balance \u0026 flexibility in ways I never have before. \nI do the xbbarre, yoga \u0026 Pilates. \nOnly thing I would change would be having longer barre classes, full body/cardio ones like an hour long that are truly hard to complete. Burn out everyyy muscle group. For the ones who are already advanced. Right now I’ll take 2-3 different barre classes/day or repeat some to get the full burn.","title":"Fitness journey game changer -professional fashion model","userName":"Jae-Danette"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6467185957","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-25T14:29:50Z","developerResponse":{"id":18633810,"body":"Wow, we're so happy that you decided to take the plunge and get an Openfit membership!

I finally did yesterday and I have to say, it more than surpassed my expectations!! I love group classes because I’m not super social but I love being around people; it’s weird but I think people can relate. Although I love work out classes it has been years since I last went to one because I have children, work and school obligations that impede me from committing to same time classes . These feel like real life clases because there is always a coach cheering you on and checking your form and technique . You can hear comments to others participants, it’s super Interactive and honestly my favorite thing.  I am still on the 14 day feee trial but I am no doubt buying the annual .

At home, at the gym (hello Winter and dreadmill season), and on vacation. \n\nI absolutely love the LIVE coaches. They are super supportive and encourage me to go push myself. They have also been there with modifications when I’ve had to work through injuries. I never feel like I can’t do a class when I can’t do an exercise.

As a working mom I needed something I could do wherever whenever and had a variety of options so this seemed like a great fit. Plus the “quarterly” fee was reasonable. I submitted my card information, and downloaded the app excited to get in. I also downloaded the app in my smart TV. After about 45 mins of trying to get the apps to work, each time I signed in it would want me to enroll or sign up for a subscription (i already had) I tried finding a customer service number but there wasn’t one - email only. I submitted a request twice just to have someone tell me to delete the app then download again. After 3 days of trying to get going I was frustrate and done. I quickly logged back in to cancel my subscription (because forget it no one will even help you) and it was still telling me to sign up (again, i already had) so i emailed again customer service and they told me there was no subscription. Great. Oh no . A month later $39 charge. Here we go. Emailed again because you can’t call anyone just to be told i don’t have a subscription. I was just charged again a second time . $39.

However, the “live” classes are nothing like having a live class instructor. The classes are rote and perfunctory, with video of someone demonstrating each singular exercise, while the live instructor peers in at you to tell you whether or not you’re doing a great job. Kickboxing was not a fun and dynamic class. It felt like it was geared more towards exhibitionists who enjoy the machines at the gym. For this reason, I think I may actually enjoy the taped classes more than the live classes. The second potential drawback is that despite having an app on Roku, you cannot view your live classes there. I was initially upset; but, now that I will be using mainly taped classes, it doesn’t really matter. At minimum, this app will get me through the pandemic. But, I foresee a return to the gym, in my future. The gym is fun because it is social, (at least it is with classes), and this app is not able to compete with that element. At best, this app will complement my gym attendance, post-pandemic.","title":"It’s Ok","userName":"Mzsmart"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6154566996","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-04T01:36:53Z","developerResponse":{"id":16419180,"body":"Hi FAWhitehead -- You should see a button on your home screen \"See Future Workouts\".

Andrea Rogers’ Xtend Barre and XB Pilates are miracle workouts for dancers (and non dancers) for building and maintaining healthy, strong, mobile back, hips and core. My only real issue (but it’s a big one for me) is that the app does not have a place (or a tab really) where I can see all the Live Streamed Classes that I’m signed up for 😕. This is incredibly disappointing since scrolling through EVERY workout (which is a lot which is why they’re awesome) making sure I didn’t forget to put one in my planner is sooooo time consuming. The app should really have a place that keeps track of that for the user who pays for their subscription. I understand how it might not be included in a free trial but if you want me to keep doing the Live classes, let me see the ones I’m already signed up for so I can plan them in advance and not miss them because they are lost among all of the other classes and times on the app. It’s too many and the same class is often offered multiple different times a day.

I love working out and have tried so many! I always chose the subscription options that include the 14-day or so free trial, because they can be expensive and I am picky about my workout programs. So, I downloaded the app, made an account and choose the option for the year subscription, because it came with a 14-day trial. I started using the app and didn’t love it, so I had plans of canceling my subscription well before the 14-day trial ended! Well within hours of choosing that subscription, I was charged the 100 or so dollars for the whole year subscription. I reached out to customer service about the issue, wanting my money back, because I technically was supposed to have a 14-day trial! They claimed that the 14-day trial was only if I signed up online! They even set me their official prices page! What? The app clearly showed that a 14-day trial would be included! I feel like it is deceiving and not totally honest! I have dealt with so many apps and definitely know how the trial basis works! So, if you plan on taking advantage of the 14-day trial, DO NOT DO SO ON THE APP!!!!!!!!!!!

I tried to get the full experience and try other parts of the app. The other programs offered are great! However, I was not super impressed with the live classes that occurred because the structure of how it was executed was not at all what I thought it would be. Openfit should look into having the instructors actually do the workouts rather than just insert clips of said exercises. The live workouts also severely lacked the live portion in my opinion, it felt less personal and more generated.\n\nI had also seen a comment on how the trainers are not nationally credited instructors which definitely needs to be changed. I work in a gym so I am surrounded by fitness all day as well as workout nearly every day.

So impressed with this app. I feel like crying. I have gained so much weight since our lock downs. I saw a friend once who used her phone while lifting weights and I would think of that periodically. Last night I was literally on the web looking for an app and low and behold at work a random person I started a conversation with told me about this app she started using to encourage walking. I hadn’t even bright it up to her. Wow, the universe works in mysterious ways. I downloaded this after work and decided to join a trivia walk with Jennifer E (I think) and it was absolutely amazing!
