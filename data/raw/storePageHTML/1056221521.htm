      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>And once again we have a completely new function for you: with this update, all myatmo &#39;Premium&#39; users receive &#39;3-year statistics&#39; with information on how often certain temperature ranges and other meteorologically or climatologically significant daily values ​​in the last three years were achieved.<br /><br />• New: 3-year statistics<br /><br />Can be called up via the main menu on the side of the overview screen.<br /><br />Here you can compare how often the following daily values ​​have been achieved over the last three years: summer days, hot days, desert days, tropical nights, heating days, vegetation days, frost days, ice days, rainy days and storm days. How these different days are defined is explained in the new &#39;3-year statistics&#39;.<br /><br />Mentioned values ​​can be displayed and compared in a special diagram for the last 3 years. myatmo offers both a bar chart and a radial chart for this purpose. As always, individual values ​​can be deactivated by tapping the diagram legend, for example to compare only the number of summer days within a three-year period.<br /><br />myatmo users without &#39;premium status&#39; can only use the new function for the last three years, all other users can scroll back through the years and thus view the last three years of any year.<br /><br />In addition, this update also contains the usual minor bug fixes, updated components and a few performance improvements</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been using Netatmo products for about 5 years now and love them very much.  I’ve two  indoor temp/humidity sensors, one outside, and both a wind and rain sensors.  The amount of data the gather is great and fun to watch. But, in all of Netatmo’s wisdom they forgot to write equally useful App for iPads and iPhones. Their App is clunky to get around in and impossible to view all of their products sensor information at once. <br />This is where Myatmo comes into play. I his is the App Netatmo should have built. As soon as you open up the App and login to your Netatmo account you’re shown all of your sensor data on one very thought out screen.  The screen is very colorful and easy to look at with current sensor data n the left and graphs on the right. You can simply scroll down the list of your devices to view their data, not pull each own down from a pop up menu like Netatmo makes you do.  The weather forecast for your area is always displayed at the bottom of the screen making it easy to view at a glance. <br />Very nice App indeed and a big thank you to the makers of!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>For starters, I have been a Netatmo user for years.  Even before HomeKit, I used netatmo for my temperature tracking.  This is helpful in unpredictable climates as well as when it comes to how much time my dogs or kids spend outside.  I love netatmo’s products but their app leaves something to be desired.  It is great if you just want current temp, but if you’re a stats geek like me, you like to know how things like temp and rainfall, and humidity compare to previous months and years.<br /><br />Myatmo does exactly that and is a fantastic app, I would go so far as saying delete your netatmo app and commit to myatmo.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Loved this app for several years. It is the app that Netamo should have made, etc. <br /><br />Please stop with the pop-up notifications that there is a new version available in the App Store. For the love of God. No other apps do this to that extent. There seems to be no way to turn that off without just disabling notifications entirely for the app which I will do. It’s starting to get pretty obnoxious and totally unnecessary, when iOS by default automatically updates apps in the background. Also, would love for slightly better localization, so that dates for example can be in the US format, rather than European. <br /><br />Otherwise, it rocks</p>

once again we have a completely new function for you: with this update, all myatmo 'Premium' users receive '3-year statistics' with information on how often certain temperature ranges and other meteorologically or climatologically significant daily values ​​in the last three years were achieved.\n\n• New: 3-year statistics\n\nCan be called up via the main menu on the side of the overview screen.\n\nHere you can compare how often the following daily values ​​have been achieved over the last three years: summer days, hot days, desert days, tropical nights, heating days, vegetation days, frost days, ice days, rainy days and storm days. How these different days are defined is explained in the new '3-year statistics'.\n\nMentioned values ​​can be displayed and compared in a special diagram for the last 3 years. myatmo offers both a bar chart and a radial chart for this purpose. As always, individual values ​​can be deactivated by tapping the diagram legend, for example to compare only the number of summer days within a three-year period.\n\nmyatmo users without 'premium status' can only use the new function for the last three years, all other users can scroll back through the years and thus view the last three years of any year.\n\nIn addition, this update also contains the usual minor bug fixes, updated components and a few performance improvements","releaseDate":"2021-03-05"},{"versionDisplay":"4.2.11","releaseNotes":"Performance optimizations and minor corrections!

As soon as this option has been activated, areas in the diagrams of the landscape view can be marked with just one finger by swiping and then automatically zoomed. Please note: this new function is deactivated by default, as it has a negative side effect: a simple swiping through a diagram in order to be able to understand all values ​​via the tooltip is still possible, but the diagram is zoomed after the swiping gesture is ended. So if you generally zoom a lot in diagrams, you can activate this option and test it. If you still prefer to zoom with two fingers, you can leave this option deactivated\n• Improved: Various optimizations, bug fixes and performance improvements within the diagram engine","releaseDate":"2021-02-13"},{"versionDisplay":"4.2.9","releaseNotes":"We have further optimized myatmo for you and tweaked various screws:\n\n• New: the cumulative precipitation diagram now shows (if the comparison includes the current year) the total amount of precipitation compared to the same day of the previous year. This makes the sum comparison over the course of a year more meaningful. When comparing two years that have already been completed, this option is of course not available and the total amount here refers to December 31st every year\n• Improved: we have moved the marker for more than 20 liters of rain on one day to the X-axis (Y-axis: 0 position) in order to improve the general readability of the cumulative precipitation diagram\n• Changed: if the system language was 'Swiss German', myatmo started in English.

Various performance optimizations have been made in all widgets.\n\nPlease also note: It is no longer possible to create a station name for your weather station. We have mentioned this several times in the past. netatmo is restructuring the entire system into a 'house-based' system - apparently no need was seen for freely adjustable station names ... What a shame, because unfortunately this does not meet the wishes of many weather station owners. Anyway ...\n\nYou may have already noticed: netatmo now supplies the house name followed by the name of the main module (in brackets) as the station name of your weather station. The house name and the name of the main module can be specified by you in the settings of your netatmo weather station. Unfortunately, the combination of both can be relatively long and cannot be shown in myatmo without being shortened.\n\nSince we saw this problem coming, the new 'alias station name' function has recently been available in myatmo, which can be accessed via the main menu on the main screen. Here you can quickly and easily create a new alias station name, which then bypasses the restrictions of the netatmo house and main module names. The myatmo 'alias station name' is of course only visible within myatmo and has no influence on your naming in the settings of your netatmo weather station.

More on this below.\n\n• New weather forecast bar data supplier\n\nAs previously mentioned in the 'Update News' and also in myatmo itself, Apple took over the DarkSky service, from which we obtained weather forecast data, at the end of March 2020 and then announced that the data service will be discontinued at the end of 2021. So there were only two options for the weather forecast built into myatmo: the weather forecast bar would also be discontinued at the end of 2021 (which we didn't really want to do), or a new provider of weather data had to be found that would provide comparable performance for a comparable price.\n\nThere are very few free weather data services, but they don't provide particularly good global data quality and coverage; on the other hand, there are paid services that provide good forecasts for pretty much every point on earth. And we have now integrated one of these into myatmo! The structure of the data is ideal for myatmo and the entire service is perfect: fast, accurate and very high-resolution in terms of coverage. Hourly updated weather forecasts for the next 7 days for the location of your netatmo weather station! Included in myatmo 'Premium' at no additional cost for you!\n\nThe weather forecast bar is now activated by default, but can be deactivated in the myatmo settings. Users without myatmo 'Premium' can test the bar for 3 days. After this test phase, no more current forecasts are loaded and displayed for 'non-myatmo Premium' users.\n\nPlease note that the geographic location of your weather station must be correctly set in the settings of your netatmo weather station so that myatmo can call up weather forecast data for the correct location. How you can determine the location of your weather station is explained at support.netatmo.com.\n\n• New: Global weather maps\n\nWe can now offer you global weather maps with our new weather data provider: you can view temperature, air pressure, wind, precipitation and cloud cover on a world map: the data is available worldwide, maps can be zoomed and you will be informed to the max via the corresponding map legend.\n\nThe 'Global Weather Map' can be accessed via the main menu on the myatmo main screen and is available free of charge to all myatmo 'Premium' users. Users without myatmo 'Premium' can only use the temperature map. Air pressure, wind, precipitation and cloud cover are only accessible to myatmo 'Premium' users. With the 'Global Weather Map' we complete and supplement our map features: with the stations map, the netatmo map and the new global weather map, you now have a total overview, both regionally and globally!\n\nSo much for the new features.

Many thanks also to the many new 'Premium' users in the past few weeks! :o)\n\nPlease note the following: myatmo widgets update at a random interval within a reasonable period of time. Very short intervals make little sense, because your weather station only sends measurement data to the netatmo server every 10 to a maximum of 15 minutes. iOS then decides independently when a widget is to be supplied with new data. This happens within a 15-45 minute interval. This ensures that widgets always display the latest data from the last 30 to 60 minutes and that these update intervals do not flood or overload the netatmo data server with constant data queries. If you really want to see the very last measured values that your station has transmitted to the netatmo data server, then the myatmo iOS app can be started, which then provides you with the last available measured values.\n\nFor more than two years we have been providing all 'Premium' users with extensions to myatmo, with new diagrams, with the rapid implementation of new iOS features and much more, such as the quick solution of the 'station name problem', as explained several times in the previous news.

Please note that this does not affect system UI elements and any related feedback (switches etc.)\n• Various layout optimizations\n• Minor bug fixes and performance optimizations\n\nAnd now our solution to the 'station name problem':\n\nThe 'station name problem', which we have already addressed several times in the news of the previous versions, has moved us to integrate our own 'alias name system' into myatmo. Here are the details:\n\nAs mentioned before, it is currently not possible to define a station name via the netatmo weather station configuration. netatmo is currently converting the entire system to a 'house module system' in which there will no longer be any weather stations that can be identified by their own name. Instead there is only one 'house' and one (or more) weather station linked to this house, which however no longer has its own name, or whose previously defined name can no longer be changed by the user. This creates a couple of problems that we now want to solve with our own 'alias name system':\n\nYou can now use the main menu at the top left of the myatmo main screen to set an 'alias station name'. This name then serves as the name of your weather station within myatmo and all other myatmo components. The 'alias station name' is NOT transferred to your netatmo weather station settings. It is only valid and visible within myatmo. Please note that after you have specified an 'alias station name', it may not be available until the next data update in widgets and the watch app. Especially the watch app might need a few refreshes before the alias name appears there. It may also be necessary to reconfigure the widget settings to make the new 'alias station name' visible in widgets. 'Alias ​​station names' are transferred via the iCloud to your other devices on which myatmo is also running. This might take a moment to complete.\n\nWith this workaround, we hope to let you bypass the current restrictions of the netatmo system in terms of naming, at least in myatmo. If you have any further questions regarding the migration of your netatmo weather station into the new 'house concept': netatmo has set up some FAQ for this, which you can reach via\n\nhttps://cutt.ly/netatmo-migration\n\nIf you have any further questions regarding the migration, you will find a corresponding contact option at the end of each FAQ on the website mentioned.","releaseDate":"2020-10-12"},{"versionDisplay":"4.0.3","releaseNotes":"Widget Party Part 4? No, this time 'just' a small interim update :o) *** Please read below for an update on the 'station name problem' ***\n\n• New: the difference to the previous day is now displayed in the large widget for sunrise and sunset times\n• Various fixes and minor improvements\n\nOnce again a few words on the problem of changing the name of your weather station:\n\nAs mentioned before, after netatmo has made significant changes to the configuration websites for your weather station, it is currently not possible to assign a name to a weather station or to change an already existing one. The whole thing is actually intended by netatmo, because they want to switch to a 'house-module-system' in which there are no longer separate weather stations, but only a sum of modules within a house. All of this can be summarized under the name 'Smarthome' and your netatmo weather stations should now be integrated as part of a larger whole, regardless of whether you have other netatmo 'Smarthome' devices or not.\n\nSo, what now? It is planned that your 'old' station name will soon be replaced by a combination of 'House' and 'Name of the main module' of the netatmo weather station or just the name of the main module. We were told that by netatmo. An option to freely set a name only for your weather station (as it was possible before) is no longer possible and a revival of such a function is not planned (at least currently) on netatmo's side. We still hope that netatmo realizes that this has been planned in the wrong direction. With the best will in the world, we cannot say whether there will really be insight.\n\nAfter we had discussed the whole thing with some myatmo users and had to realize that netatmos ideas really do not correspond to what weather station owners want, we decided to develop our own 'station name alias' system and integrate it into myatmo, so that you can do it you can still flexibly name your weather station as YOU want, at least within myatmo.\n\nWe will try to provide you with the next update, which will solve the station name chaos at least within myatmo, as soon as possible.

Of course there are some who do not have a rain gauge or anemometer - understandable, because not everyone has the ability to fit these devices properly. Many also have no additional indoor modules.\n\nIt is in the nature of things that parts of some widgets then of course remain empty, but with a total of 10 (!) different widgets we have now covered almost all possible device configurations and pretty much each of you should find at least one widget that suits your needs and wishes.

I’ve two  indoor temp/humidity sensors, one outside, and both a wind and rain sensors.  The amount of data the gather is great and fun to watch. But, in all of Netatmo’s wisdom they forgot to write equally useful App for iPads and iPhones. Their App is clunky to get around in and impossible to view all of their products sensor information at once. \nThis is where Myatmo comes into play. I his is the App Netatmo should have built. As soon as you open up the App and login to your Netatmo account you’re shown all of your sensor data on one very thought out screen.  The screen is very colorful and easy to look at with current sensor data n the left and graphs on the right. You can simply scroll down the list of your devices to view their data, not pull each own down from a pop up menu like Netatmo makes you do.  The weather forecast for your area is always displayed at the bottom of the screen making it easy to view at a glance. \nVery nice App indeed and a big thank you to the makers of!","title":"The App Netatmo should have made","userName":"mdpaxton"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2838382743","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-07-05T00:07:49Z","rating":5,"review":"For starters, I have been a Netatmo user for years.  Even before HomeKit, I used netatmo for my temperature tracking.  This is helpful in unpredictable climates as well as when it comes to how much time my dogs or kids spend outside.  I love netatmo’s products but their app leaves something to be desired.  It is great if you just want current temp, but if you’re a stats geek like me, you like to know how things like temp and rainfall, and humidity compare to previous months and years.\n\nMyatmo does exactly that and is a fantastic app, I would go so far as saying delete your netatmo app and commit to myatmo.","title":"A Smart Home Owners’ Must Have App!","userName":"therrk"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6838140760","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-01-06T16:08:06Z","rating":4,"review":"Loved this app for several years. It is the app that Netamo should have made, etc. \n\nPlease stop with the pop-up notifications that there is a new version available in the App Store. For the love of God. No other apps do this to that extent. There seems to be no way to turn that off without just disabling notifications entirely for the app which I will do. It’s starting to get pretty obnoxious and totally unnecessary, when iOS by default automatically updates apps in the background. Also, would love for slightly better localization, so that dates for example can be in the US format, rather than European. \n\nOtherwise, it rocks","title":"Stop the notifications","userName":"jrpg8255"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6418283859","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-11T14:59:44Z","rating":5,"review":"Myatmo has made my use of Netatmo hardware far better.  I’m grateful to have it in my never-ending desire to keep my home’s CO2 level down.\n\nMy only qualm — and it’s with the Netatmo data, but myatmo could pave over it — is that stray 0 values skew the data set. It would be worth checking for out of bounds conditions and rejecting data that simply isn’t possible.

Just be prepared to memorize all the tiny icons or symbols representing the different measurements as there are few labels in the app. The app is also very slow loading and retrieving the station data (even with a fast connection). It does not appear to do background data updating. My Weather Underground apps are much faster at retrieving my weather station data and I use them for faster checks on the current weather and forecasts.

Please note: this new function is deactivated by default, as it has a negative side effect: a simple swiping through a diagram in order to be able to understand all values ​​via the tooltip is still possible, but the diagram is zoomed after the swiping gesture is ended. So if you generally zoom a lot in diagrams, you can activate this option and test it.

Various performance optimizations have been made in all widgets.\n\nPlease also note: It is no longer possible to create a station name for your weather station. We have mentioned this several times in the past. netatmo is restructuring the entire system into a 'house-based' system - apparently no need was seen for freely adjustable station names ... What a shame, because unfortunately this does not meet the wishes of many weather station owners. Anyway ...\n\nYou may have already noticed: netatmo now supplies the house name followed by the name of the main module (in brackets) as the station name of your weather station. The house name and the name of the main module can be specified by you in the settings of your netatmo weather station. Unfortunately, the combination of both can be relatively long and cannot be shown in myatmo without being shortened.\n\nSince we saw this problem coming, the new 'alias station name' function has recently been available in myatmo, which can be accessed via the main menu on the main screen. Here you can quickly and easily create a new alias station name, which then bypasses the restrictions of the netatmo house and main module names.

More on this below.\n\n• New weather forecast bar data supplier\n\nAs previously mentioned in the 'Update News' and also in myatmo itself, Apple took over the DarkSky service, from which we obtained weather forecast data, at the end of March 2020 and then announced that the data service will be discontinued at the end of 2021. So there were only two options for the weather forecast built into myatmo: the weather forecast bar would also be discontinued at the end of 2021 (which we didn't really want to do), or a new provider of weather data had to be found that would provide comparable performance for a comparable price.\n\nThere are very few free weather data services, but they don't provide particularly good global data quality and coverage; on the other hand, there are paid services that provide good forecasts for pretty much every point on earth. And we have now integrated one of these into myatmo! The structure of the data is ideal for myatmo and the entire service is perfect: fast, accurate and very high-resolution in terms of coverage. Hourly updated weather forecasts for the next 7 days for the location of your netatmo weather station! Included in myatmo 'Premium' at no additional cost for you!\n\nThe weather forecast bar is now activated by default, but can be deactivated in the myatmo settings. Users without myatmo 'Premium' can test the bar for 3 days. After this test phase, no more current forecasts are loaded and displayed for 'non-myatmo Premium' users.\n\nPlease note that the geographic location of your weather station must be correctly set in the settings of your netatmo weather station so that myatmo can call up weather forecast data for the correct location. How you can determine the location of your weather station is explained at support.netatmo.com.\n\n• New: Global weather maps\n\nWe can now offer you global weather maps with our new weather data provider: you can view temperature, air pressure, wind, precipitation and cloud cover on a world map: the data is available worldwide, maps can be zoomed and you will be informed to the max via the corresponding map legend.\n\nThe 'Global Weather Map' can be accessed via the main menu on the myatmo main screen and is available free of charge to all myatmo 'Premium' users. Users without myatmo 'Premium' can only use the temperature map. Air pressure, wind, precipitation and cloud cover are only accessible to myatmo 'Premium' users. With the 'Global Weather Map' we complete and supplement our map features: with the stations map, the netatmo map and the new global weather map, you now have a total overview, both regionally and globally!\n\nSo much for the new features.

However, according to the developer documentation, Apple has marked 'Today Widgets' as 'deprecated' (which means: 'outdated technology') and these will no longer be supported at some point in a future iOS version.\n\nIt is known (and not only with regard to the myatmo 'Today Widget') that old 'Today Widgets' of various apps on iOS 13 show problems and may no longer work correctly.

Many thanks also to the many new 'Premium' users in the past few weeks! :o)\n\nPlease note the following: myatmo widgets update at a random interval within a reasonable period of time. Very short intervals make little sense, because your weather station only sends measurement data to the netatmo server every 10 to a maximum of 15 minutes. iOS then decides independently when a widget is to be supplied with new data. This happens within a 15-45 minute interval. This ensures that widgets always display the latest data from the last 30 to 60 minutes and that these update intervals do not flood or overload the netatmo data server with constant data queries. If you really want to see the very last measured values that your station has transmitted to the netatmo data server, then the myatmo iOS app can be started, which then provides you with the last available measured values.\n\nFor more than two years we have been providing all 'Premium' users with extensions to myatmo, with new diagrams, with the rapid implementation of new iOS features and much more, such as the quick solution of the 'station name problem', as explained several times in the previous news.

All together in one large widget.

Please note that this does not affect system UI elements and any related feedback (switches etc.)\n• Various layout optimizations\n• Minor bug fixes and performance optimizations\n\nAnd now our solution to the 'station name problem':\n\nThe 'station name problem', which we have already addressed several times in the news of the previous versions, has moved us to integrate our own 'alias name system' into myatmo. Here are the details:\n\nAs mentioned before, it is currently not possible to define a station name via the netatmo weather station configuration. netatmo is currently converting the entire system to a 'house module system' in which there will no longer be any weather stations that can be identified by their own name. Instead there is only one 'house' and one (or more) weather station linked to this house, which however no longer has its own name, or whose previously defined name can no longer be changed by the user. This creates a couple of problems that we now want to solve with our own 'alias name system':\n\nYou can now use the main menu at the top left of the myatmo main screen to set an 'alias station name'. This name then serves as the name of your weather station within myatmo and all other myatmo components. The 'alias station name' is NOT transferred to your netatmo weather station settings. It is only valid and visible within myatmo. Please note that after you have specified an 'alias station name', it may not be available until the next data update in widgets and the watch app. Especially the watch app might need a few refreshes before the alias name appears there. It may also be necessary to reconfigure the widget settings to make the new 'alias station name' visible in widgets. 'Alias ​​station names' are transferred via the iCloud to your other devices on which myatmo is also running. This might take a moment to complete.\n\nWith this workaround, we hope to let you bypass the current restrictions of the netatmo system in terms of naming, at least in myatmo. If you have any further questions regarding the migration of your netatmo weather station into the new 'house concept': netatmo has set up some FAQ for this, which you can reach via\n\nhttps://cutt.ly/netatmo-migration\n\nIf you have any further questions regarding the migration, you will find a corresponding contact option at the end of each FAQ on the website mentioned.","releaseDate":"2020-10-12"},{"versionDisplay":"4.0.3","releaseNotes":"Widget Party Part 4? No, this time 'just' a small interim update :o) *** Please read below for an update on the 'station name problem' ***\n\n• New: the difference to the previous day is now displayed in the large widget for sunrise and sunset times\n• Various fixes and minor improvements\n\nOnce again a few words on the problem of changing the name of your weather station:\n\nAs mentioned before, after netatmo has made significant changes to the configuration websites for your weather station, it is currently not possible to assign a name to a weather station or to change an already existing one. The whole thing is actually intended by netatmo, because they want to switch to a 'house-module-system' in which there are no longer separate weather stations, but only a sum of modules within a house. All of this can be summarized under the name 'Smarthome' and your netatmo weather stations should now be integrated as part of a larger whole, regardless of whether you have other netatmo 'Smarthome' devices or not.\n\nSo, what now? It is planned that your 'old' station name will soon be replaced by a combination of 'House' and 'Name of the main module' of the netatmo weather station or just the name of the main module. We were told that by netatmo. An option to freely set a name only for your weather station (as it was possible before) is no longer possible and a revival of such a function is not planned (at least currently) on netatmo's side. We still hope that netatmo realizes that this has been planned in the wrong direction. With the best will in the world, we cannot say whether there will really be insight.\n\nAfter we had discussed the whole thing with some myatmo users and had to realize that netatmos ideas really do not correspond to what weather station owners want, we decided to develop our own 'station name alias' system and integrate it into myatmo, so that you can do it you can still flexibly name your weather station as YOU want, at least within myatmo.\n\nWe will try to provide you with the next update, which will solve the station name chaos at least within myatmo, as soon as possible. Thank you very much for your patience.","releaseDate":"2020-10-06"},{"versionDisplay":"4.0.2","releaseNotes":"Widget Party Part 3: here are two widgets for additional indoor modules!\n\nA few words about the design of all new widgets: many myatmo users are 'fully equipped', i.e. they have all available modules for the netatmo weather station. Of course there are some who do not have a rain gauge or anemometer - understandable, because not everyone has the ability to fit these devices properly. Many also have no additional indoor modules.\n\nIt is in the nature of things that parts of some widgets then of course remain empty, but with a total of 10 (!) different widgets we have now covered almost all possible device configurations and pretty much each of you should find at least one widget that suits your needs and wishes. We always like to say it, because there is simply no better way to express it: \"Even the best wind can't please every ship\".\n\nWith this update, all widgets can be tested again by 'non-premium' users for a day and the new widgets that came with v4.0.1 and v4.0.2 can also be tried again.\n\nOnce again on the problem of changing the name of your weather station: as mentioned before, after netatmo has made significant changes to the configuration websites for your weather station, it is currently not possible to change the name of a weather station in such a way that third-party apps such as myatmo receive the updated name via the data interface. Netatmo is aware of the problem and after being asked for our opinion on how the whole thing can ideally be solved, we made two suggestions to netatmo. Due to various technical restructuring, there is probably no quick solution in sight. We will keep you up to date.\n\nThis version also contains some minor bug fixes, updated components and performance optimizations.","releaseDate":"2020-10-03"},{"versionDisplay":"4.0.1","releaseNotes":"*** PLEASE READ COMPLETELY UNTIL THE END - THANK YOU! ***\n\nNews for v4.0.1:\n\n• Four more new widgets for iOS 14 - in total there are now 7 widgets that cover (almost) all wishes\n• Improved handling of potential errors in data preparation in widgets\n\nNews for v4.0.0:\n\nmyatmo v4 is here, for all myatmo 'Premium' users with great widgets for iOS 14 and lots of detail improvements and optimizations!\n\n• New: Three home screen widgets for iOS 14 - and that is just the beginning: four additional widgets are in development and will come soon!\n\nATTENTION: in order to use the widgets, myatmo MUST (!) be started once after the update, as the required configurations are only then made available to the widgets! Please also note: all 'non-myatmo premium users' can test the widgets for one day - afterwards the widgets screen for 'non-myatmo premium users' is deactivated. A myatmo 'Premium' purchase reactivates the widgets.\n\nIn the widgets, depending on the widget size and equipment of your netatmo weather station, the most important measured values ​​as well as various additionally calculated values ​​are displayed for a perfect and, above all, quick overview. With a long press on a widget it can be adjusted: units can be shown / hidden, if you have more than one netatmo weather station, then you can create several widgets for up to 10 stations and even stack them by dragging widgets of the same size onto one another. With the widgets, Apple has really introduced a great new feature in iOS, which we will of course support for you with myatmo! We will soon be offering you more specialized widgets - development is already underway!\n\nThen this version contains a huge number (!) of detailed improvements, which we cannot list all individually here. The most important at a glance:\n\n• New: in the module overview we have added a green line to mark the current day for the rain gauge diagram in the month view\n• Improved: various memory optimizations and again optimized data updates\n• Improved: updated diagram engine with an extremely large number of improvements and optimizations\n• Performance improvements and minor bug fixes\n\nWith this version we are giving up support for iOS 11 and WatchOS 5. All users who are still dependent on iOS 11 will automatically be offered myatmo v3.3.7 for download through the App Store, but updates are no longer provided for iOS 11 and below. The reasons for this are of a technical nature: new technologies in current iOS versions require that we make a cut at some point, work into the future and leave the ballast of old iOS versions and the necessary compatibility adjustments behind us. The suspension of iOS 11 support only affects a very small number of myatmo users.\n\nPlease note another important note regarding a problem with data delivery via the netatmo data server: since netatmo recently revised the settings page for the netatmo weather station, the name of a weather station is no longer delivered to third-party apps such as myatmo after it has been changed. This is clearly a bug in the system that has already been reported and discussed in the official netatmo forum. So don't be surprised if myatmo shows an old weather station name (or no name at all), even if you have already changed the name several times. The problem has to be fixed by netatmo - our hands are tied here. We have informed netatmo accordingly and hope that the problem will be fixed soon. A quick solution is probably not in sight here, we have already learned that much.","releaseDate":"2020-10-02"},{"versionDisplay":"4.0.0","releaseNotes":"myatmo v4 is here, for all myatmo 'Premium' users with great widgets for iOS 14 and lots of detail improvements and optimizations!\n\n• New: Three home screen widgets for iOS 14 - and that is just the beginning: four additional widgets are in development and will come soon!\n\nATTENTION: in order to use the widgets, myatmo MUST (!) be started once after the update, as the required configurations are only then made available to the widgets!

In rare cases, there were problems with users for whom, for whatever reason (we just have no insight into the data server), no or incorrect senseless quantities were reported.\n\nFurthermore:\n\n• Various code optimizations and performance improvements, especially during data refresh\n\nHere we have combined various areas and have thus been able to further improve the speed of data updates. However, it should go without saying that ultimately the Internet and netatmo server speed are decisive for good performance. myatmo calls up a huge amount (!) of data from the netatmo data server in order to generate overview diagrams and to calculate interdependent values. Depending on how many modules are connected to your netatmo weather station, up to 8 requests are sent to the netatmo data server, all of which must be pre-processed and, above all, structured and finalized (both on the server side and on the myatmo side) - this is just for information, so that you get an idea of ​​what is going on in the background during a data update. The myamto data update is therefore not comparable with a simple query of the current measured values ​​of your station.\n\n• Three small memory leaks that had crept in in one of the previous updates were patched and sealed until it stopped dripping :o)\n• Updated frameworks and components\n• Minor bug fixes","releaseDate":"2020-09-12"}],"languageList":["English","Dutch","French","German","Italian","Polish","Spanish"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"privacyPolicyUrl":"https://www.myatmo.de/knowledgebase.php?article=80","requirementsString":"Requires iOS 12.0 and watchOS 5.0 or later.
