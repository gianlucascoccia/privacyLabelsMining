      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The GCP is a powerful and effective tool that has provided my entire family members ranging from ages 6-80 with wealth of information from multiple fascinating lectures. <br />I have enjoyed many courses from History to Astrophysics to cooking and more. The lectures are engaging and easy to follow (English is my second language).  <br />I appreciate the fact that I can log in from any device (10 in my account) and from anywhere in the wold! I can execute multiple daily tasks while learning. Getting stuck in traffic is no longer a waste of my life as long as I can listen to any of The Great Courses Plus lectures. <br />The only thing I wish can be improve, is the accessibility of the lessons in each Course. It takes too many steps of I want to start from the beginning or play a previously studied lesson.  In any case, the fact that one can have access to such incredible amount of knowledge at his/her fingertips is powerful!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Sometimes it doesn’t sync properly across devices, starting further back in a lecture than where you left off - and sometimes you can’t even fast forward to where you were; it just keeps jumping back, forcing you to re-watch parts you’ve already heard.  You can’t download just the audio, only video, which is not too convenient if you are listening while driving unless you want to get a ticket for watching video while driving, because you can’t switch the downloaded video to audio only.   Exit the app and when you go back you have to navigate back manually to where you left off, it does not automatically show the lecture you were on and offer to continue.  It doesn’t even have the course you are on on the front page when the app opens. If you exit the app while watching a video to, say, read a message or google something, it stops playing; you have to manually switch to audio only then exit the app to keep listening.  So, several frustrating clunky inconveniences or bugs, but I’m enjoying the content of my first course.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app is great and functions well, apart from two issues: first, it does not allow audio-only downloads. Since I listen to courses primarily at work, where I have spotty cell reception, streaming isn’t an option, and since video stops playing if you exit the app or turn the screen off, I have to listen with my phone unlocked all day, which is not great for my battery life. Second, when I listen to the app it takes over the mini audio controller in the command center on my iPhone, even after I’ve started listening to music or podcasts. I have to restart the phone to get the correct audio source to display again. This also means that features like pausing without having to manually open and go into the appropriate app don’t work properly, whether I’m trying to do it from the lock screen, the command center, or headphone controls. Apart from those issues though, the app works very well, and I’m enjoying listening to lectures a lot.</p>

For example, we may aggregate non-personal information about you and other customers who visit certain areas of our Website. Aggregated information will not contain any information that can be linked directly back to you.\n\nWhile we take all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our Website visitors, we cannot promise that the current limitations of our online applications programming will address every browser setting or honor every personal browser preference. In particular, we have not implemented the necessary program changes to honor “Do Not Track” or “DNT” browser signals. As our online applications programming is refined, we will take all reasonable steps to honor such requests in the future. Please return to this Privacy Policy for further updates on this topic.\n\nFurther, our online service providers or business partners may implement technologies that allow for the collection of personally identifiable information over time and across Websites. We recommend that you review each privacy policy posted on the Websites that you visit to better understand privacy practices on those Websites.\n\nElectronic Communications \nWhen you open emails from us or engage in SMS or MMS communications, we may log and store such information. We may also keep records of various communications regarding the types of products and services that you indicate are of interest to you via your response to email and text messaging.

What Information Is Collected\nThe following are the types of information we may collect: \nThe Great Courses may collect personal information, which shall include but is not limited to, name, telephone number, email address, date of birth, home or business mailing address, and details regarding your mode of payment, e.g., credit/debit card or account information, when you access certain areas of the Website that require registration or payment for products and services, or if you require more information about those services.\n\nNon-Personal Information\nAt other times, The Great Courses may collect information that cannot be used to directly identify you, such as browser type, Dynamic Internet Protocol (IP) address, “click stream” data, and similar non-personally identifiable information. For example, we may aggregate non-personal information about you and other customers who visit certain areas of our Website. Aggregated information will not contain any information that can be linked directly back to you.\n\nWhile we take all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our Website visitors, we cannot promise that the current limitations of our online applications programming will address every browser setting or honor every personal browser preference. In particular, we have not implemented the necessary program changes to honor “Do Not Track” or “DNT” browser signals. As our online applications programming is refined, we will take all reasonable steps to honor such requests in the future. Please return to this Privacy Policy for further updates on this topic.\n\nFurther, our online service providers or business partners may implement technologies that allow for the collection of personally identifiable information over time and across Websites. We recommend that you review each privacy policy posted on the Websites that you visit to better understand privacy practices on those Websites.\n\nElectronic Communications \nWhen you open emails from us or engage in SMS or MMS communications, we may log and store such information. We may also keep records of various communications regarding the types of products and services that you indicate are of interest to you via your response to email and text messaging. You will always have the option to opt-out of such communications by clicking an “unsubscribe” link or replying “STOP” to our text messages. \n2.

Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes (see the rules of each contest for details about how your personal information will be used, including postings to the Website).\n\nSurveys and Games \nFrom time-to-time we may request personally identifiable information from you in conjunction with a survey or games, such as quizzes.

You can’t download just the audio, only video, which is not too convenient if you are listening while driving unless you want to get a ticket for watching video while driving, because you can’t switch the downloaded video to audio only.

Since I listen to courses primarily at work, where I have spotty cell reception, streaming isn’t an option, and since video stops playing if you exit the app or turn the screen off, I have to listen with my phone unlocked all day, which is not great for my battery life. Second, when I listen to the app it takes over the mini audio controller in the command center on my iPhone, even after I’ve started listening to music or podcasts. I have to restart the phone to get the correct audio source to display again. This also means that features like pausing without having to manually open and go into the appropriate app don’t work properly, whether I’m trying to do it from the lock screen, the command center, or headphone controls.

In addition, episodes would start in odd locations, again prompting a dangerous one handed juggling act. Good news? It’s not as bad as their one star Apple TV app. Bad news?

About six hours in to the drive, I noticed I had six text messages from Verizon notifying me that I had gone over my data for the month, repeatedly.  Despite those settings, the app continued to download content over my cellular network and cost me nearly $70 in data overage fees.
