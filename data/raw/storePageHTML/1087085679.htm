      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Well the game is relaxing sometimes but it is more fun with the updates and all of the trucks are good the two do not like are the EDGE and the BEACH ROACH that are small and not very good in my mind but all the other are pretty amazing the one truck that stands out is the TANNK but that is not what it is call but it is a beast at a lot of things demo derby&#39;s and and finding crates but you need to have a lot money to max it out. But in the beginning it really hard to get money then after you have some and your truck maxed out or something like that then it is fun but the stock trucks are pretty bad to start but get game money and your good. <br /><br />Here is a little update one what I think of the game now. The game has come so far on how good it I did say that the beginning truck are not that good. But now I think that they are way better then what they were. I have tried them all and did some testing and they are way better then before. And now I have a lot trucks and a lot of money gold and rare parts and that was a update that happened a little bit ago and I love it the game now. I did love it before but now I really really love it there no other game like this but there one thing in that I would like to put out there and that there is not really good damage in the game but only in demolition durby you can bang them up. But in multiplayer you do not see it but it would be really cool to see that happing some time in the future.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The initial grind is tough. There isn’t much in the way of online walkthrough’s, help, or guides. I don’t know if that’s because it’s a new game or not enough people have played it to warrant that level of community? <br /><br />That being said, I REALLY enjoy it. I started out with the awful starter jeep and played derbies because I didn’t stand a chance in racing and the missions just didn’t do it for me. Got to where I could beat the hard level derbies and make some decent money. Saved up, bought the APC, got the plow, sold the Jeep and rolled the money over into the APC. Now I can cash grind the hard level derby with ease.<br /><br />Most frustrating for me is trying to complete the special missions for the project car. I have no problem doing the missions to get it. I really enjoy completing them to actually earn it and not buy my way through using gold, but there is no way to locate them. If I have to drive every square inch of all the maps to find those missions I’m going to have to pay gold to unlock the project car, and I feel like it’s a cheap shot to get someone frustrated enough to spend cash on the game. <br /><br />Overall I REALLY enjoy it, I just wish there was more help in the initial grind and finding the special missions. <br /><br />Keep up the great work guys! This one is one I deeply enjoy playing!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi, thank you for the detailed review. There are currently 4 special missions for one vehicle, the first 2 are on Desert, the second 2 are on Forest. You can find them by looking for a vehicle icon on the map in single player free roam. Bear in mind they do need rare parts to unlock (except the initial one), those can be found in crates and earned in other ways (you can read more about it in the game&#39;s &#39;Game Info&#39; section, the &#39;Currencies&#39; page).</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Honestly I thought they game would be fun, I was wrong. A lot of time looks like it went into make the game look decent, but that’s where the praise ends unfortunately. The game itself is pretty buggy and the economics in the game are outrageous. I paid $12 of my own money for in game cash to try and build a fun vehicle I could play with, what did I get? A truck that cannot even climb a hill a child could have made in a sand pit. Again the game is buggy and this also make the playing experience poor, I gave this game 5 stars in hopes more people would be able to read it, but I’d like to give it 1 and caution anyone to not spend real money for this game because as it sits it’s a waste of your hard earned money.</p>

friends update too!\nBig content update with several new vehicle, new features and a big expansion to the Arena map. You can read the full version of the change log on our website, linked as the Support URL here.\n- Added 3 new vehicles: the “EDGE” side-by-side (with a working CVT), the “LABORER” SUV with a ton of customization, including complete rear end swaps and truggy builds, and the “LTV” ATV featuring floating wheels and tank steer, and it has to be obtained via a series of missions starting on Desert.\n- Added a big expansion to Arena with working drag strips (pre-stage, stage lights included). 6 strips total with different lengths and surfaces, also a bunch of ramps and half- and other pipes, and a stair climber obstacle.\n- Added night mode for all maps. For multiplayer night is assigned randomly, or can be selected manually when creating. You can complete missions and trails in night mode as well, but not races, since the bots haven’t found out how to turn on the headlights yet.\n- Added colorable working lights to all vehicles.\n- Separated suspension and wheel setup for front/rear.\n- Added 2 new currencies - Gold and Rare Parts. Gold can be used to purchase vehicles, upgrades, and consumables. Rare parts can be used to purchase specific special mission unlocks and specific high level vehicles and parts. Both can be earned normally through gameplay. \n- Added 7 consumable items you can use to temporarily boost your performance that you can buy for Gold in the Items store section.\n- Added crates with randomized rewards onto levels (excluding Arena), in which you can find Points, Gold, Rare Parts and various consumables, depending on their rarity.\n- Reworked some existing vehicle models a bit in preparation for parts overhauls \n- Worked on derby scoring and placement a bit\n- Halved over-inflated derby destruction rewards, instead adding Gold rewards for them, and Rare Parts if you destroy every opponent vehicle while not outleveling them.\n- Reworked how the game calculates displayed vehicle speed and made it consistent with MPH and KM/H, which is now displayed and can be selected in the controls settings menu. \n- Raised stock and low level vehicle maximum speed to be a bit more realistic and consistent with the reworked speed measurements. Overall vehicle speed has increased, despite the perceived numbers, especially in MPH.\n- Raised overall tire grip, especially at lower level, while keeping maxed tire grip close to what it was.\n- Added 2 new tire models \n- Tire models now affect grip per surface type, as shown in the wheel customization menu \n- Added a flex testing rig in the vehicle customization menu\n- Added the ability to upgrade and change setups while in online free roam\n- Limited account renaming to once per day to thwart some online griefing\n- Added 2 more engine upgrade levels, purchasable with Gold and Rare Parts. These are not relevant for most crawling and mission applications, but you might want the extra power if you race a lot.\n- Added 4 special missions that demonstrate the LTV’s capabilities, and provide progress to the one you get as a project vehicle.\n- Added social login with Facebook and Sign in with Apple, you can now link those to your account for account recovery, and login to them after reinstalling the game on any device. You can’t go online from 2 devices on the same game account though.\n- Refreshed daily challenge vehicle setups to be more interesting and unique, reworked the daily mission system a bit to hopefully prevent some of the issues some players experienced.\n- Readjusted most Racers dealership vehicles.\n- Added a Game Info section in the Info menu with help messages in regards to the game functionality, some of them are placed in game menus as well with a [?] button.\n","releaseDate":"2020-06-26"},{"versionDisplay":"4.11.11","releaseNotes":"4.11.11:\n- Fixed issue where AI would hang

the game is relaxing sometimes but it is more fun with the updates and all of the trucks are good the two do not like are the EDGE and the BEACH ROACH that are small and not very good in my mind but all the other are pretty amazing the one truck that stands out is the TANNK but that is not what it is call but it is a beast at a lot of things demo derby's and and finding crates but you need to have a lot money to max it out. But in the beginning it really hard to get money then after you have some and your truck maxed out or something like that then it is fun but the stock trucks are pretty bad to start but get game money and your good. \n\nHere is a little update one what I think of the game now. The game has come so far on how good it I did say that the beginning truck are not that good. But now I think that they are way better then what they were. I have tried them all and did some testing and they are way better then before. And now I have a lot trucks and a lot of money gold and rare parts and that was a update that happened a little bit ago and I love it the game now. I did love it before but now I really really love it there no other game like this but there one thing in that I would like to put out there and that there is not really good damage in the game but only in demolition durby you can bang them up. But in multiplayer you do not see it but it would be really cool to see that happing some time in the future.","title":"All of above and some lows/update on what I think","userName":"matte Black 200"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6354425959","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-08-24T04:40:36Z","developerResponse":{"id":17574432,"body":"Hi, thank you for the detailed review. There are currently 4 special missions for one vehicle, the first 2 are on Desert, the second 2 are on Forest. You can find them by looking for a vehicle icon on the map in single player free roam. Bear in mind they do need rare parts to unlock (except the initial one), those can be found in crates and earned in other ways (you can read more about it in the game's 'Game Info' section, the 'Currencies' page).","modified":"2020-08-29T15:48:01Z"},"rating":5,"review":"The initial grind is tough. There isn’t much in the way of online walkthrough’s, help, or guides. I don’t know if that’s because it’s a new game or not enough people have played it to warrant that level of community? \n\nThat being said, I REALLY enjoy it. I started out with the awful starter jeep and played derbies because I didn’t stand a chance in racing and the missions just didn’t do it for me. Got to where I could beat the hard level derbies and make some decent money. Saved up, bought the APC, got the plow, sold the Jeep and rolled the money over into the APC. Now I can cash grind the hard level derby with ease.\n\nMost frustrating for me is trying to complete the special missions for the project car. I have no problem doing the missions to get it. I really enjoy completing them to actually earn it and not buy my way through using gold, but there is no way to locate them. If I have to drive every square inch of all the maps to find those missions I’m going to have to pay gold to unlock the project car, and I feel like it’s a cheap shot to get someone frustrated enough to spend cash on the game. \n\nOverall I REALLY enjoy it, I just wish there was more help in the initial grind and finding the special missions. \n\nKeep up the great work guys! This one is one I deeply enjoy playing!","title":"Very fun, but.....","userName":"Megapeyt"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5456964771","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-01-28T03:09:06Z","rating":5,"review":"Honestly I thought they game would be fun, I was wrong. A lot of time looks like it went into make the game look decent, but that’s where the praise ends unfortunately. The game itself is pretty buggy and the economics in the game are outrageous. I paid $12 of my own money for in game cash to try and build a fun vehicle I could play with, what did I get? A truck that cannot even climb a hill a child could have made in a sand pit. Again the game is buggy and this also make the playing experience poor, I gave this game 5 stars in hopes more people would be able to read it, but I’d like to give it 1 and caution anyone to not spend real money for this game because as it sits it’s a waste of your hard earned money.","title":"Please read","userName":"Tj1342421"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5798176518","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-11T23:11:01Z","rating":4,"review":"4x4 mania is one of the best off-road car/truck games I have ever played the graphics are fantastic the sounds are clear and the customization is great that being said I would like to recommend some things you could add to the game. First if you could make it possible to have offline and online games with real players including derby’s,racing etc that would be awesome. Secondly if you could add more customization options and add more modern trucks like a Dodge Ram or a Chevy that would be great to have I like how the creators like to stick with the old square body truck models in the game but to add some new vehicles would be great too. Lastly if you could add tournaments to the game to make some big money in a big event pretty sure it would make it easier on everybody to buy new trucks/parts.

Although I would love if you could put an off road park in the game with jumps and more structured racing tracks. It would also be cool if there were also off-road drag races. I would also sud just that in the winter arena you should make it so if you stand still on the ice lake it starts to break up. Also you should add an arena with rivers or islands that have low water crossings. Also you could make missions where we pick up goods at one point and deliver them to another and different trucks would have divergent load capacity’s.

It’s super inconvenient cause even if I use the camera switch button it’ll still stay locked on to my car, I can’t even see what’s in front of me. Even if I start gassing foward the camera still faces directly at my car. I can’t even aim for other enemy cars in derby because of this. \n\nUnnecessary props: why does the derby need so many unnecessary props like the tires and telephone poles? All they do is get in the way and make me dislike the game a little. Almost all the time people will knock the wheels and telephone poles down spreading them all over the arena. All they do is make the game difficult, even if I use a low car, tires STILL somehow get stuck underneath my car and I can’t move. And the reset button is no help, lemme elaborate about the reset button down here \n\nReset button: And the reset button in here is useless, it doesn’t even show up when I need it. I was flipped over getting dragged around the arena for 2 minutes not once did the reset button pop up. \n\nI mean I like this game it’s fun and it’s an awesome feeling destroying cars. but these problems make me not play the game as much","title":"2 stars","userName":"Qqhi CcbAeso"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4330677575","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-06-17T15:27:04Z","rating":5,"review":"I’ve played almost every off-road/4x4 game on IOS and they all are basically the same you have to pay to play on this one you are able to advance just by playing the game and it doesn’t take weeks to do so like gigabit lol also the physics are spot on even tire deformation I didn’t think that was even possible on a mobile game. Best graphics and physics out there for mobile I literally deleted all other off-road games on my phone there’s no need for them with this game around.

These are trucks with both road and rail wheels that can run on roads and tracks. You could also use these to explore the railway line.

friends update too!\nBig content update with several new vehicle, new features and a big expansion to the Arena map. You can read the full version of the change log on our website, linked as the Support URL here.\n- Added 3 new vehicles: the “EDGE” side-by-side (with a working CVT), the “LABORER” SUV with a ton of customization, including complete rear end swaps and truggy builds, and the “LTV” ATV featuring floating wheels and tank steer, and it has to be obtained via a series of missions starting on Desert.\n- Added a big expansion to Arena with working drag strips (pre-stage, stage lights included). 6 strips total with different lengths and surfaces, also a bunch of ramps and half- and other pipes, and a stair climber obstacle.\n- Added night mode for all maps. For multiplayer night is assigned randomly, or can be selected manually when creating. You can complete missions and trails in night mode as well, but not races, since the bots haven’t found out how to turn on the headlights yet.\n- Added colorable working lights to all vehicles.\n- Separated suspension and wheel setup for front/rear.\n- Added 2 new currencies - Gold and Rare Parts. Gold can be used to purchase vehicles, upgrades, and consumables. Rare parts can be used to purchase specific special mission unlocks and specific high level vehicles and parts. Both can be earned normally through gameplay. \n- Added 7 consumable items you can use to temporarily boost your performance that you can buy for Gold in the Items store section.\n- Added crates with randomized rewards onto levels (excluding Arena), in which you can find Points, Gold, Rare Parts and various consumables, depending on their rarity.\n- Reworked some existing vehicle models a bit in preparation for parts overhauls \n- Worked on derby scoring and placement a bit\n- Halved over-inflated derby destruction rewards, instead adding Gold rewards for them, and Rare Parts if you destroy every opponent vehicle while not outleveling them.\n- Reworked how the game calculates displayed vehicle speed and made it consistent with MPH and KM/H, which is now displayed and can be selected in the controls settings menu. \n- Raised stock and low level vehicle maximum speed to be a bit more realistic and consistent with the reworked speed measurements. Overall vehicle speed has increased, despite the perceived numbers, especially in MPH.\n- Raised overall tire grip, especially at lower level, while keeping maxed tire grip close to what it was.\n- Added 2 new tire models \n- Tire models now affect grip per surface type, as shown in the wheel customization menu \n- Added a flex testing rig in the vehicle customization menu\n- Added the ability to upgrade and change setups while in online free roam\n- Limited account renaming to once per day to thwart some online griefing\n- Added 2 more engine upgrade levels, purchasable with Gold and Rare Parts. These are not relevant for most crawling and mission applications, but you might want the extra power if you race a lot.\n- Added 4 special missions that demonstrate the LTV’s capabilities, and provide progress to the one you get as a project vehicle.\n- Added social login with Facebook and Sign in with Apple, you can now link those to your account for account recovery, and login to them after reinstalling the game on any device. You can’t go online from 2 devices on the same game account though.\n- Refreshed daily challenge vehicle setups to be more interesting and unique, reworked the daily mission system a bit to hopefully prevent some of the issues some players experienced.\n- Readjusted most Racers dealership vehicles.\n- Added a Game Info section in the Info menu with help messages in regards to the game functionality, some of them are placed in game menus as well with a [?] button.\n","releaseDate":"2020-06-26"},{"versionDisplay":"4.11.11","releaseNotes":"4.11.11:\n- Fixed issue where AI would hang
