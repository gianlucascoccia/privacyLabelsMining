      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>To be honest, since I have Netflix, I haven’t used you in quite a while. I even went so far as to delete the app, it’s been that long. But today I recently discovered a game that I had never heard of before. It looked quite interesting but I didn’t want to buy it. I remembered you, re-downloaded the app and found the game on my route to pick up dinner. As I was getting ready to check out, I went to my email to see if there were any promotions from you guys as I really didn’t want to pay for this game I just wanted to try it out. Unfortunately, the last one you sent me was back in August. I figured you guys had forgotten about me as I had you so I wasn’t too upset about it; but as I went to check out I noticed the promo options said I had one available, when I checked it, it was a free night rental gift from Redbox for my birthday last month. It warmed my heart so much I had to write this review. When I was actively using Redbox I was never disappointed in the quality of the videos or games or the availability of them. I give Redbox 5 stars every day of the year, even if I am not using them.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Just rented my first on demand movie threw Redbox. It was a horrible experience. I would not play if I had downloaded the movie. The only way it would let me watch was threw using my data on my Phone. It was terrible quality often times being so blurry and pixilated you could not see what was on the screen as well as shuddering. I would have to stop the app and restart the movie just to get the quality bad enough to see what was on the screen it buffered ever few minutes. I made sure it was updated uninstalled and reinstalled the rare time it let me delete the download it could start watching it with my data. I tryed 3 times to download and play it. It would download fine but would not play. All it would say was keep watching even before I had started watching it. And would not actually play no mater how many times you pressed keep watching. Unless of course it wasn’t downloaded and I was using my phones data. I called customer support and they claimed they “refreshed” the movie and extended  the available days which it didn’t and did nothing. They could not offer any real help. Please save yourself the trouble, unless you have a kicking data plan and great connection dont bother using red box on demand if you can only use your phone. It just would not play if it was downloaded. Maybe it works better on another device. Stick with there disk rental if you use Redbox I know I will.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app works pretty great for when I occasionally rent a movie. My only gripe is that the Redbox locator map is terrible. You can search based on current location or even zip but you can’t pinch and zoom on the map to see the actual cross streets. Or sometimes you can pinch and zoom but not to the area you want, and adjusting the map in any other way results in it sprinting back to the zoomed out look again. <br /><br />The list with the addresses is there but not helpful if there are several machines on the same street but may not be that close to each other. Do you ever know the actual address of stores you visit?<br /><br />So my one wish is that you could navigate the map to locate the preferred machine of your choice if you could navigate the map function as it is usually easier to locate a machine based on the map, especially if the machine is located in a shopping center.</p>

This Privacy Policy only covers information collected on the Redbox Platforms and offline by Redbox.\n\nPlease review this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review the Terms of Use, which govern your use of the Redbox Platforms.\n\nCHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY\r\nTo the extent allowed by applicable law, Redbox reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. Redbox will notify you of material changes by posting the changed or modified Privacy Policy on the Redbox Platforms. We may also provide notice to you in other ways, such as through contact information you have provided. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the any of the Redbox Platforms after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy will constitute your consent to those changes to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. However, Redbox will provide notice and obtain your consent (opt-in or opt-out) if required. Note, that you may need to consent to our new policies in order to continue to use the Redbox Platforms and our services.\r\n\r\nTHE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT\r\nWe collect information from you directly, automatically when you visit the Redbox Platforms and sometimes from third parties.  Some of this information may be considered “personal information” under various applicable laws.  We consider information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal information (such as your name, phone number, e-mail address), and we treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as “personal information” where required by applicable law. And, if we combine information we consider to be non-personal with personal information, we will treat that combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. Note that we may de-identify personal information so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or converting it to a code, sometimes using function commonly known as a “hash.”  We will treat de-identified information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. \r\n\r\nInformation You Provide Us\r\nWe may ask you to provide information when you interact with us, including contact information and other personal information, payment information (for example, credit card or gift card information), demographic information (for example, your gender, age or similar information), and information about the titles you rent from our kiosks or stream online through our streaming services. Certain features may also collect information about your preferences and interests. We may also collect information from you when you interact with our customer service team over the phone or through chat or if you respond to our text messages. \r\n\r\nInformation We Collect Automatically\r\nWe and third-party advertising companies and business partners may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect certain information whenever you visit any Redbox Platform or otherwise interact with us or our content (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include the hardware model, browser, and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Redbox Platform you are visiting, all of the areas within the Redbox Platforms that you visit, the content you watch and how you interact with it, your time zone, location information, and mobile network (if applicable), among other information. In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access our Redbox Platforms. In some cases, we may directly collect location information through your device. You may be able to turn off the collection of location information through the settings on your device. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Redbox associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Redbox treats it as personal information.\r\n\r\nThe methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include the following:\r\n\r\nCookies and Local Storage\r\nCookies and local storage are data files placed within a browser on a device when it is used to visit a Redbox Platform. Certain web browsers and browser add-ons, such as Adobe Flash, may provide additional local data storage mechanisms. For example, a Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plugin. Cookies and local storage can be used for a variety of purposes, including to store a unique identifier for your device that recognizes your device as you visit the Redbox Platforms or other web sites or online services and to remember your preferences. Most browsers provide you with the ability to disable or decline cookies and local storage. You will need to check your browser’s settings for further information. For more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html. If you choose to disable cookies or to adjust your Flash privacy settings on your device, some features of a Redbox Platform may not function properly.\r\n\r\nWeb Tags\r\nSmall graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”), may be included in our web pages and e-mail messages. Web tags or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to a Redbox Platform, to monitor how users navigate a Redbox Platform, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular videos or links were actually viewed.\r\n\r\nBeacons.  Beacons are small, wireless transmitters that use low energy Bluetooth technology to send signals to other smart devices in their proximity and can be used by mobile applications to help locate a device’s physical location.  We may use beacons when your device interacts with the Redbox Platforms, typically through a mobile application, to help you locate a Redbox kiosk, to serve you relevant advertisements, and may in some instances, share beacon data with third parties, including to serve you advertisements based on your location. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we may use these and a variety of other technologies that collect Usage Information and similar information for security and fraud detection purposes and to enforce our intellectual property rights. This includes the use of digital rights management technology that is embedded in DVDs, streamed content or other content provided by Redbox in order to prevent theft and unauthorized access to content, and to protect the intellectual property rights of Redbox and content owners.\r\n\r\nInformation Third Parties Provide About You \r\nRedbox may receive information about you from third parties, including business partners and data providers. For example, if you are on another website and you agree to receive information from Redbox, that site will forward your information to us so that we may contact you.  And, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties, such as public databases, publicly available Social Media pages, and third parties who enhance the information we have about you. We use this information to better provide you with information and products, to tailor our content and the offers we show you, and for other business purposes.  The information collected and stored by the third party is subject solely to the third party’s privacy practices.\r\n\r\nSocial Media Interactions \r\nThe Redbox Platforms may host or facilitate interactions with an interactive third-party website or service (“Social Media”), which may include the ability for you to “like” or “share” content.

If you’re logged out or don’t have a Facebook account and visit a website with the Like button or another social plugin, your browser sends us a more limited set of info. For example, because you’re not logged into Facebook, you’ll have fewer cookies than someone who's logged in. Like other sites on the Internet, we receive info about the web page you're visiting, the date and time and other browser‐related info. We record this info to help us improve our products.

Providing such self-identifying information is voluntary, but if you do provide such information, we and/or our service provider may submit that information to the appropriate government or regulatory agencies to fulfill reporting requirements and use that information to defend against employment-related complaints.\r\nPlease note that we may utilize a careers portal that is operated by a third party, in which case your use of the careers portal will be subject to the third party’s privacy practices as disclosed on the portal, and not to this policy.\r\nAdministrative and Legal Reasons\r\nWe may transfer and disclose user information to third parties: (i) in the event we are required to comply with a legal obligation, such as respond to subpoenas or other legal process or if we believe in good faith that the law requires it; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; or (iii) to protect and/or defend the Terms of Use, the Redbox Transaction Terms or other policies applicable to a Redbox Platform or our services; (iv) to respond to an emergency; or (v) otherwise to protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of Redbox, our customers, or a third party.

collect, use, disclose, and sell, including the right to request that we provide to you the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you in the prior 12 months (“Right to Know”); (2) that we delete the Personal Information we have collected from you (“Right to Delete”); and to opt-out from the sale of their Personal Information as well as to re-opt in, all subject to exceptions set forth in the CCPA. More information on each of these rights is below. \r\nIf you are an agent submitting a request on a consumer’s behalf, you may do so by following this link and submitting a signed Declaration of Designated Agent at: https://redbox.com/access-delete and https://redbox.com/donotsell. The written permission must state your full legal name, the full legal name of the individual who is the subject of the request, and needs to be clear about the permission granted. Alternatively, you may submit a copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465. The consumer’s identity, in addition to your own, will need to be independently verified in order for us to be able to fulfill your request. We may also ask the consumer to directly confirm with us that they provided you permission to submit a request. Please keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer’s behalf, we may deny the request. \r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A REQUEST TO KNOW OR REQUEST TO DELETE\r\n\r\nIf you are a California consumer and would like to request information about the Personal Information we have collected about you in the prior 12 months or request that we delete information we have collected from you, please complete this form https://redbox.com/access-delete or call us toll-free at 1-866-733-2693. \r\n\r\nVerifying Requests\r\n\r\nPlease note that we will take steps to verify your identity in order to fulfill your request. We will first verify your email address is active and we will take steps to verify the information you provide to us. \r\nIn order to verify your identity, we will request that you provide: your name, email address/phone number (depending on what you have used to interact with Redbox Platforms), the title of your last rental transaction, and the last 4 digits of the credit card used. \r\nIf we are unable to verify that the individual submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected information (or someone authorized by that individual to act on their behalf), we will not be able to process the request.\r\n\r\nOther Important Information\r\nREQUEST TO KNOW\r\nIn order to have us provide specific pieces of information, we will require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the request.\r\n  \r\nREQUEST TO DELETE\r\nTo ensure that we do not delete your Personal Information in response to a fraudulent request, we will follow up after you submit your request in order to confirm that you want your information to be deleted.\r\n\r\nRIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THE SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\r\nThe CCPA also provides California consumers the right to request to opt-out of the sale of Personal Information as well as the ability to re-opt in. \r\nIf you are a California resident and would like to opt-out of the sale of Personal Information or re-opt in, please submit your request by completing the following form: https://redbox.com/donotsell or call us toll-free at 1-866-733-2693.  \r\nAs discussed above, certain third-party online analytics and advertising companies may collect data from visitors to the Redbox Platforms through the use of cookies, including to better serve you more relevant advertisements, which may potentially be considered “sales” under the CCPA. \r\nTo opt-out of cookies and other tracking technologies set by Redbox and its third party business partners that are potentially “sales” under the CCPA, launch the Privacy Preference Center on our website. \r\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) also offers tools for California consumers to send requests under the CCPA to opt out of the sale of personal information by some or all of the participating companies https://www.privacyrights.info/. \r\n\r\nIn addition, as we state in our privacy policy, some of the companies we work with for analytics and advertising purposes are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and you may want to visit the following webpages, which provide “opt-out” mechanisms for participating companies: https://optout.networkadvertising.org  and http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ You may opt-out from interest based advertising on your mobile device through your mobile device settings. \r\n\r\nNote that these are cookie-based opt-outs. If you disable your cookies or upgrade your browser after opting out, or if you use different computers or browsers, you will need to indicate your opt-out choices across those other computers and browsers.\r\n\r\nYou may also be able to limit the access these third parties have to information about you when you use the Redbox Platforms by installing a browser or browser extension that can enable you to block the functionality of some tracking technologies.\r\n\r\nUsers younger than 16\r\nRedbox does not target users younger than age 18 and, therefore, does not knowingly collect or sell Personal Information of minors younger than 16 years of age. \r\nRight to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights\r\nCalifornia consumers have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising CCPA rights.  We will not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA rights. \r\nContact for More Information \r\nYou can contact us for more information by writing us at Legal, Redbox Automated Retail, LLC, 1 Tower Lane, Suite 800, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois 60181 or emailing privacy@redbox.com.\r\n\r\nOther California Rights/Your California Privacy Rights\r\n\r\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits residents of California to request certain details about how their personal information has been shared during the calendar year with third parties for those third parties’ own direct marketing purposes, unless the business permits California residents to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing. Redbox qualifies for this alternative option. As noted above, we will not share personal information about you with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes if you do not opt-in, or if you choose to opt-out, at the time Redbox offers you that choice.\r\n\r\nIf you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please write us at Attention Legal, Redbox Automated Retail, LLC, 1 Tower Lane, Suite 800, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois 60181. You must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your email or in the address line of your envelope. You must include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO NEVADA RESIDENTS\r\nRedbox does not currently sell your covered information as those terms are defined under applicable Nevada law. You may still submit an opt-out request and we will honor that request as required by Nevada law if Redbox were to engage in such a sale in the future. If you are a Nevada resident and would like to opt-out of the sale of your covered information, please submit your request to https://redbox.com/donotsell.  Your request must include your full name, street address, city, state, zip code, and an email address so that we can contact if needed regarding this request.

This Privacy Policy only covers information collected on the Redbox Platforms and offline by Redbox.\n\nPlease review this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review the Terms of Use, which govern your use of the Redbox Platforms.\n\nCHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY\r\nTo the extent allowed by applicable law, Redbox reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. Redbox will notify you of material changes by posting the changed or modified Privacy Policy on the Redbox Platforms. We may also provide notice to you in other ways, such as through contact information you have provided. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the any of the Redbox Platforms after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy will constitute your consent to those changes to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. However, Redbox will provide notice and obtain your consent (opt-in or opt-out) if required. Note, that you may need to consent to our new policies in order to continue to use the Redbox Platforms and our services.\r\n\r\nTHE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT\r\nWe collect information from you directly, automatically when you visit the Redbox Platforms and sometimes from third parties.  Some of this information may be considered “personal information” under various applicable laws.  We consider information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal information (such as your name, phone number, e-mail address), and we treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as “personal information” where required by applicable law. And, if we combine information we consider to be non-personal with personal information, we will treat that combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. Note that we may de-identify personal information so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or converting it to a code, sometimes using function commonly known as a “hash.”  We will treat de-identified information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. \r\n\r\nInformation You Provide Us\r\nWe may ask you to provide information when you interact with us, including contact information and other personal information, payment information (for example, credit card or gift card information), demographic information (for example, your gender, age or similar information), and information about the titles you rent from our kiosks or stream online through our streaming services. Certain features may also collect information about your preferences and interests. We may also collect information from you when you interact with our customer service team over the phone or through chat or if you respond to our text messages. \r\n\r\nInformation We Collect Automatically\r\nWe and third-party advertising companies and business partners may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect certain information whenever you visit any Redbox Platform or otherwise interact with us or our content (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include the hardware model, browser, and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Redbox Platform you are visiting, all of the areas within the Redbox Platforms that you visit, the content you watch and how you interact with it, your time zone, location information, and mobile network (if applicable), among other information. In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access our Redbox Platforms. In some cases, we may directly collect location information through your device. You may be able to turn off the collection of location information through the settings on your device. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Redbox associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Redbox treats it as personal information.\r\n\r\nThe methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include the following:\r\n\r\nCookies and Local Storage\r\nCookies and local storage are data files placed within a browser on a device when it is used to visit a Redbox Platform. Certain web browsers and browser add-ons, such as Adobe Flash, may provide additional local data storage mechanisms. For example, a Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plugin. Cookies and local storage can be used for a variety of purposes, including to store a unique identifier for your device that recognizes your device as you visit the Redbox Platforms or other web sites or online services and to remember your preferences. Most browsers provide you with the ability to disable or decline cookies and local storage. You will need to check your browser’s settings for further information. For more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html. If you choose to disable cookies or to adjust your Flash privacy settings on your device, some features of a Redbox Platform may not function properly.\r\n\r\nWeb Tags\r\nSmall graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”), may be included in our web pages and e-mail messages. Web tags or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to a Redbox Platform, to monitor how users navigate a Redbox Platform, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular videos or links were actually viewed.\r\n\r\nBeacons.  Beacons are small, wireless transmitters that use low energy Bluetooth technology to send signals to other smart devices in their proximity and can be used by mobile applications to help locate a device’s physical location.  We may use beacons when your device interacts with the Redbox Platforms, typically through a mobile application, to help you locate a Redbox kiosk, to serve you relevant advertisements, and may in some instances, share beacon data with third parties, including to serve you advertisements based on your location. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we may use these and a variety of other technologies that collect Usage Information and similar information for security and fraud detection purposes and to enforce our intellectual property rights. This includes the use of digital rights management technology that is embedded in DVDs, streamed content or other content provided by Redbox in order to prevent theft and unauthorized access to content, and to protect the intellectual property rights of Redbox and content owners.\r\n\r\nInformation Third Parties Provide About You \r\nRedbox may receive information about you from third parties, including business partners and data providers. For example, if you are on another website and you agree to receive information from Redbox, that site will forward your information to us so that we may contact you.  And, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties, such as public databases, publicly available Social Media pages, and third parties who enhance the information we have about you. We use this information to better provide you with information and products, to tailor our content and the offers we show you, and for other business purposes.  The information collected and stored by the third party is subject solely to the third party’s privacy practices.\r\n\r\nSocial Media Interactions \r\nThe Redbox Platforms may host or facilitate interactions with an interactive third-party website or service (“Social Media”), which may include the ability for you to “like” or “share” content.  You may also have the opportunity to log in through or otherwise connect your account on a Social Media service (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). When you interact with Social Media through the Redbox Platforms, we will receive information about you from that third-party service and they may set their own cookies and collect information about your use of the Redbox Platforms, including your IP address or other Device Identifier and which page you are visiting on a Redbox Platform. These Social Media platforms may be able to collect certain information about your visits to the Sites regardless of whether or not you affirmatively interact with the feature and whether or not you are logged into (or have) an account with the third party platform. If you’re logged out or don’t have a Facebook account and visit a website with the Like button or another social plugin, your browser sends us a more limited set of info.

collect, use, disclose, and sell, including the right to request that we provide to you the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you in the prior 12 months (“Right to Know”); (2) that we delete the Personal Information we have collected from you (“Right to Delete”); and to opt-out from the sale of their Personal Information as well as to re-opt in, all subject to exceptions set forth in the CCPA. More information on each of these rights is below. \r\nIf you are an agent submitting a request on a consumer’s behalf, you may do so by following this link and submitting a signed Declaration of Designated Agent at: https://redbox.com/access-delete and https://redbox.com/donotsell. The written permission must state your full legal name, the full legal name of the individual who is the subject of the request, and needs to be clear about the permission granted. Alternatively, you may submit a copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465. The consumer’s identity, in addition to your own, will need to be independently verified in order for us to be able to fulfill your request. We may also ask the consumer to directly confirm with us that they provided you permission to submit a request. Please keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer’s behalf, we may deny the request. \r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A REQUEST TO KNOW OR REQUEST TO DELETE\r\n\r\nIf you are a California consumer and would like to request information about the Personal Information we have collected about you in the prior 12 months or request that we delete information we have collected from you, please complete this form https://redbox.com/access-delete or call us toll-free at 1-866-733-2693. \r\n\r\nVerifying Requests\r\n\r\nPlease note that we will take steps to verify your identity in order to fulfill your request. We will first verify your email address is active and we will take steps to verify the information you provide to us. \r\nIn order to verify your identity, we will request that you provide: your name, email address/phone number (depending on what you have used to interact with Redbox Platforms), the title of your last rental transaction, and the last 4 digits of the credit card used. \r\nIf we are unable to verify that the individual submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected information (or someone authorized by that individual to act on their behalf), we will not be able to process the request.\r\n\r\nOther Important Information\r\nREQUEST TO KNOW\r\nIn order to have us provide specific pieces of information, we will require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the request.\r\n  \r\nREQUEST TO DELETE\r\nTo ensure that we do not delete your Personal Information in response to a fraudulent request, we will follow up after you submit your request in order to confirm that you want your information to be deleted.\r\n\r\nRIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THE SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\r\nThe CCPA also provides California consumers the right to request to opt-out of the sale of Personal Information as well as the ability to re-opt in. \r\nIf you are a California resident and would like to opt-out of the sale of Personal Information or re-opt in, please submit your request by completing the following form: https://redbox.com/donotsell or call us toll-free at 1-866-733-2693.  \r\nAs discussed above, certain third-party online analytics and advertising companies may collect data from visitors to the Redbox Platforms through the use of cookies, including to better serve you more relevant advertisements, which may potentially be considered “sales” under the CCPA. \r\nTo opt-out of cookies and other tracking technologies set by Redbox and its third party business partners that are potentially “sales” under the CCPA, launch the Privacy Preference Center on our website. \r\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) also offers tools for California consumers to send requests under the CCPA to opt out of the sale of personal information by some or all of the participating companies https://www.privacyrights.info/. \r\n\r\nIn addition, as we state in our privacy policy, some of the companies we work with for analytics and advertising purposes are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and you may want to visit the following webpages, which provide “opt-out” mechanisms for participating companies: https://optout.networkadvertising.org  and http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ You may opt-out from interest based advertising on your mobile device through your mobile device settings. \r\n\r\nNote that these are cookie-based opt-outs. If you disable your cookies or upgrade your browser after opting out, or if you use different computers or browsers, you will need to indicate your opt-out choices across those other computers and browsers.\r\n\r\nYou may also be able to limit the access these third parties have to information about you when you use the Redbox Platforms by installing a browser or browser extension that can enable you to block the functionality of some tracking technologies.\r\n\r\nUsers younger than 16\r\nRedbox does not target users younger than age 18 and, therefore, does not knowingly collect or sell Personal Information of minors younger than 16 years of age. \r\nRight to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights\r\nCalifornia consumers have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising CCPA rights.  We will not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA rights. \r\nContact for More Information \r\nYou can contact us for more information by writing us at Legal, Redbox Automated Retail, LLC, 1 Tower Lane, Suite 800, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois 60181 or emailing privacy@redbox.com.\r\n\r\nOther California Rights/Your California Privacy Rights\r\n\r\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits residents of California to request certain details about how their personal information has been shared during the calendar year with third parties for those third parties’ own direct marketing purposes, unless the business permits California residents to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing. Redbox qualifies for this alternative option. As noted above, we will not share personal information about you with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes if you do not opt-in, or if you choose to opt-out, at the time Redbox offers you that choice.\r\n\r\nIf you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please write us at Attention Legal, Redbox Automated Retail, LLC, 1 Tower Lane, Suite 800, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois 60181.

We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO NEVADA RESIDENTS\r\nRedbox does not currently sell your covered information as those terms are defined under applicable Nevada law. You may still submit an opt-out request and we will honor that request as required by Nevada law if Redbox were to engage in such a sale in the future. If you are a Nevada resident and would like to opt-out of the sale of your covered information, please submit your request to https://redbox.com/donotsell.

I even went so far as to delete the app, it’s been that long. But today I recently discovered a game that I had never heard of before. It looked quite interesting but I didn’t want to buy it. I remembered you, re-downloaded the app and found the game on my route to pick up dinner. As I was getting ready to check out, I went to my email to see if there were any promotions from you guys as I really didn’t want to pay for this game I just wanted to try it out. Unfortunately, the last one you sent me was back in August. I figured you guys had forgotten about me as I had you so I wasn’t too upset about it; but as I went to check out I noticed the promo options said I had one available, when I checked it, it was a free night rental gift from Redbox for my birthday last month. It warmed my heart so much I had to write this review. When I was actively using Redbox I was never disappointed in the quality of the videos or games or the availability of them. I give Redbox 5 stars every day of the year, even if I am not using them.","title":"Dearest Redbox","userName":"SohoNative"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6824965654","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-01-03T07:07:39Z","developerResponse":{"id":20175409,"body":"Hey there!

It was a horrible experience. I would not play if I had downloaded the movie. The only way it would let me watch was threw using my data on my Phone. It was terrible quality often times being so blurry and pixilated you could not see what was on the screen as well as shuddering. I would have to stop the app and restart the movie just to get the quality bad enough to see what was on the screen it buffered ever few minutes. I made sure it was updated uninstalled and reinstalled the rare time it let me delete the download it could start watching it with my data. I tryed 3 times to download and play it. It would download fine but would not play. All it would say was keep watching even before I had started watching it. And would not actually play no mater how many times you pressed keep watching. Unless of course it wasn’t downloaded and I was using my phones data. I called customer support and they claimed they “refreshed” the movie and extended  the available days which it didn’t and did nothing. They could not offer any real help. Please save yourself the trouble, unless you have a kicking data plan and great connection dont bother using red box on demand if you can only use your phone. It just would not play if it was downloaded. Maybe it works better on another device.
