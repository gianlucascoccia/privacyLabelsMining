      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Sorry HBO I really love your shows, but here are the things I have issues with your App and your Xbox One version of the app (it seems like others are having a problem with this too, like Ps4)<br /><br />My List- this is always a great function in a streaming service. When it’s accessible... My List does not always appear in HBO Max. Additionally doesn’t not list all the things you’ve added to it when it does. This is frustrating for people who are trying to watch something they have added, only to have to search for it again. Big no no.<br /><br />Episode Selection- watching a show sometimes you miss something, wether you got busy around the house or fell asleep, I know I can find the episodes.. if I search for it again. But unlike other apps I can’t select another episode from the episode I’m in. For example. Netflix on the Xbox, or PlayStation. While watching an episode you can hit (X on Xbox) (square on PS) to view the episode list. Why do I need to search it again. <br /><br />All in all I respect the Swift Roll-Out for HBO Max, and switching the subscriptions from HBO to HBO Max. But the Max App for Console and Phone is MISSING vital features to a streaming service. I highly suggest fixing these issues because I don’t want to see your app use slow down or disappear all together. Even after a boost in advertisements, not having these functions could end the popularity of your service. Please consider these thoughts and I hope to look forward to these changes.</p>

However, I was very disappointed to discover that while you can download videos, if you try to watch them in airplane mode (say when, I don’t know, flying on an airplane), the app will let you watch for a while then suddenly freak out and become trapped in an endless loop of error messages as it repeatedly tries and fails to contact the server. This problem has been present for months and it appears no effort has been made to fix it.<br /><br />Additionally, the app does not keep accurate track of how many videos you currently have downloaded. There is a global limit for the account of 30 downloaded videos, and if you want to download beyond that you are prompted to delete unwanted videos to stay below the limit. However, when you delete a few videos, the app continues to give you the same error message saying you can’t download more than 30 videos, and does not permit you to download.<br /><br />The content on HBO is really great, but I primarily only have time to consume it on flights. It is frustrating beyond belief that this app gets so close to the desired feature a d then totally falls flat on its face in the execution.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>When I checked under “App Privacy” in this app, it was immediately concerning to me to see that HBO is tracking me extensively on my iPhone across apps and websites and in a variety of ways: my location, my search history, my usage data, my contact information, my identifiers, and my “other data.“ (Sounds ominous, doesn’t it?) Why is this necessary, HBO? I am paying you each month, so it doesn’t seem as though you need to monetize me like this. Is that what you are doing? It says, “Data Used to Track You: The following data may be used to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.“ If HBO Max were a freebie, I guess I could understand this *to a degree* – but HBO Max bills self as a premium channel, and it is by no means free! It sounds to me like HBO Max needs to do better by its customers’ privacy rights. While I normally would’ve given HBO Max five stars— it truly is a wonderful premium service that I enjoy very much! — I’m giving it one star until this is convincingly explained to me. Oh, and I’m also deleting HBO Max from my iPhone; since I feel it necessary to do that, HBO Max just became a whole lot less valuable to me, and I may also have to reconsider my entire relationship with the company moving forward.</p>

We share Information that may identify you personally internally among affiliates publicly recognized as a WarnerMedia affiliate, such as Xandr and the AT\u0026T family of companies. A list of our publicly recognized WarnerMedia affiliates is found here. Public recognition may derive from, for example, use of common branding elements, advertising, press, social media reports or other public form of notice. We require the affiliate to protect the Information consistent with this Policy. For affiliates not publicly recognized as WarnerMedia affiliates, we share Information under the same circumstances and limitations that we impose when we share with non-WarnerMedia companies, like vendors performing services on our behalf. We may also combine Information that identifies you personally with data that comes from an app or affiliate that has a different privacy policy. When we do that, our Policy applies to the combined data set.\n\nBusiness partners and third parties. We may also share Information with business partners and third parties (e.g., other companies, retailers, research organizations, advertisers, ad agencies, advertising networks and platforms, participatory databases, publishers, and non-profit organizations) that may want to market products or services to you. If we share personal information with such unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes, we provide you with an opportunity to opt out of such uses either at the point of collection or through the choice mechanisms set forth in this Privacy Policy. To learn more about your choices, please see Your Choices and Your Controls below.\n\nLinked sites. Some of our Sites contain links to other sites, including Social Media Sites, whose information practices may be different from ours.

By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may collect or obtain Information from visitors that participate in the activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this Information. We encourage you to visit the privacy policy of any such third party to learn about their data practices.\n\nAdvertising networks. We may share certain information with third parties to provide advertising to you based on your interests. For more information, please see Ad Choices below.\n\nYour Choices\n\nMarketing communications and sharing with third parties.

If you ever decide in the future that you would like to update these preferences, you may (i) log in to an account you have created with us at one of our Sites to adjust your settings, or (ii) send us an email at privacy@hbomax.com. To opt out of receiving our email marketing communications, you can also follow the \"unsubscribe\" instructions provided in any marketing email you receive from us. If you previously chose to receive push notifications on your mobile device from us, but no longer wish to receive them, you can manage your preferences through your device or app settings, depending on the type of device. If you have signed up to receive text messages from us and no longer wish to receive such messages, you may follow the instructions to stop the delivery of such messages, which may include by replying \"STOP\" to the received text message. For California residents, please see below for additional information on the choices we provide to you.\n\nAd Choices. We may work with reputable third parties to present advertisements, and engage in data collection, reporting, ad delivery and response measurement, and site analytics on our Sites and on third party websites across the Internet and applications over time. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, or similar technologies to perform this activity. They may also obtain information about applications you use, websites you visit, and other information from across your devices and browsers in order to help serve advertising that may be more relevant to your interests on and off our Sites and across your devices and browsers. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising. They may also use this information to associate various browsers and devices together for the purpose of interest-based advertising and other purposes like analytics.\n\nFor more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser, and your ability to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in self-regulatory programs, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative and/or the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about interest-based advertising in mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA's AppChoices tool, please download the version of AppChoices for your device here. Please note that any opt-out choice you exercise through these programs will apply to interest-based advertising by the third parties you select, but will still allow the collection of data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations. You may continue to receive advertising, but that advertising may be less relevant to your interests.\n\nYou may have more options depending on your mobile device and operating system. For example, most device operating systems (e.g., iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to learn more about these features and how they apply to tailored in-app advertisements.\n\nPrecise location information. To disable the collection of precise location information from your mobile device through our mobile apps, you can access your mobile device settings and choose to limit that collection.\n\nSee also Cookies and Other Technical Information for more choices about managing other technical and usage information.\n\nCookies and Other Technical Information\n\nCookies and other technologies.

Check your browser settings to learn how to delete cookies.\n\nYou may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Controlling cookies via browser controls may not limit our use of other technologies. Please consult your browser's settings for more information. However, blocking cookies or similar technology might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Site features.\n\nSome of our Sites may use locally stored objects (\"LSOs\") to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation, and a better user experience. Adobe's Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your web browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe's web site. Your browser may also offer other tools to delete or reject other LSOs; please check your browser's settings or help menu for more information.\n\nSome of our sites may use Google Analytics to analyze traffic.

If the person who registers indicates that he or she is under 13 years old, as permitted by law we will (i) collect no or limited personal information (e.g. email address only) from that individual, (ii) inform the child that a parent's verifiable consent is required, and/or (iii) collect the email address of the user's parent in addition to the user's email address. We use the parent's email address to seek the parent's verifiable consent or notify the parent of his/her child's online activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe his/her child from a newsletter or other similar activity. Once a parent provides consent, we may use any information from the child consistent with the rest of this Privacy Policy and/or the terms of the consent provided by the parent. If a user is under 13, we will not condition his/her participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.

We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.\n\nInternational Transfer\n\nWe operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States. This means the information we collect will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union.

For instance, you may access this information, request that we delete it, and/or prohibit us from further collecting or using any information from your child. You or your adult can make these requests through our online portal here.\n\nYour California Rights\n\nCalifornia has passed a law named the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which grants California residents certain rights with respect to their personal information. The CCPA has specific rules regarding the use of children's information. In particular, the CCPA says that a parent or guardian must provide permission to sell personal information of users under the age of 13. It also allows you to ask for access to the information collected from a Kid's Profile or to ask us to delete it. Users aged 13-15 can provide permission or exercise these access and deletion rights directly.

Sometimes you may also choose to provide more sensitive forms of personal information to us, such as information regarding your physical or mental health, biometric data, race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, or trade union membership.

On some of our Sites, we may collect Information you submit about other people.

We share Information that may identify you personally internally among affiliates publicly recognized as a WarnerMedia affiliate, such as Xandr and the AT\u0026T family of companies. A list of our publicly recognized WarnerMedia affiliates is found here. Public recognition may derive from, for example, use of common branding elements, advertising, press, social media reports or other public form of notice. We require the affiliate to protect the Information consistent with this Policy. For affiliates not publicly recognized as WarnerMedia affiliates, we share Information under the same circumstances and limitations that we impose when we share with non-WarnerMedia companies, like vendors performing services on our behalf. We may also combine Information that identifies you personally with data that comes from an app or affiliate that has a different privacy policy. When we do that, our Policy applies to the combined data set.\n\nBusiness partners and third parties. We may also share Information with business partners and third parties (e.g., other companies, retailers, research organizations, advertisers, ad agencies, advertising networks and platforms, participatory databases, publishers, and non-profit organizations) that may want to market products or services to you. If we share personal information with such unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes, we provide you with an opportunity to opt out of such uses either at the point of collection or through the choice mechanisms set forth in this Privacy Policy. To learn more about your choices, please see Your Choices and Your Controls below.\n\nLinked sites. Some of our Sites contain links to other sites, including Social Media Sites, whose information practices may be different from ours.

We have no control over these third parties' use of this Information. We encourage you to visit the privacy policy of any such third party to learn about their data practices.\n\nAdvertising networks.

If you ever decide in the future that you would like to update these preferences, you may (i) log in to an account you have created with us at one of our Sites to adjust your settings, or (ii) send us an email at privacy@hbomax.com. To opt out of receiving our email marketing communications, you can also follow the \"unsubscribe\" instructions provided in any marketing email you receive from us. If you previously chose to receive push notifications on your mobile device from us, but no longer wish to receive them, you can manage your preferences through your device or app settings, depending on the type of device. If you have signed up to receive text messages from us and no longer wish to receive such messages, you may follow the instructions to stop the delivery of such messages, which may include by replying \"STOP\" to the received text message. For California residents, please see below for additional information on the choices we provide to you.\n\nAd Choices. We may work with reputable third parties to present advertisements, and engage in data collection, reporting, ad delivery and response measurement, and site analytics on our Sites and on third party websites across the Internet and applications over time. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, or similar technologies to perform this activity. They may also obtain information about applications you use, websites you visit, and other information from across your devices and browsers in order to help serve advertising that may be more relevant to your interests on and off our Sites and across your devices and browsers. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising. They may also use this information to associate various browsers and devices together for the purpose of interest-based advertising and other purposes like analytics.\n\nFor more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser, and your ability to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in self-regulatory programs, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative and/or the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about interest-based advertising in mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA's AppChoices tool, please download the version of AppChoices for your device here. Please note that any opt-out choice you exercise through these programs will apply to interest-based advertising by the third parties you select, but will still allow the collection of data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations. You may continue to receive advertising, but that advertising may be less relevant to your interests.\n\nYou may have more options depending on your mobile device and operating system. For example, most device operating systems (e.g., iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to learn more about these features and how they apply to tailored in-app advertisements.\n\nPrecise location information.

Controlling cookies via browser controls may not limit our use of other technologies. Please consult your browser's settings for more information. However, blocking cookies or similar technology might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Site features.\n\nSome of our Sites may use locally stored objects (\"LSOs\") to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation, and a better user experience. Adobe's Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your web browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe's web site. Your browser may also offer other tools to delete or reject other LSOs; please check your browser's settings or help menu for more information.\n\nSome of our sites may use Google Analytics to analyze traffic.

If the person who registers indicates that he or she is under 13 years old, as permitted by law we will (i) collect no or limited personal information (e.g. email address only) from that individual, (ii) inform the child that a parent's verifiable consent is required, and/or (iii) collect the email address of the user's parent in addition to the user's email address. We use the parent's email address to seek the parent's verifiable consent or notify the parent of his/her child's online activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe his/her child from a newsletter or other similar activity. Once a parent provides consent, we may use any information from the child consistent with the rest of this Privacy Policy and/or the terms of the consent provided by the parent.

You should take a look at our General Audience Privacy Policy for more information about how we will collect and use data outside Kid's Profiles on the Platform. It is important to set up a Kid's Profile for your child under 18 because the information practices for these Kid's Profiles, which are described in this Children's Privacy Policy, are different than for adult profiles.\n\nWhat Information Do We Collect From Kid Profiles?\n\n\nInformation about child users:\nWhen you make a Kid's Profile, we will ask for some information about your child, like their first name and a profile photo (where available).  You can also exercise parental controls over your child's use of the profile, like the kinds of shows and movies they can watch and how to switch between the profiles on your HBO Max account.\n\nTechnical and usage information:\nWhen any user visits or uses our Platform, we will get some information about their device and their internet browser (for example, Safari, Chrome or Firefox). We will also get some information about their IP Address, device identifiers, and how they use our Platform. To learn more, see our section about Cookies.\n\nWhen users contact us:\nIf your child contacts us by email or using an online form, we will ask them for some information. For example, this may include their first name and email address and the reason they are contacting us. Once we have completed their request, we will delete their information.\n\nHow Do We Use Information?\n\nWe use the information we collect through a Kid's Profile for the purposes described in this Children's Privacy Policy or disclosed at the time of collection or with your consent, to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\nProviding and marketing products and services. We use the information we collect through a Kid's Profile within our Platform to provide the Platform; to analyze use of our Platform; and to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve the user experience and our offerings. For example, we use information collected from a Kid's Profile within our Platform to enable your child to watch trailers, movies, programs, and video clips and find others that may interest them within the Kid's Profile. We may also use the information we collect to show offers and advertisements based on what your child is watching.\n\nCommunicating with you and others. We use the information we collect to communicate with you or respond to your child's requests, such as (i) to notify you when you win one of our contests or sweepstakes or when we make changes to our policies or user agreements, (ii) to respond to your (and your child's) inquiries and customer support requests, (iii) to communicate with you about your purchases or transactions, or (iv) to contact you about your account (including your child's activity on the account), or (v) to send you information about promotions, offerings, and Platform features.\n\nUse of technical and usage information. We use technical and usage information to improve the design, functionality and content of our Platform and to enable us to personalize your child's experience with our Platform. We use this information (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our content and our Platform, products, and programs and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our Platform and content, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, and (iv) for us to show offers and advertisements based on what your child is watching.\n\nCompliance. We may use the information we collect to detect, investigate, and prevent activities on our Platform that may violate our terms of use, could be fraudulent, violate copyright, or other rules or that may be otherwise illegal, to comply with legal requirements, and to protect our rights and the rights and safety of our users and others.\n\nHow Do We Share Information?\n\nWhen permitted by law, we may share and disclose the information we collect from a Kid's Profile in the following ways or for any other purpose disclosed at the time of collection:\n\nWith your consent. We may disclose this information when you provide us with your consent to do so or, if permitted by law, when the child provides consent.\n\nLegal and law enforcement purposes. We may disclose information in response to legal process, for example in response to a court order or a subpoena, or in response to a law enforcement agency's request. We also may disclose such information to third parties: (i) in connection with fraud prevention activities, (ii) where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, (iii) in situations that may involve violations of our terms of use or other rules, (iv) to protect our rights and the rights and safety of others, and (v) as otherwise required by law.\n\nChange of control. We may transfer the information we collect in the event of a business transaction, such as if we or one of our business units or our relevant assets are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding or a business reorganization.\n\nService providers. Our agents and contractors may have access to information to help carry out the services they are performing for us, such as, but not limited to, creating, maintaining, hosting, and delivering the Platform and our products, and services; conducting marketing, handling payments, email and order fulfillment; administering contests; conducting research and analytics; or customer service.\n\nAffiliates. We may disclose information collected through a Kid's  Profile to affiliates in some cases, such as when the affiliates act like service providers performing services on our behalf. You can find a list of some of the affiliated WarnerMedia companies here. We may update this list from time-to-time, so please check back periodically to keep up-to-date.\n\nLinked sites. Some parts of our Platform contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different from ours. Information your child submits to other sites will be governed by the other sites' privacy policies and terms.\n\nCookies And Other Technologies\n\nCookies and other technologies. We, and our service providers, may send \"cookies\" or use similar technologies to understand and personalize your child's online experience in our Platform or for advertising within the Platform based on the content your child is watching.\n\nCookies are small text files placed in a browser. We may also use pixels or \"web beacons\" that monitor your child's use of our Platform for the purposes noted above. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a webpage for the purpose of transferring data. We may also integrate \"Software Development Kits\" (\"SDKs\") into our applications to perform similar functions as cookies and web beacons. For example, SDKs may collect technical and usage information such as mobile device identifiers and your interactions with the Platform.\n\nWe may also use cookies and other technologies (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our content and our Platform, products, and programs and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our Platform and content, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, and (v) for us to offer, market, or advertise products, programs, or services.\n\nManaging cookies and other technologies. Cookies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). Check your browser settings to learn how to delete cookies.\n\nYou may adjust a browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Controlling cookies via browser controls may not limit our use of other technologies. Please consult the browser's settings for more information. However, blocking cookies or similar technology might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Platform features.\n\nSome of our sites may use Google Analytics to analyze traffic. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage. To opt-out of Google Analytics relating to your child's use of our Platform, you can download and install the Browser Plugin available via this link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.\n\nWe do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.\n\nInternational Transfer\n\nWe operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based in the United States. This means the information we collect will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. The Platform is currently limited to accounts in the United States. However, if your child uses or visits our Platform from outside the United States, you consent to the collection and/or processing in the United States of information we collect from them.\n\nSecurity\n\nWe take reasonable steps to help safeguard the information we collect. However, no security measures are perfect, and we cannot assure you that personal information that we collect will never be accessed or used in in an unauthorized way.\n\nYour Rights\n\nYou can make certain requests regarding the personal information we collect from your child.  For instance, you may access this information, request that we delete it, and/or prohibit us from further collecting or using any information from your child. You or your adult can make these requests through our online portal here.\n\nYour California Rights\n\nCalifornia has passed a law named the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which grants California residents certain rights with respect to their personal information. The CCPA has specific rules regarding the use of children's information. In particular, the CCPA says that a parent or guardian must provide permission to sell personal information of users under the age of 13. It also allows you to ask for access to the information collected from a Kid's Profile or to ask us to delete it. Users aged 13-15 can provide permission or exercise these access and deletion rights directly. If you are interested in the rights that the CCPA grants to California residents, please visit the \"California and CCPA Privacy Rights and Disclosures\" section of the WarnerMedia Privacy Policy here.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you have any questions about this Children's Privacy Policy you may contact us at: WMPrivacy@warnermediagroup.com or write to us at the following address:\n\nWarnerMedia Privacy Office\nAttention: Chief Privacy Officer\n4000 Warner Blvd., Bldg. 160\nBurbank, CA 91522\nUnited States\n\n833- WM-PRVCY (833-967-7829) or 833-PRVCY-TT (833-778-2988)\nWMPrivacy@warnermediagroup.com\n\nUPDATES\n\nFrom time to time, we may update this Children's Privacy Policy.

When it’s accessible... My List does not always appear in HBO Max. Additionally doesn’t not list all the things you’ve added to it when it does. This is frustrating for people who are trying to watch something they have added, only to have to search for it again. Big no no.\n\nEpisode Selection- watching a show sometimes you miss something, wether you got busy around the house or fell asleep, I know I can find the episodes.. if I search for it again. But unlike other apps I can’t select another episode from the episode I’m in. For example. Netflix on the Xbox, or PlayStation. While watching an episode you can hit (X on Xbox) (square on PS) to view the episode list. Why do I need to search it again. \n\nAll in all I respect the Swift Roll-Out for HBO Max, and switching the subscriptions from HBO to HBO Max. But the Max App for Console and Phone is MISSING vital features to a streaming service. I highly suggest fixing these issues because I don’t want to see your app use slow down or disappear all together. Even after a boost in advertisements, not having these functions could end the popularity of your service. Please consider these thoughts and I hope to look forward to these changes.","title":"Good content, bad User interface","userName":"Goldentoast01"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6874075804","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-01-15T21:15:49Z","rating":2,"review":"I love HBO’s content, and I was very excited when it was announced that the app would allow downloads for offline viewing. However, I was very disappointed to discover that while you can download videos, if you try to watch them in airplane mode (say when, I don’t know, flying on an airplane), the app will let you watch for a while then suddenly freak out and become trapped in an endless loop of error messages as it repeatedly tries and fails to contact the server. This problem has been present for months and it appears no effort has been made to fix it.\n\nAdditionally, the app does not keep accurate track of how many videos you currently have downloaded. There is a global limit for the account of 30 downloaded videos, and if you want to download beyond that you are prompted to delete unwanted videos to stay below the limit. However, when you delete a few videos, the app continues to give you the same error message saying you can’t download more than 30 videos, and does not permit you to download.\n\nThe content on HBO is really great, but I primarily only have time to consume it on flights. It is frustrating beyond belief that this app gets so close to the desired feature a d then totally falls flat on its face in the execution.","title":"Download function is broken and has been for months.","userName":"inuchan"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6768874100","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-12-19T03:28:01Z","rating":1,"review":"When I checked under “App Privacy” in this app, it was immediately concerning to me to see that HBO is tracking me extensively on my iPhone across apps and websites and in a variety of ways: my location, my search history, my usage data, my contact information, my identifiers, and my “other data.“ (Sounds ominous, doesn’t it?) Why is this necessary, HBO? I am paying you each month, so it doesn’t seem as though you need to monetize me like this. Is that what you are doing? It says, “Data Used to Track You: The following data may be used to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.“ If HBO Max were a freebie, I guess I could understand this *to a degree* – but HBO Max bills self as a premium channel, and it is by no means free! It sounds to me like HBO Max needs to do better by its customers’ privacy rights. While I normally would’ve given HBO Max five stars— it truly is a wonderful premium service that I enjoy very much! — I’m giving it one star until this is convincingly explained to me. Oh, and I’m also deleting HBO Max from my iPhone; since I feel it necessary to do that, HBO Max just became a whole lot less valuable to me, and I may also have to reconsider my entire relationship with the company moving forward.","title":"HBO Max: Have I become YOUR product?","userName":"TheTaintedOne"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6549471192","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-10-18T21:29:34Z","rating":2,"review":"I’ve only had the app for a couple of weeks but already it’s got major issues compared to other streaming apps that I am not sure how they aren’t fixing...\nWhen connecting to watch on my TV via Chromecast it will just stop a few episodes (or sometimes halfway into the very first episode I watch) and look like it’s “buffering” but really it’s just a connection issue, or something along those lines and it will never actually resume. The only way to continue watching is to disconnect, restart the app and reconnect which is ridiculous.\nOther issues include some of the user interface irritabilities others have pointed out like the “continue watching” section giving you no options to go to the show details, episode selection, etc. and the fact that you can skip the ads and intros when watching in the app on your device, but not when casting from your device.\nAll of these issues make for a very clunky, unprofessional and honestly overpriced viewing experience. I’m really just binge-watching all the shows I got the subscription for so I can cancel after one month, and resubscribe in the future once they learn how to build a proper streaming app.","title":"Content Good - App Bad","userName":"S.C.

Since I’m a Direct TV customer I was even more excited because it’s included for no extra charge. However, I’m very disappointed to find that not only is there a maximum download limit for the entire household of 30 downloads and worst of all it seems like every time you leave the app screen it pauses your downloads. Perhaps it’s just me but even when I leave the app open in the background while I text or check email I go back to the app screen to find everything was paused while I multitasked. The 30 downloads per household maximum, if you are using all 5 profiles, really limits your ability to download much depending on what the other users download for themselves and frankly if the app can’t/won’t download your selections if you leave it open in the background so you can multitask it will take so long for people like myself to download our selections it becomes counterproductive and makes it far quicker and more efficient to simply buy the series you’re interested.

It has auto play but it only works half the time and you have to listen to the entire credits track unlike on other streaming services where they give you the option to play the next episode once the actual content of an episode ends. It’s casting capability is terrible, a lot of the time when you try to cast you just get a plain black screen on your TV. Other times it’ll cast but every time you leave and then open the app it has disconnected itself from the casting capability while the show is still playing so you can watch it but you can’t control it at all. It does this every single time. It also likes to say you’re offline when you’re clearly not, it mostly does this when I try to access my settings or account information.

It seemed I had to go to the search option to find the show and THEN I could pick the episode I wanted, rather than where I left off (I often fall asleep while it’s on auto play and have to go back.) Also, it keeps giving me the cellular warning over and over, even tho I’ve turned that fiction off in the settings. One time it changed my setting for streaming with cellular data, and wouldn’t play at all until I switched the setting back. So weird. \n\nOne more comment, why does the iPhone app allow you to jump ahead 15 seconds but the browser version on my computer does not?\n\nAll in all the app is okay, and I like the extra content as compared to HBO now. But why the separate version of HBO? Just come out with one for goodness sake!","title":"Functionality not quite there","userName":"Madelinebelton292016"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6386989067","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-02T10:58:18Z","developerResponse":{"id":15761502,"body":"We're listening and appreciate your feedback on HBO Max.

Currently you must click edit, then scroll through your list, X out the download you don’t want, then scroll back up and click Done. It’s a lot of real estate to go through. Secondly, downloads don’t play on their own off of the phone unless the phone is taken off network. So if I have a slow or poor internet connection, shows don’t play immediately  or at all, and I suspect that they’re eating data instead of playing off of my phone. Downloads only play well in these circumstances if I set the phone to Airplane mode. Finally, the Renew option doesn’t work. If I click on the exclamation point to renew, I get a dialog to Renew or Cancel. Click on Renew and nothing happens; no shows or movies renew. I can only get them back if I delete and redownload them.  Like I said, it’s a decent app, but this part proves to be a frustrating experience.","title":"Broken downloads feature","userName":"Shardik"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6714178452","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-12-03T21:32:47Z","rating":1,"review":"What you had before wasn’t good but it was much better than what you guys did with this new update here we go!\n\nHome Screen intro is horrible taking up 80% of the screen displaying content most people do not like or are already watching. Why not make a banner consisting of 25% of the screen with new content did I say new I mean NEW brand NEW. Not Euphoria for Gods sake Euphoria with the girl crying over and over and over again! Show different content from the show not the same face again and again and again makes one hate that show without even watching it. Please be smart don’t fill the whole screen with a 80% poster. You are not convincing people to watch what you want them to watch they are smarter than that.  \n\nHow about categories like 70s, 80s, 90s, blockbusters, Globe Awards, Indies things like that! FOR YOU omg that is so annoying  bunch of shows that I would never watch at all let alone select them for MY LIST. Speaking of My List put that first under the 25% New show Banner that’s better.

The problem I have with it is how the parental controls are set up. It is backwards of how it should be. You should have to enter a parental control pin to access adult content (if that’s what you choose) but instead you enter a pin to exit a kids profile. I set up profiles for me, my wife, and my three kids. If my wife or I are watching something on our profile and  exit without changing it to one of the kid’s profiles, the kids have full access to the adult profile when they launch HBO Max. Defeats the whole purpose of having restricted content profiles. The other thing that doesn’t make sense is the parental control pin. When you change profiles and are prompted to enter the pin, it shows the pin as you enter it and displays the whole pin before you hit enter. So if your kids are in the room and you’re doing this on your tv, they can see the pin. If HBO Max had parental controls and pin the same as Netflix (or Prime even), would be 5 stars. Hopefully the developers can fix this.","title":"Parental Control (and Pin)
