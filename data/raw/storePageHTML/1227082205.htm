It's a private place for just the two of you. Whether you've just moved in together, or you've been married for years, Merge is guaranteed to immediately improve household communication. \n\n\nCreate tasks among these four categories:\n\n- CHORES is meant for household chores\n- SHOP is meant for groceries and anything else you may need\n- VOTE is for collaborating and coordinating on decisions big and small\n- PAY allows you to organize lists of payments, such as rent.\n\n\nFor each kind of task you can:\n\n- Set due dates\n- Create reminders\n- Sync reminders with Apple Reminders\n- Make tasks recurring\n- Set task urgency\n- Reassign tasks \n- Edit tasks\n- Add #hashtags to create sublists, e.g., add #camping to all tasks related to your next camping trip to be able to view them in one combined list\n\nAdditional features includes:\n- Merge Status: a quick and easy way to check in with your partner throughout the day.

For pricing, please see the In-App Purchases section on this screen.  A paid membership subscription to Merge enables access to the service beyond the free trial period.  It includes unlimited access to all features.  You may cancel at anytime.  If you cancel within free trial period, you will not be charged.  Subscriptions are correlated with the administrative partner's Apple ID and the couple that was created when initially signing up.  Only one subscription per couple is necessary/possible.  Apple currently does not allow subscription charges to be shared across two or more Apple ID's, therefore only the administrative partner in the couple will be charged.  The prices of said subscription are subject to change at the discretion of the Company for any reason and at any time.  Prices are not guaranteed to be carried over from previous subscriptions.  Payment will be charged to the iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.  Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.  Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hous prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of renewal.

Subscriptions are correlated with the administrative partner&#39;s Apple ID and the couple that was created when initially signing up.  Only one subscription per couple is necessary/possible.  Apple currently does not allow subscription charges to be shared across two or more Apple ID&#39;s, therefore only the administrative partner in the couple will be charged.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Edit: After using the app for a while, we found that list services like AnyList got the job done much better. As far as bill management and chores, it is very easy to make your own lists at home on paper or even find an app designed for chores. Nothing here that is not available for free on other apps.<br /><br />I like this app so far. It seems pretty convenient. I think it would benefit from a shared calendar. Something that you can input your schedule so that your partner can see it. That way you can make appointments and plans based on your partners schedule inside the app, rather than using google or another service. If you want to be a full couple organiser and planner, you need a calendar.<br />Another thing you could add is a shared photo album? But that is not pivotal.<br />The option to change the color would be nice as well.</p>

We are currently consider a potential redesign that would incorporate such a feature, including the ability for more customization of lists (including colors).  We have been delightfully overwhelmed by the App of the Day feature and will be spending the next few weeks planning on next steps.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I think this app is easier to use than some reviewers are giving it credit for. When I got my first IPhone I didn’t know how to do anything either, but it quickly became second nature. I think the learning curve here is pretty short. Also have to give the developers credit for their considerate responses and efforts to improve. This is my first review and I’m only really leaving it because I know it will be considered by the devs. The app is less than a year old, so you’re probably gonna hit a bug here and there, but I’ve also only had the app a day and there’s already been an update released. Finding it very useful so far- keep up the great work! <br /><br />I agree with the requests to be able to show all chores, and edit the texts of list items- but I know you’re working on that.<br />One other very helpful feature for us would be to add a “calendar” tab. We each have weekly time commitments that sometimes change days, and it would be GREAT to be able to peek at the app and see your partner’s weekly schedule. Nothing fancy, just to mark “I’ll be at _______ on ____day between ___am and ___pm”. Much easier than messing around with google calendar, or other such things. Maybe color coded by partner to distinguish the entries? Just a thought!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Thank you for your detailed feedback!  A “view all” feature was initially available but was removed to simplify things.  However, we have received several request to bring it back.  As soon as we figure out a way to present it without over complicating the interface, we’ll re-add it.  A calendar feature is also currently being designed, based on member feedback.  We’ll certainly take your recommendations into consideration.  Important is that it works seamlessly with the existing design and is easy to use, just as you mention.  We’ll keep you posted on the status of these new features in our update notes.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love the idea behind this app and my wife and I were super excited to start using it, I was full intending on getting the year subscription if it lived up to what it said it could do. At first it seemed great, but then I went to add our monthly bills into it and it won’t allow me to add the payments under “both”, I just could do it under only me or only my wife. Not a huge deal, I figured maybe I was doing something wrong or it was a bug that could be fixed. But when I clicked on Contact Support, it wouldn’t do anything, as if the link was dead. I then went to the App Store to try and find a way to contact, and it took me to their website, which does not have a way of contacting, which was a bit frustrating. I am hoping with this 1 Star review I will be given a way to contact support, that way these issues, as well as with any future issues that may come up, I can actually get them resolved. If I can get this resolved and have an actual way of contacting support, I will gladly change to 5 stars. I understand glitches happen, but being able to contact support to notify of issues and get them resolved would be great.</p>

For pricing, please see the In-App Purchases section on this screen.  A paid membership subscription to Merge enables access to the service beyond the free trial period.  It includes unlimited access to all features.  You may cancel at anytime.  If you cancel within free trial period, you will not be charged.  Subscriptions are correlated with the administrative partner's Apple ID and the couple that was created when initially signing up.  Only one subscription per couple is necessary/possible.  Apple currently does not allow subscription charges to be shared across two or more Apple ID's, therefore only the administrative partner in the couple will be charged.  The prices of said subscription are subject to change at the discretion of the Company for any reason and at any time.  Prices are not guaranteed to be carried over from previous subscriptions.  Payment will be charged to the iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.  Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.  Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hous prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of renewal.  Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase.

As far as bill management and chores, it is very easy to make your own lists at home on paper or even find an app designed for chores. Nothing here that is not available for free on other apps.\n\nI like this app so far. It seems pretty convenient. I think it would benefit from a shared calendar. Something that you can input your schedule so that your partner can see it. That way you can make appointments and plans based on your partners schedule inside the app, rather than using google or another service. If you want to be a full couple organiser and planner, you need a calendar.\nAnother thing you could add is a shared photo album?

When I got my first IPhone I didn’t know how to do anything either, but it quickly became second nature. I think the learning curve here is pretty short. Also have to give the developers credit for their considerate responses and efforts to improve. This is my first review and I’m only really leaving it because I know it will be considered by the devs. The app is less than a year old, so you’re probably gonna hit a bug here and there, but I’ve also only had the app a day and there’s already been an update released. Finding it very useful so far- keep up the great work! \n\nI agree with the requests to be able to show all chores, and edit the texts of list items- but I know you’re working on that.\nOne other very helpful feature for us would be to add a “calendar” tab. We each have weekly time commitments that sometimes change days, and it would be GREAT to be able to peek at the app and see your partner’s weekly schedule. Nothing fancy, just to mark “I’ll be at _______ on ____day between ___am and ___pm”. Much easier than messing around with google calendar, or other such things.

Not a huge deal, I figured maybe I was doing something wrong or it was a bug that could be fixed. But when I clicked on Contact Support, it wouldn’t do anything, as if the link was dead. I then went to the App Store to try and find a way to contact, and it took me to their website, which does not have a way of contacting, which was a bit frustrating.

We realize that, more than anything, a thorough usage tutorial is necessary for an upcoming update.  In any case, we hope that you will ultimately find our design convenient and useful.

You can’t change it you have to delete it.”\n\nA: When creating a task, instead of pressing the check mark on the right side above the keyboard to submit the task, please press the clock icon on the left side.  This will open a due date dialog where you can set a due date, urgency, and recurrence.  In order to edit the time and set a reminder, swipe right on the task.\n\n\nQ: “...Also you can’t change who it’s assigned to.”\n\nA: Please swipe left on a task and tap the button with the clipboard and back arrow.  This will allow you to reassign a task\n\n\nQ: “...Default “chore for me” is checked. But then if I go to edit it you can only edit the title nothing else...”\n\nA: Please swipe right on the cell to edit time and remind information.\n\n\nQ: “...Also in the future or through another app you should add the ability for throuples (3 person) or poly or just add family....”\n\nA: As of now, we are focused on couples, but the opportunity to expand is certainly worthwhile.  We hope to perfect the experience for couples first before we tackle any further challenges.\n\n\nQ: “You can’t add pictures to chores. This is simple but it’s hard to get used to. You’re like “how do I do everything?...”\n\nA: Pictures is a great idea.  We have looked into this in the past, and it is becoming increasingly more relevant.  We’ve added it to the feature board for further consideration.  We’d like to ensure, above all, that it doesn’t clutter the interface and provides enough value to all of our couples.\n\n\nQ: “...Okay I created this chore now how do I change things about it without deleting it?” Answer is you can’t.”\n\nA: Please swipe right to edit the due date and reminder, and swipe left to add a comment, reassign, edit the text, and delete.  If we are misunderstanding your issue, please email us at hello@merge.fyi.  Our top priority is to ensure your success with Merge.\n\n\nAgain, thank for this incredibly detailed feedback.

I was really excited about this app because it look like it was perfect for exactly what we needed, but it doesn’t save any time if it continues to crash every time you try to use it. Will there be a fix for this anytime soon?

For pricing, please see the In-App Purchases section on this screen.  A paid membership subscription to Merge enables access to the service beyond the free trial period.  It includes unlimited access to all features.  You may cancel at anytime.  If you cancel within free trial period, you will not be charged.  Subscriptions are correlated with the administrative partner's Apple ID and the couple that was created when initially signing up.  Only one subscription per couple is necessary/possible.  Apple currently does not allow subscription charges to be shared across two or more Apple ID's, therefore only the administrative partner in the couple will be charged.  The prices of said subscription are subject to change at the discretion of the Company for any reason and at any time.  Prices are not guaranteed to be carried over from previous subscriptions.  Payment will be charged to the iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.  Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.  Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hous prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of renewal.  Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase.  For more information, please visit http://www.merge.fyi/terms and http://www.merge.fyi/privacy.  Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication where applicable."},"versionHistory":[{"versionDisplay":"0.9.5","releaseNotes":"Hello and thank you for continuing to use Merge.

Trust, transparency, and privacy are the most important things when it comes to both relationships and the digital services we use. On Merge, you own and control your personal data. We will not serve ads and will NEVER sell or share your personal data, identifiable or non-identifiable, to outside third party marketers, advertisers, researchers, or developers. Data and content submitted to Merge by you will only ever be used internally to improve your app experience.\n\nA subscription still covers both you and your partner, and the first month is free. You may cancel anytime. If you cancel during the first month trial, you will not be charged. You may also request to have your personally identifiable information permanently deleted at anytime.\n\nWe want more than anything for all couples to have access to our service, but we must take into consideration our needs as a business. When we weighed out whether or not we were willing to ever sell any of your sensitive data, whether identifiable or not, to third party marketers, advertisers, researchers or developers, as many companies do, we decided that it was not in our best interest ethically or economically. Relationships are private, and your trust is everything to us.\n\nTherefore, we are announcing that we have done away with the freemium model. We have switched to a transparent, simple, old-school buyer-seller model, and are completely cutting out the potential for any irrelevant third parties to ever get their hands on your information. This means that all new members must subscribe upon sign up. All existing members must subscribe to continue using the service. All premium features are now standard. The first month is free for all members, new or existing.  Current subscribers, there's no change. For those existing members who have been enjoying the freemium version of Merge, and wish to stop using the service and have their personally identifiable information permanently deleted, please contact us at hello@merge.fyi.\n\nThank you and we look forward to embarking on this new chapter with you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour Merge Team\n\nPlease see our updated Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for more details, and contact us at hello@mergy.fyi with any questions.\n\nThank you for continuing to use Merge.
