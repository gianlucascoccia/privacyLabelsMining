      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Indeed I was surprised at the variety of the articles covering the entire world and not just the US, the on point editorials and the fact that most of the articles are available to all. Like The Guardian, The NY Times, The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times (which remain the leaders of investigative journalism) we need these voices of the free press to counteract the lies and deceit of conspiracy theories. You tell USA Today your subjects of interests and it advises you daily on happenings in your domain.<br />Only a few world class independent papers are left from the Globe and Mail in Canada to the Kansas City Star which was the first to point out that Josh Hawley was no hero but a traitor to the country and an embarrassment.<br />On television we luckily have many independent networks from Manoto in London to the mainstream networks in Canada, the UK (in fact most of Europe except Belarus and Russia) the US and Australia, as well as the global CNN. If more people consulted one or more of these balanced new sources, fake news would not survive even among the uneducated. I miss the days when people shared good articles, cartoons and opinions they read in the quality press as opposed to trashy propaganda networks and the destructive agenda of corrupt millionaire right wingers on the radio purporting to support the well being of all.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I actually work for Gannett (USA Today’s parent company)- but as unbiased as I can be - this app is awesome. They are a solid company &amp; provide a well designed app to the everyday person even to the news junkies. As a company - They don’t look to invade your privacy, they have great leadership, they have incredible people working for them and dedicated &amp; award winning reporters who look to bring real news to the people. They are a company who looks to help humanity, further all beings &amp; bring legitimate unbiased news and services in the best of ways. Get the app, select your news preferences, allow the notifications. It’s a lot (as far as notifications go) if you want it to be, but it’s worth it to be updated on the things you want to know. Well done as an app for an employee, or for anyone, and for everyone. Especially during these times. Thanks all.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Number one most frustrating issue:  every time you set the phone down or switch apps and come back the story you were reading scrolls back to the top of the article. Super annoying and serves absolutely no purpose. Can’t imagine this would be hard to correct, so please make this stop. I beg you. <br /><br />Second, and this is a compound issue: the main news feed refreshes too often. In the past, the top stories section was just that. Just the most newsworthy stories of the moment. Now, you have packed seemingly every story on the platform all into the top stories section. Well, I could live with that except as I work my way through the never ending list of articles, the app refreshes the feed every so often making me lose my place. To add to the nuisance, all the stories are now in a different order so I can’t really ever get back to where I was. <br /><br />Please pick one or the other:  1) go back to the perfectly logical way you had it before where the top stories were indeed the top stories and I will go into the individual sections for more depth on what I want more of, or 2) turn off the occasional refresh and let me do that whenever I feel the need.  It’s fine if it refreshes when you open the app, just not during an active session.</p>

Please take the time to read the Privacy Notice. You consent to the data collection, use, sharing practices described in this Privacy Notice when you use this site.\n\n\nWhat's new in the updated Privacy Notice?\nMost importantly, we inform you that we may use the information that we collect while you are using our Website or Apps (collectively, “Services”), and we may authorize our affiliates and service providers to use such information, to mail or email promotional offers directly to you, even if you have not specifically informed us that you would like to receive such promotional offers. However, we do provide information on how to contact us to ask us to stop the collection, storage or use of your information. \n\nOther important changes are listed below.\n\n1.Our Privacy Notice now applies to all of our Services whether you access them through a computer, tablet, smartphone or other device. \n\n2.We may use and share information that you provide, or that we collect and store, including emails and other personal information. \n\nUse: We may email or mail you communications, including promotional messages, using the contact information we collect while you are using the Services. \nSharing: We may share information we collect and store while you are using the Services or other sites with affiliates, service providers, and third party advertising service providers for their own use, including advertising and sending promotional messages. \n3.In connection with ad serving and ad targeting on our Services, we notify you that in some cases, device identifying information could be used to identify you personally. \n\nWe provide additional information on how to contact us to ask us or others to stop the collection, storage or use of your information. We also note that you can stop all collection of information from our Apps by uninstalling the Apps. If you have any questions about this Privacy Notice, our privacy practices, or your dealings with us, please contact: \n\nAndrea Shandell\nOnline Privacy Coordinator \nGannett Law Department\n7950 Jones Branch Drive\nMcLean, VA 22107\n\n\nLast Updated: February 3, 2016\n\nWe take seriously your interest in how your information is collected and used. Please read the following to understand about our privacy practices.\n\n\nThis Privacy Notice discloses the privacy practices of our Websites, whether accessed through a computer, tablet, smartphone or other device (individually or collectively, “Device” or “Devices”), and our Apps. Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using our Websites or Apps (collectively, “Services”) or other websites, and the ways in which we use and share this information. This Privacy Notice does not apply to any information you may provide to us, or that we may collect, offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail). In addition, this Privacy Notice does not apply to our non-digital products and services. Please read this Privacy Notice carefully. By using the Services, you agree that your use of our Services, and any dispute over our online privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Notice and our Terms of Service . Because the web and apps are evolving media, we may need to change our Privacy Notice at some point in the future, in which case we'll post the revised Privacy Notice on our Websites or Apps. If we make a significant change in the way we collect, use or share your information, the change will be posted on this page thirty (30) days before the change takes effect. We will also update the \"Last Updated\" date to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Services after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Notice as modified. Your access of the Services for the limited and exclusive purpose of reviewing this Privacy Notice does not constitute your acceptance of this Privacy Notice unless you make any further use or access of our Services. \n\n\nYour California Privacy Rights\n\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the \"Shine The Light\" law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to:\n\nAndrea Shandell\nOnline Privacy Coordinator\nGannett Law Department\n7950 Jones Branch Drive\nMcLean, VA 22107\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nCollection. We collect information that you give us and information that is automatically collected. \nUse. We use the information for the purpose you gave it to us (for example, to register or make a purchase); to provide content and advertising; to contact you; and for other purposes. \nShare. We share the information with our service providers and affiliates to administer the Services; to provide content for the Services; to provide advertising on the Services; and for other purposes. We also share the information with other third parties to provide advertising on the Services, on other sites and apps, and for other purposes. \n\n\nPlease read the rest of this notice for complete details.\n\n\n\n\nHow We Collect Information \n\nThe information that we collect about you while you are using our Services falls into two general categories: information you provide to us, and information that is automatically collected. All of the information we collect may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a vendor providing contractual services to us, such as a service provider. \n\n1. Information You Provide to Us. \n\nWe may collect and store information that you voluntarily supply to us while using our Services, including information you send to us by email or other platforms in connection with a feature provided through the Services. This may include information that can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone numbers, birthdate and gender. Some examples of this type of information include: \n\ninformation that you electronically submit when you contact us with questions or participate in contests, surveys or sweepstakes; \ninformation that you post on blogs, discussion forums or other community posting and social networking areas accessed through our Services; \ninformation and content you provide when you upload a photograph, video or audio file;\ninformation that you electronically submit when you complete an online registration form to access and use certain features of our Services; \ninformation that you provide within an advertisement on one of our Services; and \ninformation contained in search requests that you submit through our Services. \nWe also may ask for information (including a credit card number and other financial information) from those users who make purchases or have payment transactions through our Services.\n\n2. Information that is Automatically Collected. \nWe also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you use our Services. Some examples of this type of information include: \n\nwhether you downloaded an App; \nthe source of the download of the App (for example, through a particular advertisement for the App); \nyour Device’s connection to the Internet; \nyour browser or operating system; •which pages you visit through our Services and how often; \nwhich features of our Services you interact with and how often; \nwhich advertisements we serve to you and your engagement with them; and \ninformation generated when you upload a photograph, video or audio file. \nIn addition, certain Devices and browsers contain unique identifiers that can be used to identify other information about your Device. When you use such a Device or browser to access our Services, your Device and/or your browser may automatically collect and/or transmit your Device's unique identifier, IP address, MAC address, profile information (if you connect through a social network such as Facebook), location information, the make and model of your Device, the wireless provider associated with your Device, and similar information. We may ask you whether we may access and collect your location information even when you are not using the Services, but you may decline this request. \n\nWe also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a \"cookie\" to enhance your experience with our Services. Cookies are small files that your web browser or an App places on your Device for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Services or other websites, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences for certain Services when you have entered preference information before. We also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as \"transparent GIFs\") to access cookies and to count users who use the Services or other websites. Additionally, we may assign an anonymous identifier to the tracking pixel or session cookie. \n\nWe, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as local storage, in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings (see below). The method for disabling local storage will vary depending on your browser and device. \n\n\n\n3. Your Choices. \n\nWhen we request information from you through our Services, you may always choose not to provide us with that information. But if you decline to supply or provide us with certain information while using our Services, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through our Services. \n\nIf you want to limit the information that is automatically collected while you use our Services or other websites, most web browsers allow you to disable certain functionality or set certain privacy settings. If you choose to disable cookies or turn off other functionality, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Services. \n\nYou can stop all future collection of information by the Apps by uninstalling the Apps according to the procedures outlined in the Apps or on your Device. \n\n\n\n4. Collection of Information by Service Providers and Third-Party Advertising Service Providers. \n\nIn addition, our service providers and third-party advertising service providers may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect the information listed above from our Services. The data collected in connection with the ad serving and ad targeting through our Services does not include your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, birthdate or gender unless you affirmatively provide information within the ad. However, it may include Device identifying information such as the IP address, MAC address, cookie or other Device-specific unique ID. These service providers also may assign an anonymous identifier to the tracking pixel or session cookie. \n\nThe collection of information by our service providers and third-party advertising service providers is governed by their relevant privacy notices, for which we have no responsibility or liability, and are not covered by our Privacy Notice.

Please read the following to understand about our privacy practices.\n\n\nThis Privacy Notice discloses the privacy practices of our Websites, whether accessed through a computer, tablet, smartphone or other device (individually or collectively, “Device” or “Devices”), and our Apps. Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using our Websites or Apps (collectively, “Services”) or other websites, and the ways in which we use and share this information. This Privacy Notice does not apply to any information you may provide to us, or that we may collect, offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail). In addition, this Privacy Notice does not apply to our non-digital products and services. Please read this Privacy Notice carefully. By using the Services, you agree that your use of our Services, and any dispute over our online privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Notice and our Terms of Service . Because the web and apps are evolving media, we may need to change our Privacy Notice at some point in the future, in which case we'll post the revised Privacy Notice on our Websites or Apps. If we make a significant change in the way we collect, use or share your information, the change will be posted on this page thirty (30) days before the change takes effect. We will also update the \"Last Updated\" date to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Services after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Notice as modified. Your access of the Services for the limited and exclusive purpose of reviewing this Privacy Notice does not constitute your acceptance of this Privacy Notice unless you make any further use or access of our Services. \n\n\nYour California Privacy Rights\n\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the \"Shine The Light\" law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to:\n\nAndrea Shandell\nOnline Privacy Coordinator\nGannett Law Department\n7950 Jones Branch Drive\nMcLean, VA 22107\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nCollection. We collect information that you give us and information that is automatically collected. \nUse. We use the information for the purpose you gave it to us (for example, to register or make a purchase); to provide content and advertising; to contact you; and for other purposes. \nShare. We share the information with our service providers and affiliates to administer the Services; to provide content for the Services; to provide advertising on the Services; and for other purposes. We also share the information with other third parties to provide advertising on the Services, on other sites and apps, and for other purposes. \n\n\nPlease read the rest of this notice for complete details.\n\n\n\n\nHow We Collect Information \n\nThe information that we collect about you while you are using our Services falls into two general categories: information you provide to us, and information that is automatically collected. All of the information we collect may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a vendor providing contractual services to us, such as a service provider. \n\n1. Information You Provide to Us. \n\nWe may collect and store information that you voluntarily supply to us while using our Services, including information you send to us by email or other platforms in connection with a feature provided through the Services. This may include information that can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone numbers, birthdate and gender. Some examples of this type of information include: \n\ninformation that you electronically submit when you contact us with questions or participate in contests, surveys or sweepstakes; \ninformation that you post on blogs, discussion forums or other community posting and social networking areas accessed through our Services; \ninformation and content you provide when you upload a photograph, video or audio file;\ninformation that you electronically submit when you complete an online registration form to access and use certain features of our Services; \ninformation that you provide within an advertisement on one of our Services; and \ninformation contained in search requests that you submit through our Services. \nWe also may ask for information (including a credit card number and other financial information) from those users who make purchases or have payment transactions through our Services.\n\n2. Information that is Automatically Collected. \nWe also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you use our Services. Some examples of this type of information include: \n\nwhether you downloaded an App; \nthe source of the download of the App (for example, through a particular advertisement for the App); \nyour Device’s connection to the Internet; \nyour browser or operating system; •which pages you visit through our Services and how often; \nwhich features of our Services you interact with and how often; \nwhich advertisements we serve to you and your engagement with them; and \ninformation generated when you upload a photograph, video or audio file. \nIn addition, certain Devices and browsers contain unique identifiers that can be used to identify other information about your Device. When you use such a Device or browser to access our Services, your Device and/or your browser may automatically collect and/or transmit your Device's unique identifier, IP address, MAC address, profile information (if you connect through a social network such as Facebook), location information, the make and model of your Device, the wireless provider associated with your Device, and similar information. We may ask you whether we may access and collect your location information even when you are not using the Services, but you may decline this request. \n\nWe also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a \"cookie\" to enhance your experience with our Services. Cookies are small files that your web browser or an App places on your Device for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Services or other websites, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences for certain Services when you have entered preference information before. We also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as \"transparent GIFs\") to access cookies and to count users who use the Services or other websites. Additionally, we may assign an anonymous identifier to the tracking pixel or session cookie. \n\nWe, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as local storage, in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings (see below). The method for disabling local storage will vary depending on your browser and device. \n\n\n\n3. Your Choices. \n\nWhen we request information from you through our Services, you may always choose not to provide us with that information. But if you decline to supply or provide us with certain information while using our Services, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through our Services. \n\nIf you want to limit the information that is automatically collected while you use our Services or other websites, most web browsers allow you to disable certain functionality or set certain privacy settings. If you choose to disable cookies or turn off other functionality, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Services. \n\nYou can stop all future collection of information by the Apps by uninstalling the Apps according to the procedures outlined in the Apps or on your Device. \n\n\n\n4. Collection of Information by Service Providers and Third-Party Advertising Service Providers. \n\nIn addition, our service providers and third-party advertising service providers may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect the information listed above from our Services. The data collected in connection with the ad serving and ad targeting through our Services does not include your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, birthdate or gender unless you affirmatively provide information within the ad. However, it may include Device identifying information such as the IP address, MAC address, cookie or other Device-specific unique ID. These service providers also may assign an anonymous identifier to the tracking pixel or session cookie. \n\nThe collection of information by our service providers and third-party advertising service providers is governed by their relevant privacy notices, for which we have no responsibility or liability, and are not covered by our Privacy Notice. If you have any questions regarding the privacy notice of one of our service providers, you should contact the service provider directly for more information. \n\nIf you would like more information about the information collection practices of a particular third-party advertising service provider, or if you would like more information on how to opt out of a third-party advertising service provider’s information collection practices, go to www.aboutads.info, or for apps, at www.aboutads.info/appchoices. \n\nAdditionally, some of our third-party advertising service providers are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\"). You can obtain more information about these third-party advertising service providers' information collection practices, and opt out of such practices (and at the same time opt out of the collection practices of other, or all, NAI members) by following the opt out instructions on the NAI's website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.\n\nPlease note that one of our third-party advertising service providers is DoubleClick.

The technical or aggregate information may be based on data that includes your information and such items as type of pages viewed and categories of interest. These service providers, third-party advertising service providers, affiliates, third parties and advertisers may use their own browser or flash cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect technical information (such as Device unique identifier, IP address, MAC address, browser type, pages visited, and location information) that is generated automatically as a user views or interacts with an ad. These service providers, third-party advertising service providers, affiliates, third parties and advertisers may use that information, sometimes in conjunction with similar information gathered through other websites and other sources, to deliver advertisements through the Services or for other promotional purposes. They also may use that information to deliver advertisements, or for other promotional purposes, on other websites, as well as on other websites that participate in our third-party advertising service providers’ advertising networks, which are tailored to match the perceived interests of consumers. The information obtained by service providers, third-party advertising service providers, affiliates, third parties and advertisers also may be used to help measure and research an advertisement’s effectiveness, or for other purposes. \n\nIf you log into the Services with a social media service or you connect a social media account with the Services, we may share your information with that social media service. The social media services’ use of the shared information will be governed by the social media services’ privacy policy and your social media account settings, for which we have no responsibility or liability. If you do not want your information shared in this way, do not log into the Services through a social media service and do not connect your social media account with the Services. \n\nIf you do not wish certain information to be shared for these purposes, send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator, whose contact information is listed at the end of this Privacy Notice. \n\nSharing for Other Purposes. Please be aware that we may occasionally release information about you if required to do so by law or if, in our business judgment, such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to enforce our Terms of Service or (c) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of our Services, us, our affiliates, our officers, directors, employees, representatives, our licensors, other users, and/or the public.\n\nPlease also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. If we sell some or all of our assets, or our Services are acquired by another company, information collected about our Services’ users may be among the transferred assets. \n\n\nAd Serving and Targeting Choices\n\nWe operate in compliance with the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, www.aboutads.info. \n\nPlease keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information or other private information available for viewing by third parties online -- for example on blogs, discussion forums, or other community posting or social networking areas offered through our Services -- that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us.

You tell USA Today your subjects of interests and it advises you daily on happenings in your domain.\nOnly a few world class independent papers are left from the Globe and Mail in Canada to the Kansas City Star which was the first to point out that Josh Hawley was no hero but a traitor to the country and an embarrassment.\nOn television we luckily have many independent networks from Manoto in London to the mainstream networks in Canada, the UK (in fact most of Europe except Belarus and Russia) the US and Australia, as well as the global CNN. If more people consulted one or more of these balanced new sources, fake news would not survive even among the uneducated.

To make matters worse, the developer contacted me via email and stated that they fixed this issue based on my previous review and as it stands it still isn’t corrected so this make me think even worse towards the app. Conclusion, the app used to be great, and straightforward to use it has started to veer off course for whatever reason 🤷🏻‍♂️ In my opinion probably better to try out different news source apps. \n\n(PREVIOUS REVIEW)\nI’ve been using the app with USA for many many years now BUT.....while it’s still my preferred news, I’m beginning to question it and possibly look into other reliable news source because the newer user interface is too commercialized.

That’s increasingly hard to find these days, other outlets I appreciate because they state their leanings. I wish the news didn’t lean a certain way, but at least they put the proper disclaimer on it. Like a movie properly rating itself so you understand what you are about to view. You and other news outlets should strongly consider this course of action. It’s disingenuous and misleading to act objective while simultaneously pushing an obviously liberal/progressive agenda. Your editorial board and contributors are liberal leaning at the very least. I’ve seen you post opposing opinions, but overwhelmingly the opinions expressed here are liberal and it doesn’t take a conservative or trump supporter to see that, of which I am neither. I personally feel we all have a bias of some sort, but some are more willing to address and correct it than others. I personally actively try to dismantle my own arguments regularly to see if they can withstand basic scrutiny. Perhaps your network should consider doing the same, or simply state your bias. That would be a good first step toward better serving the people who consume your content.","title":"You’re liberally bias, I have no issue with bias if you state it.

I like it except for the way they have implemented the videos where they play an advertisement before the video. The problem is they play the same advertisement segments over and over! After a while you get so sick of hearing them that you would never by what they are advertising! The current most annoying thing is that they are slow to show the ads they have in static text articles. So you are reading along and then the text suddenly scrolls down so that you are in a different part of the article! It’s simply maddening! So now you have to scroll back up a screen or two to find your place! It’s kind of like a while back when the ads would hang and you couldn’t watch the video! I am not sure if the problem is my slow internet it their bad programming skills! When they are adding the ad content that is off the screen they SHOULD NOT CHANGE THE SCROLL!\nI am guessing that the guys programming this do not use it on their iPhone otherwise they would not make such an obvious mistake.","title":"Over all it's good, video implementation is bad","userName":"Midwest_Surf_Guy"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3006002292","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-08-02T12:45:08Z","rating":1,"review":"I've had this app for many years.  While it's gotten prettier to look at, it's gotten less useful as time goes on.  Absolutely every time I use it, the app shuts down on me no less than three times before I've scrolled all the way through the Top Stories. Also, there are now paid advertisements that look like stories, right within the midst of the real news.  If you're not careful, you're actually reading advertisements from sources like The Motley Fool and others. This is deceptive, and rather cheap of USA Today to fund their app this way.  Other news apps do not take this approach.  On the whole, USA Today app doesn't always have the latest news. I'll read a story from another news source on Twitter that was posted several hours ago, and I'll head to the USA Today app for more information, only to see they haven't even written about it yet. It's usually there by the end of the day, but it's half a day behind other news outlets.  On the whole, USA Today is a pretty app that doesn't always work, has paid advertising peppered throughout their real stories and is usually behind other apps in posting the latest news.","title":"Pretty, but no longer useful","userName":"KLstil"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2072017775","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-01-09T12:20:07Z","developerResponse":{"id":3229257,"body":"Our apologies, this was not intentional but we’ve resolved this poor experience in our latest app release.

Today, after many updates to the UI it is now one of the most dysfunctional apps with a user experience that delivers the maximum amount of annoyance. While its AP and broad network content remains, that content is buried beneath a confused, glitchy interface that prioritizes junk trending articles and video advertisements that take over the screen and audio. Moving through the platform, trying to uncover the quality content, and reading articles is a joyless and even torturous run through an obstacle course of “features” that fight for attention and keep the words of the news articles jumping around the screen out of view. The very idea of reading - which is the central activity of news readers is insulted by a UI that  has the design markers of a member of the zero attention span Snapchat Generation. No participation trophy for you, this app is a failure. A failure which gets worse and less content prioritized with each quarterly update.","title":"This app has lost its way","userName":"Magneticnorth124789"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1925831487","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2017-11-16T19:58:40Z","rating":5,"review":"Overall, I’ve enjoyed and appreciated the USA Today app on my iPhone and iPad for several years. Good content, reasonable balance. I do perceive a bit of a liberal/left bias, but in their defense, they do post opinion pieces from a conservative viewpoint, and they do a good job of identifying and labeling opinions that may be biased when they are posted. \n\nMy only criticism with the current app is that the text shifts forward in the article as the ads load, and causes sections of articles to be skipped ahead. This happens sometimes 2-3 times while reading an article—definitely frustrating when trying to read through the article. (I’m trusting this problem will be addressed.)\n\nOverall, a good source of information that I’ll continue to use.","title":"Good Content, But Text Shifts Too Quickly","userName":"JV58"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4466143645","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-07-15T16:34:52Z","rating":1,"review":"This used to be a great newspaper with reporters that gave unbiased opinions.
