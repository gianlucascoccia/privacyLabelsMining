A LivePhish HiFi monthly subscription is $19.99 per month and the yearly subscription is 199.99 per year.\n\nBoth monthly plans begin with a 7 Day free trial and the yearly plans begin with a 30 Day free trial.\n\nPayment will be charged to the iTunes Account at the end of your trial period if applicable, otherwise at the time of your purchase.\n\nSubscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\nAccounts will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.  \n\nSubscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the users Account Settings after purchase.\n\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nLivePhish Terms of Use - https://www.livephish.com/terms.aspx\nLivePhish Privacy Policy - https://www.livephish.com/privacy.aspx","screenshot":["https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/ad/05/5b/ad055bf0-671f-1752-b788-e448a0fb7f2c/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/02/7d/ca/027dca59-457b-3ff7-049b-47e2032b8a0c/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/a4/79/c0/a479c074-4a90-d572-a10c-25aac3962b5b/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/db/ea/f0/dbeaf08f-48af-2cbc-5e84-93c8be4bb613/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/b0/3b/74/b03b7449-d862-774e-ade0-41d010fc0450/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/28/3a/2e/283a2eb0-e591-85c7-3283-38a8831b326d/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/28/92/e5/2892e5b1-c934-5e42-b897-66d753e4f440/pr_source.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/7d/1d/57/7d1d5728-e5c1-ce4f-d01a-95cf112ebaa0/mzl.nccyzgax.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/8e/b8/30/8eb83010-46db-ee43-e37e-4b8a3af324ba/mzl.ndydfmij.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/f1/f9/4e/f1f94e84-5dbd-6bec-06c1-0418647a38e8/mzl.eogghaqq.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/77/0a/0c/770a0c37-3f90-a2e0-0996-a9ddc625faad/mzl.cwqbujdr.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/51/6f/f0/516ff04f-986e-be50-684b-5c44eecaf0da/mzl.gkowzhib.jpg/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/1f/43/1a/1f431a64-7821-5209-743e-4f1fc5d6d20f/pr_source.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/f9/31/eb/f931eb0c-ef78-90cf-18c9-4cb5f91623fb/pr_source.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/e8/8b/27/e88b2714-1cf4-d073-be13-85d234c03aee/pr_source.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/a0/79/63/a07963f9-31a3-788f-9e9a-97e6879951af/mzl.mpxchuom.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/eb/56/62/eb5662eb-0d67-c527-1ece-53603a2d0100/pr_source.png/643x0w.jpg"],"image":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/4a/af/bc/4aafbcec-5378-da67-7b4b-7804154f9eac/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/1200x630wa.png","applicationCategory":"Music","datePublished":"Jun 12, 2010","operatingSystem":"Requires iOS 12.0 or later.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This app is great! Little to no issues or glitches. Definitely no more than any other app I use. I also use the live phish+ site on my computer at work. That site is flawless...nice work fellas. My advice is fork out the 10 bucks and support a band you love. Ive been digging the 90’s soundboards that have been released lately. Keep those coming! The recently added video feature is a nice upgrade and I’m going to use  the app to airplay the webcast on my Apple TV tonight. This is the true test 😉.<br /><br />Update: The app worked perfectly using airplay to my Apple TV! The quality was exceptional! I could even use other apps on my phone while the airplay feature was on. The only i app I had problems with interrupting the airplay was google chrome. Overall this exceeded my expectations.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Obviously the best music—this review has nothing to do with the music, just the app.  It’s gotten better, but still clunky.<br />Would be better if the menu was consistent whether you’re in “browse,” “playlists,” etc. Developers: to see what I mean, browse to tours, summer 18, for example, then to a playlist, then back to summer 18. It’s like 10 steps in each direction. <br />I love the big jams, so I’ve been making a lot of playlists. They’re hard to edit, even from the computer/website. Adding sorting functions like “sort by date” and “move to top” would be amazing!!! Also, the ability to remove a song from a playlist “on the go” would be a nice bonus. The other suggestions would be better though.<br />Strangely, if you’re streaming and you get/make a phone call, after the call the track starts over. Not a big deal if you’re listening to a band that plays 3-minute songs. But not ideal when you’re 25 minutes into a track.<br />I would also add a function where you can see all videos. But that would just be icing on the cheesecake.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Thanks Phish! I&#39;ve had a monthly subscription for years, don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without it. I&#39;ve never experienced any problems, not sure why so many 1 star reviews.  Only suggestion would be an update to include ability to select multiple tracks from show to add to playlist without having to add each track individually. <br /><br />Listen to the latest show, updated daily when on tour. Also 5 full shows available for stream, usually a mixed variety of  80s, 90s, 2000s. Plus access to anything youve ever purchased from live phish or new inapp purchases. An absolute bargain. Occasional MINOR glitches are no big deal. Devs still updating content regularly whether band is on or in between tour. Thanks guys!!</p>

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy describes the information we collect, what we do with it, and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at livephish.com.  Please review our privacy policy as it may change from time to time in the future (when we change the policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy) and contact us at help@livephish.com if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nThe Information We Collect\n\nAt livephish.com and livephish.com websites, you can order products, express an opinion, and subscribe to services such as online newsletters and paid streaming. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, location, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, contact preferences, credit card information, Internet protocol address, date of birth, and details of how you use and interact with our websites (e.g. your search queries, a record of customer service emails, access dates and times, referring website addresses).\n\nAt some parts of some of our websites, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.\n\nWe also may collect some non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g. Safari, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using and information about your Internet service provider (e.g. Comcast, AT\u0026T) or device (e.g. iPhone 6, MacBook Pro) and other user-related general data (e.g. zip code, area code).\n\nHow We Use the Information\n\nWe may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you.  We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when a concert you have purchased is available for download or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us.  If you enter into a giveaway, contest or other promotion, we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.\n\nThe information we collect in connection with our website is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you new products, programs, or services.  As is the case with most Internet services, we obtain some information automatically and store it in log files.  We use this and other information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our products and services, and to gather demographic information about our users.  We may use this information to market and advertise our products and services.\n\nYou are not required to provide any personally-identifiable information that we have requested, but if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any questions you may have.\n\nWe sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience.

We also may disclose such information to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, intellectual property violations, security or technical issues, to protect our operations or users, or to respond to a law enforcement agency's request.  Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger or sale we may transfer any and all information we collect to the relevant third party.\n\nAgents and contractors of livephish.com who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for livephish.com.  Agents and contractors of livephish.com will comply with all laws regulating these matters, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU).\n\nAlthough we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.\n\nFinally, livephish.com websites will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.

Definitely no more than any other app I use. I also use the live phish+ site on my computer at work. That site is flawless...nice work fellas. My advice is fork out the 10 bucks and support a band you love. Ive been digging the 90’s soundboards that have been released lately. Keep those coming! The recently added video feature is a nice upgrade and I’m going to use  the app to airplay the webcast on my Apple TV tonight. This is the true test 😉.\n\nUpdate: The app worked perfectly using airplay to my Apple TV! The quality was exceptional! I could even use other apps on my phone while the airplay feature was on.

It’s like 10 steps in each direction. \nI love the big jams, so I’ve been making a lot of playlists. They’re hard to edit, even from the computer/website. Adding sorting functions like “sort by date” and “move to top” would be amazing!!! Also, the ability to remove a song from a playlist “on the go” would be a nice bonus. The other suggestions would be better though.\nStrangely, if you’re streaming and you get/make a phone call, after the call the track starts over. Not a big deal if you’re listening to a band that plays 3-minute songs. But not ideal when you’re 25 minutes into a track.\nI would also add a function where you can see all videos.

Seriously if you try to even attempt to playback a show that you haven’t “saved off-line” and happen to be driving at the same time. Frustration takes over and driving suddenly takes a backseat to reloading, closing, starting over, searching, and possibly throwing said phone out the window. It works great off Wi-Fi... no issues whatsoever, and the HD is man-i-fic! Outside of Wi-Fi? You have a better chance of getting a song from a mockingbird tied up with glue and rubber bands. UNLESS! You save some shows off-line, and boot up the app while in range of your Wi-Fi. Then you can listen to ANY of the 10 or so shows you chose from the ENTIRE released catalog.

However, some improvements are needed to make this a truly great app, including:\n- remembering where you left off, even if it’s been a few hours or days since listening. This is my biggest complaint, as it’s not always obvious which show I was listening to last, and it’s annoying and time consuming to have to bring the show back up. \n- improved playback performance over Bluetooth and WiFi speakers (occasionally the playing just stops, and I’ll need to manually resume or play the next song). \n- ability to review or tag shows in some way, either just for personal viewing or for the community at large. \n- more videos!!\n- and finally, a built in sleep timer would be nice so I don’t have to use the iOS timer.
