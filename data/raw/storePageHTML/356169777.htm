      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Love the app, great courses, but for whatever strange reason while on my iPhone 11, I cannot scrub forwards or backwards one in landscape mode. So, when in landscape mode with the display locked, I wind up having to rotate my phone to make the charge port to the left instead of the right. And my only other criticism is that on occasion I get booted back to the main screen what I’m trying to look for a course through the catalog. These are all minor annoyance is that I’m sure can be fixed in a future revision. Otherwise, love the app, love the courses, overall great service.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is the most incredible learning resource I have seen anywhere, any time, bar none. During the 15+ years I have subscribed, the course list has expanded exponentially. Most of the negative reviews I have read are about annoying glitches that I attribute to growing pains of the platform. I am willing to put up with that, given the value of the app.<br /><br />I am a photographer. What started out as a great resource for Photoshop and Lightroom has grown to cover photographic techniques, gear, principles, business aspects (Quickbooks), creating portfolios, marketing, and on and on. At various times over the years when money was tight, I did without some other things rather than let my Lynda subscription lapse. <br /><br /> One of the many things I have always liked is that older videos are not removed when a new product video appears. Therefore I am not forced into always buying the latest and greatest. For example I can still view the entire course on Photoshop CS4 if I am still using that version of the software.<br /><br />All this and yet no obtrusive ads or popup videos to dilute the experience.<br /><br />Thanks Lynda and keep up the good work.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve tried to expand my knowledge of media via a variety of online outlets. Lynda’s content and video quality far exceeds other avenues I’ve tried. Each course is extremely practical. <br /><br />The only glitch I’ve noticed is sometimes when I’ve completed a course, the site won’t recognize it’s been completed and erases the record of me watching a particular segment. I have to go back to that segment and go through it again, sometimes with more than one segment, and that can be a little annoying. <br /><br />Overall though, I HIGHLY recommend this as a learning platform, and I require all my interns to sign up so they’ll also have this resource at their disposal.</p>

INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU\n\nWe collect several types of information about visitors and/or users of our Services. We may collect this information either directly when you provide it to us or automatically as you navigate through the Websites or App.\n\n(a) Personally Identifiable Information. ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ refers to information by which you may be personally identified, such as your name, email address, or school. We will collect and process such data about you when you register for a Service/create an account, subscribe to a newsletter, submit feedback, enter a contest, fill out a survey, or send us a communication. When ordering products or services on the Websites or App, you may also be asked to provide a credit card number and other payment-related information. You may also provide information to be published or displayed (“posted”) on public areas of the Websites (such as blogs, forums, message boards, and the like), or transmitted to other users of the Websites using ‘sharing’ features (collectively, “User Contributions”). Your User Contributions are posted and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Websites with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.\n\nWe may also collect your Internet Protocol (‘IP’) address. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Services and to gather demographic information.\n\nWe do not collect more Personally Identifiable Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity on the Websites. If you are a school and you use a Lynda.com service within the United States for children under the age of 13, you are responsible for obtaining consent from the parents/legal guardians of each child you wish to allow to participate in using any of our Services. A child using our Services will be able to participate in certain activities such as taking online educational and informational courses.\n\n(b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We may collect, or our third party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information, that does not by itself identify a specific individual. Such information tells us about your equipment, browsing actions, the resources that you access and use through the Services, your operating system and browser type. Our third party ad servers will provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at our Websites. The information that we collect automatically is ‘statistical’ in nature. It helps us to deliver a better and more personalized service to users, by enabling us to estimate usage patterns, customize our Services according to your individual preferences, and speed up your searches.\n\n(c) Device Information. When you download our App and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use and the operating system version, so we know the best application version to provide you with. We do not ask you for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our App or Services.\n2. WHERE WE STORE DATA\n\nThe data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. Lynda.com will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION\n\nWe use information held about you in the following ways:\n\n    To ensure that content from our Services is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer or mobile device\n    To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes\n    To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection\n    If you pay for Services using a credit card, we will transmit your credit card data to the appropriate credit card company and/or credit card payment processing company\n    To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Services, when you choose to do so\n    To notify you about changes to our Services\n    In any other way we may describe when you provide the information\n\nIf you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you.\n\nIf you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this.\n\nIf you use the Contact Us form on our site, we will respond to your inquiry and delete the information provided after your request has been fulfilled.\n4. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION\n\nWe will share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. Parents have the right to allow the collection and use of Personal Information from a Child without also consenting to its disclosure to Third Parties. We do not sell, trade, rent or disclose your information to others, except as provided herein:\n\n(a) We provide some of our Services through contractual arrangements with service providers and other third parties. We and our service partners use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our Websites and to deliver Services. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on our Websites; release your address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide order information to third parties that help us deliver the services.\n\n(b) We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in the following circumstances: (i) if it is required by law enforcement or judicial authorities, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation; (ii) if we have a good faith belief that we are required or permitted to do so by law or legal process; (iii) to protect the rights, reputation, property or safety of Lynda.com or others; (iv) to defend or enforce our rights or your obligations; (v) if the disclosure is required by mandatory professional standards; (vi) to a 3rd party with your prior consent to do so; or (vii) if we are under a duty to disclose or share your Personally Identifiable Information in order to enforce or apply, or any contracts or agreement that may exist between you and Lynda.com including this Privacy Policy and our Website Use Policy. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.\n\n(c) In the event that Lynda.com decides to sell all or part of its stock or assets or enter into a merger, we reserve the right to include Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information among the assets transferred to the acquiring or surviving company.\n\n(d) We may provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers’ sales, traffic patterns, and related Website information to third party advertisers.\n\n(e) Parents are able to consent to the use of their child’s Personally Identifiable Information without having to consent to the Website’s disclosure of the child’s Personally Identifiable Information to third parties, as we do not share Personally Identifiable Information of children under the age of 13 with any third parties (other than those service partners who help us provide the Lynda.com service to you).\n\nFor a list of 3rd party trackers and the information that may be shared with or collected by such 3rd parties, please click here: Lynda.com 3rd parties\n\nIf you have any inquiries regarding our privacy practices, please contact us directly at businessaffairs@lynda.com.\n5. UPDATING OR CORRECTING YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\n\nYou may change any of your or your child’s Personally Identifiable Information online by logging into ‘My Account’ in accordance with instructions posted elsewhere on our Websites.\n\nYou may also access, request deletion, and correct yours or your child’s personal information and privacy preferences by contacting support@lynda.com or by emailing us at businessaffairs@lynda.com, or writing to us at:\n\nLynda.com, Inc.\n6410 Via Real\nCarpinteria, CA 93013\nAttn: Business Affairs\n\nPlease include your or your child’s name, address, and e-mail address when you contact us. We encourage you to promptly update your or your child’s Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on yours or your child’s account deleted or removed and request that we no longer have contact with your child; however, because we keep track of past transactions for as long as is reasonably necessary, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on this Website. In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because of backups.\n6. CANCELING YOUR ACCOUNT OR DELETING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION\n\nIf you are a LyndaPro member and would like to cancel your membership, log in to your account and go to My Account, Account + Billing. You can also contact your sales representatives or contact support@lynda.com.\n\nIf you are LyndaKiosk, LyndaCampus, or LyndaEnterprise and would like to cancel your membership, please contact your sales representatives or contact support@lynda.com. To have any personally identifiable information deleted, please contact: support@lynda.com.\n\nWe will retain your or your child’s information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services.

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.\n7. CHOICES REGARDING CONTROL OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION\n\nYou can access some of the information that we collect about you or your child. For example, by logging in to your account, you can access information regarding recent orders from the Websites; Personally Identifiable Information; communication preferences; and payment settings.\n\nWith respect to your communications preferences, you can unsubscribe from newsletters by following the instructions included in the newsletter you receive or you can log into your account and update your newsletter and email subscription options. If your e-mail address has changed and you would like to continue to receive newsletters, you will need to access your account and update your e-mail address information in your account and sign-up again for the newsletter. Occasionally we may send out e-mails concerning website disruptions.\n\nIf you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from us and our partners, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only Lynda.com (or agents working on behalf of us and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings, and only if you did not later ‘opt-out’ of such offers.\n\nWe do not send unsolicited commercial e-mails (“spam”). We offer commercial e-mail recipients the opportunity to opt-out of further communications in every e-mail. Please note that we may not include the opt-out information in non-commercial Service e-mails (i.e., e-mails concerning your order, the Website Terms of Service, etc.).\n\nYou also have choices with respect to cookies, as described below. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies some parts of our Websites may not work properly in your case.\n8. INFORMATION RELATED TO DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE LYNDA.COM PLATFORM SERVICE\n\nFor certain services Lynda.com collects information under the direction of its clients (e.g., an entity that subscribes to the Services for use by the entity’s personnel). In this respect, Lynda.com acts as a data processor and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personally Identifiable Information it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his or her query to the relevant Lynda.com client (the data controller). If the client makes a request to us to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 days.\n\nLynda.com will retain Personally Identifiable Information we process on behalf of our clients for as long as needed to provide our services to our client. We will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.\n9. DATA SECURITY\n\nAll information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.\n\nTo make online purchases you must use an SSL-enabled browser in order to protect the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.\n\nAccess by you to your account is available through a password and/or unique user name selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone, that you change your password often using a combination of letters and numbers, and that you ensure you use a secure web browser. We cannot be held accountable for activity that results from your own neglect to safeguard the secrecy of your password and user name. If you share a computer with anyone, you should always log out of your account after you are finished, in order to prevent access to your information from subsequent users of that computer.\n\nPlease notify us as soon as possible if your user name or password is compromised. Call 1 (888) 335-9632 or +1 (805) 477-3900 for assistance, or email businessaffairs@lynda.com.\n\nUnfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Website cannot be guaranteed and we shall have no liability to you or any third party for loss, misuse, disclosure or alteration of such information; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.\n\nIn the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personally Identifiable Information in our control may have been compromised, we will notify you as promptly as possible under the circumstances. To the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail and you consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at businessaffairs@lynda.com with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.\n10.

We use Flash cookies in certain situations where we use Flash to provide some content such as video clips or animation. The options within your browser may not prevent the setting of Flash cookies. To manage Flash cookies please click here: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html.\n11.

Additionally, other companies that place advertising on our Websites may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.\n13.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY\n\nIt is our policy to post any changes we make to our Privacy Policy on this page (with a notice that the Privacy Policy has been updated on the home pages of the Websites). If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ information, we will notify you by e-mail to the primary e-mail address specified in your account and through a notice on the home pages of the Websites.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU\n\nWe collect several types of information about visitors and/or users of our Services. We may collect this information either directly when you provide it to us or automatically as you navigate through the Websites or App.\n\n(a) Personally Identifiable Information. ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ refers to information by which you may be personally identified, such as your name, email address, or school. We will collect and process such data about you when you register for a Service/create an account, subscribe to a newsletter, submit feedback, enter a contest, fill out a survey, or send us a communication. When ordering products or services on the Websites or App, you may also be asked to provide a credit card number and other payment-related information. You may also provide information to be published or displayed (“posted”) on public areas of the Websites (such as blogs, forums, message boards, and the like), or transmitted to other users of the Websites using ‘sharing’ features (collectively, “User Contributions”). Your User Contributions are posted and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Websites with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.\n\nWe may also collect your Internet Protocol (‘IP’) address. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Services and to gather demographic information.\n\nWe do not collect more Personally Identifiable Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity on the Websites. If you are a school and you use a Lynda.com service within the United States for children under the age of 13, you are responsible for obtaining consent from the parents/legal guardians of each child you wish to allow to participate in using any of our Services. A child using our Services will be able to participate in certain activities such as taking online educational and informational courses.\n\n(b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We may collect, or our third party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information, that does not by itself identify a specific individual. Such information tells us about your equipment, browsing actions, the resources that you access and use through the Services, your operating system and browser type. Our third party ad servers will provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at our Websites. The information that we collect automatically is ‘statistical’ in nature. It helps us to deliver a better and more personalized service to users, by enabling us to estimate usage patterns, customize our Services according to your individual preferences, and speed up your searches.\n\n(c) Device Information. When you download our App and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use and the operating system version, so we know the best application version to provide you with. We do not ask you for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our App or Services.\n2. WHERE WE STORE DATA\n\nThe data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. Lynda.com will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION\n\nWe use information held about you in the following ways:\n\n    To ensure that content from our Services is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer or mobile device\n    To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes\n    To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection\n    If you pay for Services using a credit card, we will transmit your credit card data to the appropriate credit card company and/or credit card payment processing company\n    To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Services, when you choose to do so\n    To notify you about changes to our Services\n    In any other way we may describe when you provide the information\n\nIf you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you.\n\nIf you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this.\n\nIf you use the Contact Us form on our site, we will respond to your inquiry and delete the information provided after your request has been fulfilled.\n4. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION\n\nWe will share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. Parents have the right to allow the collection and use of Personal Information from a Child without also consenting to its disclosure to Third Parties. We do not sell, trade, rent or disclose your information to others, except as provided herein:\n\n(a) We provide some of our Services through contractual arrangements with service providers and other third parties. We and our service partners use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our Websites and to deliver Services. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on our Websites; release your address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide order information to third parties that help us deliver the services.\n\n(b) We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in the following circumstances: (i) if it is required by law enforcement or judicial authorities, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation; (ii) if we have a good faith belief that we are required or permitted to do so by law or legal process; (iii) to protect the rights, reputation, property or safety of Lynda.com or others; (iv) to defend or enforce our rights or your obligations; (v) if the disclosure is required by mandatory professional standards; (vi) to a 3rd party with your prior consent to do so; or (vii) if we are under a duty to disclose or share your Personally Identifiable Information in order to enforce or apply, or any contracts or agreement that may exist between you and Lynda.com including this Privacy Policy and our Website Use Policy. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.\n\n(c) In the event that Lynda.com decides to sell all or part of its stock or assets or enter into a merger, we reserve the right to include Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information among the assets transferred to the acquiring or surviving company.\n\n(d) We may provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers’ sales, traffic patterns, and related Website information to third party advertisers.\n\n(e) Parents are able to consent to the use of their child’s Personally Identifiable Information without having to consent to the Website’s disclosure of the child’s Personally Identifiable Information to third parties, as we do not share Personally Identifiable Information of children under the age of 13 with any third parties (other than those service partners who help us provide the Lynda.com service to you).\n\nFor a list of 3rd party trackers and the information that may be shared with or collected by such 3rd parties, please click here: Lynda.com 3rd parties\n\nIf you have any inquiries regarding our privacy practices, please contact us directly at businessaffairs@lynda.com.\n5. UPDATING OR CORRECTING YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION\n\nYou may change any of your or your child’s Personally Identifiable Information online by logging into ‘My Account’ in accordance with instructions posted elsewhere on our Websites.\n\nYou may also access, request deletion, and correct yours or your child’s personal information and privacy preferences by contacting support@lynda.com or by emailing us at businessaffairs@lynda.com, or writing to us at:\n\nLynda.com, Inc.\n6410 Via Real\nCarpinteria, CA 93013\nAttn: Business Affairs\n\nPlease include your or your child’s name, address, and e-mail address when you contact us. We encourage you to promptly update your or your child’s Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on yours or your child’s account deleted or removed and request that we no longer have contact with your child; however, because we keep track of past transactions for as long as is reasonably necessary, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on this Website. In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because of backups.\n6. CANCELING YOUR ACCOUNT OR DELETING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION\n\nIf you are a LyndaPro member and would like to cancel your membership, log in to your account and go to My Account, Account + Billing. You can also contact your sales representatives or contact support@lynda.com.\n\nIf you are LyndaKiosk, LyndaCampus, or LyndaEnterprise and would like to cancel your membership, please contact your sales representatives or contact support@lynda.com. To have any personally identifiable information deleted, please contact: support@lynda.com.\n\nWe will retain your or your child’s information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services. If you wish to cancel your or your child’s account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you Services contact us at support@lynda.com. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.\n7. CHOICES REGARDING CONTROL OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION\n\nYou can access some of the information that we collect about you or your child. For example, by logging in to your account, you can access information regarding recent orders from the Websites; Personally Identifiable Information; communication preferences; and payment settings.\n\nWith respect to your communications preferences, you can unsubscribe from newsletters by following the instructions included in the newsletter you receive or you can log into your account and update your newsletter and email subscription options. If your e-mail address has changed and you would like to continue to receive newsletters, you will need to access your account and update your e-mail address information in your account and sign-up again for the newsletter. Occasionally we may send out e-mails concerning website disruptions.\n\nIf you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from us and our partners, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only Lynda.com (or agents working on behalf of us and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings, and only if you did not later ‘opt-out’ of such offers.\n\nWe do not send unsolicited commercial e-mails (“spam”). We offer commercial e-mail recipients the opportunity to opt-out of further communications in every e-mail. Please note that we may not include the opt-out information in non-commercial Service e-mails (i.e., e-mails concerning your order, the Website Terms of Service, etc.).\n\nYou also have choices with respect to cookies, as described below. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies some parts of our Websites may not work properly in your case.\n8. INFORMATION RELATED TO DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE LYNDA.COM PLATFORM SERVICE\n\nFor certain services Lynda.com collects information under the direction of its clients (e.g., an entity that subscribes to the Services for use by the entity’s personnel). In this respect, Lynda.com acts as a data processor and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personally Identifiable Information it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his or her query to the relevant Lynda.com client (the data controller). If the client makes a request to us to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 days.\n\nLynda.com will retain Personally Identifiable Information we process on behalf of our clients for as long as needed to provide our services to our client. We will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.\n9. DATA SECURITY\n\nAll information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.\n\nTo make online purchases you must use an SSL-enabled browser in order to protect the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.\n\nAccess by you to your account is available through a password and/or unique user name selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone, that you change your password often using a combination of letters and numbers, and that you ensure you use a secure web browser. We cannot be held accountable for activity that results from your own neglect to safeguard the secrecy of your password and user name. If you share a computer with anyone, you should always log out of your account after you are finished, in order to prevent access to your information from subsequent users of that computer.\n\nPlease notify us as soon as possible if your user name or password is compromised. Call 1 (888) 335-9632 or +1 (805) 477-3900 for assistance, or email businessaffairs@lynda.com.\n\nUnfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Website cannot be guaranteed and we shall have no liability to you or any third party for loss, misuse, disclosure or alteration of such information; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.\n\nIn the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personally Identifiable Information in our control may have been compromised, we will notify you as promptly as possible under the circumstances. To the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail and you consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at businessaffairs@lynda.com with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.\n10. COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES\n\nWhen you use our Websites we may use cookies and other technologies in order to facilitate and customize your use of our Services.\n\nWhat is a cookie?

During the 15+ years I have subscribed, the course list has expanded exponentially. Most of the negative reviews I have read are about annoying glitches that I attribute to growing pains of the platform. I am willing to put up with that, given the value of the app.\n\nI am a photographer. What started out as a great resource for Photoshop and Lightroom has grown to cover photographic techniques, gear, principles, business aspects (Quickbooks), creating portfolios, marketing, and on and on. At various times over the years when money was tight, I did without some other things rather than let my Lynda subscription lapse. \n\n One of the many things I have always liked is that older videos are not removed when a new product video appears. Therefore I am not forced into always buying the latest and greatest. For example I can still view the entire course on Photoshop CS4 if I am still using that version of the software.\n\nAll this and yet no obtrusive ads or popup videos to dilute the experience.\n\nThanks Lynda and keep up the good work.","title":"Subscriber since early 2000’s","userName":"Pwags66"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3756444487","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-02-11T04:15:57Z","rating":5,"review":"I’ve tried to expand my knowledge of media via a variety of online outlets.

I have to go back to that segment and go through it again, sometimes with more than one segment, and that can be a little annoying. \n\nOverall though, I HIGHLY recommend this as a learning platform, and I require all my interns to sign up so they’ll also have this resource at their disposal.","title":"Very satisfied!","userName":"lzarsky"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5280569771","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-12-16T18:51:57Z","rating":5,"review":"There seems to be an issue with the back button and the done button overlapping each other while playing a video.
