      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This was a great find for our homeschooling family.. I can play books to extend school lessons and also great bedtime books which quickly became part of my kids’ nightly story routine.<br />Even seeing some of our favorites brought to life with various, creative methods of animation is quite an exciting experience for us. My early reader really likes that he can easily follow along with the words as they light up. The content and book choice has not been in the least bit disappointing, there’s some really great books for so many areas of life, brought to life for you! Gotta love it! I got a free trial but I’ll tell you what, this one might be worth paying for after it’s over, and frankly my kids might be very upset to lose this as an option. I can’t let them navigate my kindle reader as freely because they could be lead to books from all over. Vooks is a super safe bet if you need a quick thing to pop on for younger kids, because even if some topics are over their head, they’re never going to be inappropriate for kids. Love it!!! I say 10 stars!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>My elementary aged kids love this app. I love it also but what else is wonderful is there are activities that go with the animated story books (on their website) so it’s more than just enjoying a good story. There is a large quantity of books with the subscription compared to other apps and services. The quality of the books and animation is stellar. The organization of the books by age, topic and etc make it easy for you to supplement with the theme you are teaching. App runs smoothly and no bugs I have experienced yet. I feel confident in the safety and quality of the materials. You could let your child use this app on their own without worry. I’m especially looking forward to delving into some of the biographies next. 5 well earned stars for Vooks app.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>We have never downloaded a kid app yet (4yr-old and 2-yr old) and I was unsure about the slippery slope of them begging for screen time.   We got Vooks to supplement our book collection since we cannot go to the library during the pandemic.   I am pleased to report this app is darling and pretty darn close to reading a real book only BETTER.   Keeps their attention and encourages their love of reading.  And gives this momma a quick break during all of this quarantine business.   I am so thankful I found this app.   We will definitely keep our subscription indefinitely.  Thank you!</p>

I can play books to extend school lessons and also great bedtime books which quickly became part of my kids’ nightly story routine.\nEven seeing some of our favorites brought to life with various, creative methods of animation is quite an exciting experience for us. My early reader really likes that he can easily follow along with the words as they light up. The content and book choice has not been in the least bit disappointing, there’s some really great books for so many areas of life, brought to life for you! Gotta love it! I got a free trial but I’ll tell you what, this one might be worth paying for after it’s over, and frankly my kids might be very upset to lose this as an option. I can’t let them navigate my kindle reader as freely because they could be lead to books from all over. Vooks is a super safe bet if you need a quick thing to pop on for younger kids, because even if some topics are over their head, they’re never going to be inappropriate for kids. Love it!!!

The organization of the books by age, topic and etc make it easy for you to supplement with the theme you are teaching. App runs smoothly and no bugs I have experienced yet.

It offered two subscription plans each with a supposed 7 day free trial period. I chose the yearly and was immediately billed $50+ dollars. This was before I had any chance to evaluate the app as all functionality is hidden behind the paywall. You can’t even see what books are included in the app. Ultimately got a refund through iTunes. Also wasn’t impressed with the app. It leans too far from reading and is more akin to watching TV with subtitles. I prefer similar apps like the Sandra Boynton Load Crow apps that let the child click the words, interact, and develop their reading skills. This is just passive absorption.
