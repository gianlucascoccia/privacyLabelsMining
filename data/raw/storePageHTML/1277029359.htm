      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have downloaded tons of story apps like this one. And this one is by far the best. It&#39;s the one that keeps me up all night playing it. I made my fiancé download just so we can talk about the stories. I don&#39;t even really mind the ticket thing. However, I really mind the diamonds thing. I HATE that to wear certain thing and for certain choices I have to spend my diamonds or my real money to get diamonds. I mean this would cost me a fortune with all the stories I read. Personally, I think locking certain whole stories would be a better option. I much rather spend my money buying the most popular books then spend it on the choices I want to do because you run into a million and that will cost a fortune. It also would set this story app apart from the others because I&#39;ve never see any of them do that. I even talked to my mother in law who had this app and she told me she deleted it because she couldn&#39;t choose what she wanted to choose. It&#39;s the apps biggest down fall. If it was changed, I would say it&#39;s perfect and reccomend it to everyone. I mean heck even the tickets to read a chapter can make you money. There&#39;s no reason for diamonds on choices. You can also through in adds for all I care. As long as I get to choose the choice I want. Hope this doesn&#39;t fall on deaf ears. I love the app tho! A must download.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I might love this app to much. I get to pick what the main character looks like, so I get her as close to me as I can. I get to pick her name so all of them are me lol... the best way to read a book is to put yourself into the main roll, so I do. It is so much fun, then you get to choose what happens, well for the most part. There are tickets for reading the chapters you usually get 2 and it takes an hour for one to be replenished, <br />(you can buy more if you want/need) but to start a new book is free. outfits and some choices cost diamonds (which I wish were less so I could choose more options) they usually cost 12 for a nice out fit/ tempting choice or 17 diamonds for the best outfit/spicy choice so it adds up quickly, however there are choices/outfits that don’t cost, however they usually are not something I would normally choose. But I will sacrifice an outfit for a choice later. I also love the stories. Besides that the other thing I would change is a chance for a back button, I don’t know how many times I have lost control of my phone and as I’m trying to grab it again I have hit the screen and changed the story, or I put it down for a moment and my cat stepped on it and changed it. <br />Also I get often that the system will not let me in please try again later, which is super annoying but it usually corrects itself in a few hours. I would recommend this to everyone that likes to read and make their own choices, however it is super addictive. 😁</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Honestly, I feel like Chapters has the potential to be a really good app, due to the amount of diverse stories there are. However, it’s still lacking in a few things. <br /><br />1. Stories are mediocre at best, but occasionally you’ll find a gem here and there. These stories pander to mostly lonely middle-aged women and fit a very stereotypical scenario most of the time. Chapters has multiple stories that cover a lot of the same tropes over and over...The hot daddy millionaire, boy next door, or your typical vampire love story, the one where the guy is a big tsundere in denial of his love for you and has an extremely toxic personality...Chapters has a little bit of everything for everyone. But the tropes are heavily recycled over and over. This app has so many stories, but lacks diversity when it comes to tropes.<br /><br />2. Diamonds. I know recently Chapters has tried to make it fair for users who don’t pay, but come on...Paying 17 diamonds for choices that basically don’t matter with barely any outcome? That’s a little ridiculous. Especially, when we get very few diamonds after the stories themselves. I wouldn’t have an issue with waiting to collect diamonds, watching ads for them, etc...but choosing diamond choices with little or no outcome is a bit silly. Why not put the diamond choices on the choices that will have a real impact on the story? The “Choices” app does this very well by balancing this out, even if we’re spending 17 diamonds on a choice.</p>

have downloaded tons of story apps like this one. And this one is by far the best. It's the one that keeps me up all night playing it. I made my fiancé download just so we can talk about the stories. I don't even really mind the ticket thing. However, I really mind the diamonds thing. I HATE that to wear certain thing and for certain choices I have to spend my diamonds or my real money to get diamonds. I mean this would cost me a fortune with all the stories I read. Personally, I think locking certain whole stories would be a better option. I much rather spend my money buying the most popular books then spend it on the choices I want to do because you run into a million and that will cost a fortune. It also would set this story app apart from the others because I've never see any of them do that. I even talked to my mother in law who had this app and she told me she deleted it because she couldn't choose what she wanted to choose. It's the apps biggest down fall. If it was changed, I would say it's perfect and reccomend it to everyone. I mean heck even the tickets to read a chapter can make you money. There's no reason for diamonds on choices. You can also through in adds for all I care. As long as I get to choose the choice I want. Hope this doesn't fall on deaf ears. I love the app tho!

I get to pick what the main character looks like, so I get her as close to me as I can. I get to pick her name so all of them are me lol... the best way to read a book is to put yourself into the main roll, so I do. It is so much fun, then you get to choose what happens, well for the most part. There are tickets for reading the chapters you usually get 2 and it takes an hour for one to be replenished, \n(you can buy more if you want/need) but to start a new book is free. outfits and some choices cost diamonds (which I wish were less so I could choose more options) they usually cost 12 for a nice out fit/ tempting choice or 17 diamonds for the best outfit/spicy choice so it adds up quickly, however there are choices/outfits that don’t cost, however they usually are not something I would normally choose. But I will sacrifice an outfit for a choice later. I also love the stories. Besides that the other thing I would change is a chance for a back button, I don’t know how many times I have lost control of my phone and as I’m trying to grab it again I have hit the screen and changed the story, or I put it down for a moment and my cat stepped on it and changed it. \nAlso I get often that the system will not let me in please try again later, which is super annoying but it usually corrects itself in a few hours. I would recommend this to everyone that likes to read and make their own choices, however it is super addictive. 😁","title":"Love this app.","userName":"lil' debbie g"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6354470873","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-08-24T05:00:42Z","developerResponse":{"id":15556423,"body":"Hello!

However, it’s still lacking in a few things. \n\n1. Stories are mediocre at best, but occasionally you’ll find a gem here and there. These stories pander to mostly lonely middle-aged women and fit a very stereotypical scenario most of the time. Chapters has multiple stories that cover a lot of the same tropes over and over...The hot daddy millionaire, boy next door, or your typical vampire love story, the one where the guy is a big tsundere in denial of his love for you and has an extremely toxic personality...Chapters has a little bit of everything for everyone. But the tropes are heavily recycled over and over. This app has so many stories, but lacks diversity when it comes to tropes.\n\n2. Diamonds. I know recently Chapters has tried to make it fair for users who don’t pay, but come on...Paying 17 diamonds for choices that basically don’t matter with barely any outcome? That’s a little ridiculous. Especially, when we get very few diamonds after the stories themselves. I wouldn’t have an issue with waiting to collect diamonds, watching ads for them, etc...but choosing diamond choices with little or no outcome is a bit silly. Why not put the diamond choices on the choices that will have a real impact on the story? The “Choices” app does this very well by balancing this out, even if we’re spending 17 diamonds on a choice.","title":"Has Potential...","userName":"Nekomimiko2014"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5810196251","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-04-14T13:11:24Z","developerResponse":{"id":14795984,"body":"Hello!

The first, it really does have some of the best stories compared to other apps that are similar. The second, it is one of the best money grabs I’ve ever witnessed!!! All of the important choices require you to use diamonds and it seems like every 3rd or 4th choice is an important choice. The choices cost at least 12 or 17 diamonds, some others as much as 20 or 30. There’s usually 3 choices, only one of them won’t require diamonds. Diamonds are hard to come by unless you are willing to buy them, the 30 diamonds for $1.99, get you 2 choices lol. Most stories are anywhere from 14 to 20 chapters and each chapter easily has about 8-10 choices that require diamonds. You can sacrifice outfit choices that require diamonds to save some, it just means you may end up on a date to a benefit gala dressed in a button-up shirt and ankle length pleated skirt!! The choice options are so skillfully crafted too, the free choice is almost always something with a negative outcome. Not all the stories require diamonds for outfits, I’ve come across one with all free outfit choices. Basically if you don’t have a problem with spending so much of your hard earned money on an app like this, you’ll absolutely love it. The game is definitely more focused on making money than providing enjoyment, which is obvious with the selection of choices given to you!!!!","title":"One of the Best!!","userName":"mara0331"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6154616971","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-04T01:56:52Z","rating":5,"review":"I love this game. The stories are great and much like stories I also write. I do wish there were more paranormal stories. Specifically witches. The diamond thing isn’t so bad. 10 dollars a month for a membership seems reasonable. But even without that you can make many choices in many stories. It’s all very thrilling. The one thing I would take note of...definitely give more options for character. I feel like most people want to make a character as similar to them as possible. Unfortunately, in some of the stories, the girls are hideous lol. Women of color should also have more choices as well. What...they get one girl? And Asians get one girl? And usually there is at least 2 different white women to choose from. Or everyone has brown eyes. And I’m a very pale Jewish girl with green eyes and black hair.  So usually no one looks like me haha. I do like that we have multiple hair options though. It would be super cool if we could create a character but I understand that is difficult so just having more options would be nice. :) overall really great game though. Out of interactive stores this rates 2nd for me with arcana being 1st. Idk why choices gets more attention because I really feel that the stories in chapters are way more interesting.","title":"Great game!","userName":"GJFIENDIEKIXKE"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"3759863708","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-02-12T02:26:09Z","rating":2,"review":"I have mixed feelings about the app. I just re-downloaded the app about a week ago, and within that week I’ve come to a few different conclusions. I’ve only read two stories so far. One story I finished, the other I’m on the last few chapters. I can honestly say that I do like the actual stories so far. Both stories that I’ve read have been LGBTQ+ stories, which are the only two LGBT stories I can find. It bothers me that there is barely any diversity on this app. You can’t even really customize the characters to how you’d like them to look. Another thing that bothers me is the diamonds system. Now, I’ve seen this complaint a lot in the reviews. That should say something to the app developers. It’s highly inconvenient that I have to either pay hard earned money for diamonds, or just choose the option without diamonds. How am I supposed to make a choice that costs me 12-20 diamonds when I only have 7, and only get one per finished chapter? Someone in the conference room needs to reevaluate their math skills... Also, the problem with that is, the story will not go the way that I wanted it to. Which makes me disinterested with the book and wanting to just stop reading it and deleting the app altogether. Now, one thing I do like about the app is the taptales. They’re very interesting and don’t require you to make choices, meaning you don’t have to pay for some choices. I really think some drastic changes need to be made immediately.","title":"Conflicted","userName":"Nana 🖤"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2159741829","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-02-03T00:03:35Z","rating":5,"review":"I have played a lot of story apps: Choices, Episodes, Lovestruck, What’s Your Story?, etc. This is honestly one of the best if bot the best one.\n\nLike the rest of these story apps, you need tickets to read a chapter. However, Chapters is the most generous one. In other apps, it takes 2-4 hours to get a single ticket, and most give you a max of two tickets at a time. Chapters also has the standard of two tickets, but regeneration time is only 30 minutes, which is awesome! The timer starts as soon as you use a ticket to start reading, which is nice since some of the other apps don’t start the timer until after you’ve finished reading.\n\nThe best thing about this app is that it doesn’t make me feel like an ATM like the other story apps, which are full of ads and have a many choices that needs to be unlocked with many diamonds/gems. This app also requires diamonds, but it’s not outrageous like other apps which have choices that cost 30-50 diamonds. Most locked choices in Chapters that I’ve seen cost 17 diamonds or less, which I think is very reasonable. I also have never seen an ad.

And it’s always some insane amount of diamonds like 17 when you only get one per completed chapter. The thing that irritates me the most is that every time it’s an option involving diamonds, I ALWAYS want to pick that option. It’s so frustrating. Just like other reviewers have said, I honestly don’t mind the ticket to play system, and you could definitely make a killing off of just that, or do what other apps do, throw in ads every once in a while. This diamond thing makes my blood boil and makes me want to rage delete this app because I can’t pick the options I want to.              ***UPDATE***\n               I used my registration reward to choose the option I really wanted to choose, spent 17 diamonds, and got gypped. After I chose the option something within the story prevented my option from happening. Seriously, what was the point in me even spending those diamonds if what I chose I wanted do wasn’t really even an option? I chose an option to reveal something to a character, and right after the story prevented it by some bs alarm going off making it impossible to tell her.

I have never written a review in my life, but I actually have been enjoying the reading thing and the “idea” of getting to play a part in decisions and the outcome of the story. But that’s literally not the case when it gives you three options, one is of no cost and the other two are required diamonds with is required to pay. Even if you eventually add up all the diamonds you can get watching videos (which is a measly two at a time per video that are scarcely even an option to watch, not a watch and collect at your own leisure) the options are between 12-17 diamonds. I can’t pick and outfit or different decision if I don’t pay for this out of pocket which I currently do not have the option to even do right now as that’s going to get extremely costly. Maybe if it was 5$ for like 1000 diamonds , not 60 of them for that price. After one chapter you’ve just spent 5 dollars on a game that’s supposed to be free. It’s fun but not really as fun as it could be if you actually got to make choices. By the end of a book you’d be paying like 20-50 bucks if you picked your own choice which costs every time it pops up. Sucky.

I mean, if you wanna read a decent (not the best version, just decent) story, you need to spend around 50 gems on each chapter, and let’s say around 1000 gems on each book. And how many of these gems can you get for free? Well at the end of each chapter you only get 2 gems, whoch will cover only 40 out of 1000, and the daily reward which is a total of 12 tickets and 20 gems is only available for the first week (2 free passes for 6 days and 20 gems on the 7th day) (and so are the free pass stories) there are tasks you can do and get gems but there’s only 4 of them and they give you like 3 gems! Oh and there are a limited number of ads you can watch daily and get 1 gem per ad. And why do they think we can invite 30 friends to play this? Who the hell has that many friends? Now you do the calculation. If you use the options costing 17 gems or at least 12 gems you’ll read a nice story, but even one free choice can mess it all up. And what’s worse than all is that you have to pay 30 gems to read the bonus chapter, and if you don’t you’ll literally have no ending!
