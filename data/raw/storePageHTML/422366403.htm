      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>The MTV app is a solid representation of the famed channel in its current form. Users can use the app to watch full episodes and clips of its programming including popular shows such as MTV Teen Mom, My Super Sweet 16, Undressed and many others. Users who have a cable provider account can pretty much watch all available content and those who did not have a limited preview before he ir she is locked out. The app has made sone recent changes with the incorporation of a MTV News section that was formerly another app. While the browsing experience here isn&#39;t as smooth as the former standalone app it gets the job done. Overall navigation in the app is better with a simple scroll up and down the main menu page. The app has allows users to set up notifications for their favorite programs adding in a little customization. For those invested or still invested in MTV the app is well worth a download.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Let me just start off by saying one thing that really bugs me about this app is that it is not consistent with there episodes they upload. For example, if a show aires on cable Thursday, they don’t upload that episode until the following week when a NEW episode aires. Considering I do not have cable, this is highly annoying. More inconveniently, the app NEVER leaves off where I was at in an episode. Not only do I have to remember the EXACT time I left off, but it also doesn’t show the scene when I’m trying to find where I left off. Therefore, I have to literally find where ever I left off. Lastly and more importantly, it is WAY to sensitive to my chrome cast, meaning it disconnects without actually disconnecting to the point I can’t pause the show without completely exiting out of the app, finding the episode I want, and reconnecting to my chrome cast. And it doesn’t even leave off where I was watching after I do this. This happens roughly 3-4 times while watching an episode that I can’t pause it. By the look of the other reviews, this has been an issue for a long time and makes me question how much you people care about what the people who are actually using the app have to say about it.<br />As I’m writing this, I had to pause the episode I’m watching and after only 2 MINUTES of it being paused, I hit play and it started the whole episode ever. Great work mtv.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I know, I get it! This is how they make money is by the ads, however, there is WAY TOO MANY!! I’ll only watch like 5 mins of an episode and there’s already an ad on! Like are you kidding me?! And the ads each are like 3 mins long. Makes it to where I don’t want to watch the show anymore because of how many ads. It’s ridiculous. Even on tv they don’t show a commercial every 5 mins! Unlike this app watching shows seem almost impossible. A couple times I’d be watching a show on my phone and all of a sudden it will skip WAY ahead even when I’m watching it and I NEVER clicked anything, and then another ad plays and I can’t get out of it. Finally once the ad is over, I go back to where I originally was before it skipped lots of parts, and without a surprise, BOOM, another AD! So annoying. I feel like I can’t enjoy the show without an ad coming in a million times an episode and destroying the purpose of it. And not to mention they’re the SAME ADS EVERYTIME. It gets annoying after awhile. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad if they were different ads. I wish they’d get new ones here and there, but not the same ones each time. Please if there’s anyway you can fix this issue, please do. 😤</p>

These Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited. Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. See Section 4(b)(i) for more information on this Site's use of Nielsen's proprietary measurement software to collect and use video viewing metrics and other information.\n\n\n\nThese Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site.

Even if we have a relationship with the Third Party Advertising Service Provider or Advertiser, we do not control their websites or their policies and practices regarding your Information and you should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your Information by third parties in connection with their advertisements or promotions and other sites you encounter on the Internet. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Information that a Third Party Advertising Service Provider or Advertiser may directly collect from you. Use of Third Party Advertising Service Providers' and Advertisers' Tracking Technologies is governed by the Third Party Advertising Service Providers' or Advertisers', as applicable, own specific privacy policies and not this Privacy Policy.

With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, you have a number of options:\n\nYou can prevent the use of certain Tracking Technologies (other than Flash cookies) by using the controls in your Web browser. To do so, you must:\n\nDelete existing Tracking Technologies through the \"Internet Options\" sub-option of the \"Tools\" menu option of your browser or otherwise as directed by your browser's support feature; and\n\nDisable future Tracking Technologies through the same browser controls.

Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. \n\nSome web browsers may transmit \"do-not-track\" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.\n\nWe currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals. Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for online behavioral advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in Sections 4(b)(i), (ii) and (iii).\n\n5. Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities. \n\nMTV may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from MTV, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates for MTV. The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name. Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.\n\n\n\nWe caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.\n\n\n\nUsers that register for MTV's wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from MTV. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will the Site, MTV, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address. \n\n\n\na.Registration. \nTo the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for MTV's wireless marketing services. Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the \"single opt-in\" or the \"double-opt-in\" (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of MTV depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the \"double opt-in\" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.\n\n\n\ni.Single Opt-in Method:\nIn response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to MTV will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to MTV to send text messages to him or her. MTV will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a \"Thank you\" message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from MTV or by sending a text message to MTV that says \"STOP\", \"END\", \"CANCEL\", \"REMOVE\", \"UNSUBSCRIBE\" or \"QUIT\".\n\n\n\nii.Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:\nIn response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to MTV's sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by MTV) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site's registration page. The user must also agree to the Site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement before the online registration process is completed. MTV will then send a \"Confirmation\" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from MTV to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the \"Confirmation\" message with a text message that states \"YES\" or \"Y\" that will indicate the user's acceptance of MTV's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the \"Confirmation\" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the \"Confirmation\" message at any time provided that MTV may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the \"Confirmation\" is only valid if the response is received while MTV continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.\n\n\n\niii.Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:\nIn response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. MTV will then send a \"Confirmation\" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from MTV to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the \"Confirmation\" message with a text message that states \"YES\" or \"Y\" that will indicate the user's acceptance of MTV's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the \"Confirmation\" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the \"Confirmation\" message at any time provided that MTV may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the \"Confirmation\" is only valid if the response is received while MTV continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Termination of Wireless Services by User. \nRegardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from MTV by the following procedure:\n\n\n\nA user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by MTV at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says \"STOP\", \"END\", \"CANCEL\", \"REMOVE\", \"UNSUBSCRIBE\" or \"QUIT\". MTV will terminate the user's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word \"ALL\" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with MTV. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of MTV service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user's previous opt-in.\n\n\n\nc. Termination of Wireless Services by MTV. \nA user understands, acknowledges and agrees that MTV may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. MTV may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd. Use of Information. \nMTV will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use. We will not share any Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure.

We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID.\n\n\n\n\nSee Section 9 of the Terms of Use for how registered users of this Site who are California residents and are under 18 years of age may request removal of content or Information in Postings.  \n\n\nYou may also exercise certain privacy settings options by, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site, clicking \"Profile\" or your display name at the top of the Site, selecting \"Edit Profile\" or \"Manage Account\" and selecting the \"Privacy\" tab.\n\n\nCertain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user's request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.\n\n\nIf the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.\n\n\nChildren or Ineligible Teenagers..\nIf we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (\"Ineligible Teenagers\"), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child's (or Ineligible Teenager's) parent or legal guardian (the \"Parent\") always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).\n\n\n\nIn addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the \"Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use\" Section of the Terms of Use Agreement to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's member; alternatively, Parents may send an email to the Site's Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID and request to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information by any person without the user's User ID. If a Parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child's or Ineligible Teenager's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child's or Ineligible Teenager's date of birth. The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. MTV will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. MTV will then terminate the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.\n\n\n\n\n8.Protection of Information.\n\nWhile no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information. However, regardless of our efforts and the Device you use to access the Site, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the Site. We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality.\n\n\nPhishing.\nPhishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account credentials. \"Phishers\" use 'spoofed' e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers. WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD! If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site's Privacy Administrator at privacy-admin@mtv.com, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.\n\n\n\n\n9.Your California Privacy Rights.\n\nIf you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options such as your right to opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as \"unsubscribe\") or opt-in for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as Advertisers) for marketing purposes. Therefore, pursuant to the California Civil Code, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.\n\n\nIf you are a California resident and wish to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request by email to the Privacy Administrator at privacy-admin@mtv.com or by postal mail to MTV, mtv.com, 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, Attn: Your California Privacy Rights, c/o Privacy Administrator.\n\n\nAll requests must be labeled \"Your California Privacy Rights\" on the email subject line or envelope or post card. For all requests, please clearly state that the request is related to \"Your California Privacy Rights\", include your name, street address, city, state, zip code and e-mail address (your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email) and indicate your preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.\n\n\n\n\n10.Changes to this Privacy Policy and Notice.\n\nWe reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by posting an updated Privacy Policy without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective immediately upon posting. Notice of material changes will be posted on the Site's homepage and/or will be provided by e-mailing you or notifying you upon login about these changes; the form of such notice is at our discretion. However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates.\n\n\n\n\n11.Miscellaneous. \n\na.Accuracy and Confidentiality. It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information, including Personal Information, and to keep such information up to date. We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete information or Personal Information or you fail to update such information or Personal Information. We will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.\n\n\nYou are solely responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your User ID, if applicable, and for any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities and losses we incur or may suffer as a result of your failure to do so. You, and not us, are solely responsible and liable for the activity, behavior, use and conduct on the Site under your User ID (whether used by you or any others who use your User ID), unless and until you notify us that your User ID may have been compromised, misappropriated or improperly taken or used by another party. We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user's account or any services, features or functions.\n\n\nFurther, if you use any of the Communities features and functions made available on or through the Site, please remember that any Information disclosed in these venues is automatically made public and please use caution when disclosing any Personal Information in the Communities, as you do not know who will access and use your Personal Information or for what purposes. MTV is in no way responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any information, including Personal Information, that you disclose or receive through these venues and you should assume that any disclosure you do make in these venues will be available publicly, even without your knowledge or authorization.\n\n\nb.Questions.  If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or if you do not understand any information about how we collect, maintain, use or share your Personal Information or Other Information, you may contact us directly by sending an email to privacy-admin@mtv.com or please contact our Privacy Administrator at MTV, mtv.com, 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, c/o Privacy Administrator.\n\n\nc.Sole Statement: \nThis document is the sole statement of the Site's Privacy Policy and no summary, restatement or other version thereof, or other privacy statement or policy, in any form, including, but not limited to, machine-generated, is valid.\n\n\nd.Other:  Please review our Terms of Use Agreement which governs your use of the Site.

The MTV Channel and the Site (together, \"MTV\") are provided by Viacom Media Networks (\"VMN\"), a division of Viacom International Inc. (together, VMN and Viacom International Inc., the \"Parent Companies\").\n\nThis Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices and covers the following areas:\n\n1.When This Privacy Policy Applies.\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies whether you are accessing the Site via a personal computer, a mobile device or any other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered (each, a \"Device\") and whether you are accessing the Site as a registered user (if offered by the Site) or other user of the Site. This Privacy Policy governs only the Personal Information and Other Information (as those terms are defined below) collected by the Site and does not cover any such information collected in any other manner (such as by the MTV Channel not through the Site) or by any other website offered by MTV, the Parent Companies and/or any subsidiaries and affiliates of the Parent Companies (collectively, \"Affiliates\") or collected by any other company, unless specifically stated. We may from time to time, combine Information (as that term is defined below) with other information we collect from other sources, such as information received from our Parent Companies, Affiliates, marketing companies or Advertisers and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.\n\nThis Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Site or any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered through the Site terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Site or any features, activities or services offered through the Site.\n\n2.U.S. Governing Law; Safe Harbor.\n\nThe Site is designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S. We make no representation that this Site is operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed by, other nations. By participating in our Site activities, you certify that you meet the age and other eligibility requirements for this Site as set forth in our Terms of Use Agreement. If you do not meet such age and other eligibility requirements, please discontinue using the Site immediately as your continued use of the Site indicates that you are agreeing to the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Information as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nIf you are located in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") and Switzerland, for detailed information on our privacy policy and practices with respect to personal information transferred from the EEA and Switzerland, please see our Safe Harbor Privacy Policy located at http://www.viacom.com/privacypolicy/Documents/VIACOM-610657-v1-Safe_Harbor_Policy.pdf\n\nIf you are located outside of the U.S., the EEA and Switzerland, you use this Site at your own risk and initiative and you, not us, are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and national laws. If this Site is part of the Flux platform, by using this Site, participating in any Site activities, and/or providing us with your Personal Information and Other Information, you (i) consent to the transfer and/or processing of any Information you provide to the Site and to Flux, (ii) acknowledge that U.S. law may provide a lower standard of protection for personal data than the laws of your location and (iii) understand that this Site and Flux will collect, transfer, store, process and/or deal with your Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Flux Privacy Policy and U.S. law.

To sign up for or participate in these features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions. For example, to sign up to receive email newsletters, you may be required to provide your email address, date of birth and zip code separate from any user registration. Further, for example, to the extent we offer such services, if you order any of our various Products (as defined in the Terms of Use Agreement), in addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect and may maintain your billing address, shipping address, Product selections, your credit card or other payment instrument information, your order number and information about your computer's internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (e.g., the referring URL).

Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.\n\n\"Cookies\" (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. \"Web beacons\" (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. The Site and/or third parties may use \"cookies\", \"web beacons\" and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, \"Tracking Technologies\") to collect Other Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.\n\nWe use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between associated sites without logging into each site, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on this Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email messages (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save your password in password-protected areas, save your online game or video player settings, enable you to use shopping carts on the Site, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the Site and for other purposes described in the \"Use of Information\", \"Other Information Collected by Us\" section below. These Tracking Technologies collect \"click stream\" data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site, such as your visits to the Site's webpages, use of our features, and purchasing history or preferences and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the Device you use to access the Site (\"Identifier\").

These Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited. Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.

Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. \n\nSome web browsers may transmit \"do-not-track\" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.\n\nWe currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals. Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for online behavioral advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in Sections 4(b)(i), (ii) and (iii).\n\n5. Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities. \n\nMTV may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from MTV, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates for MTV. The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name. Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.\n\n\n\nWe caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.\n\n\n\nUsers that register for MTV's wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from MTV. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will the Site, MTV, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address. \n\n\n\na.Registration. \nTo the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for MTV's wireless marketing services. Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the \"single opt-in\" or the \"double-opt-in\" (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of MTV depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the \"double opt-in\" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.\n\n\n\ni.Single Opt-in Method:\nIn response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to MTV will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to MTV to send text messages to him or her. MTV will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a \"Thank you\" message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from MTV or by sending a text message to MTV that says \"STOP\", \"END\", \"CANCEL\", \"REMOVE\", \"UNSUBSCRIBE\" or \"QUIT\".\n\n\n\nii.Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:\nIn response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to MTV's sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by MTV) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site's registration page. The user must also agree to the Site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement before the online registration process is completed. MTV will then send a \"Confirmation\" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from MTV to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the \"Confirmation\" message with a text message that states \"YES\" or \"Y\" that will indicate the user's acceptance of MTV's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the \"Confirmation\" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the \"Confirmation\" message at any time provided that MTV may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the \"Confirmation\" is only valid if the response is received while MTV continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.\n\n\n\niii.Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:\nIn response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. MTV will then send a \"Confirmation\" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from MTV to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the \"Confirmation\" message with a text message that states \"YES\" or \"Y\" that will indicate the user's acceptance of MTV's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the \"Confirmation\" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the \"Confirmation\" message at any time provided that MTV may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the \"Confirmation\" is only valid if the response is received while MTV continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Termination of Wireless Services by User. \nRegardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from MTV by the following procedure:\n\n\n\nA user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by MTV at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says \"STOP\", \"END\", \"CANCEL\", \"REMOVE\", \"UNSUBSCRIBE\" or \"QUIT\". MTV will terminate the user's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word \"ALL\" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with MTV. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of MTV service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user's previous opt-in.\n\n\n\nc. Termination of Wireless Services by MTV. \nA user understands, acknowledges and agrees that MTV may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. MTV may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd. Use of Information. \nMTV will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use. We will not share any Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure. We will share Personal Information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with the Parent Companies and Affiliates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information and Other Information.\n\n\n\na.Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information.\n\nGenerally, we do not sell, rent, lease or disclose your Personal Information to third parties, except if you consent to such disclosure or as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n\n\ni.Disclosure to Parent Companies and Affiliates.\nWe may disclose Personal Information to Parent Companies and Affiliates for marketing and/or administrative purposes. You can choose to opt-out of certain such uses as described in the \"Opting-Out of Certain Uses of Personal Information\" Section above.\n\n\n\nii.Disclosure of Certain Information in Postings Intended to Be Disclosed.\nCertain Personal Information associated with a Posting may be intended for disclosure (\"Posting Information\"), such as username. We will disclose Posting Information in connection with the display of, and other services relating to, such Posting.\n\n\n\niii. Disclosure In Connection with Co-Branded Services and Features.\nThe Site may also offer co-branded services and features, such as events and Promotions that we put together with another company or our Parent Companies or Affiliates (\"Co-Branded Partner\") and that may be hosted on the Site and/or our Co-Branded Partner's website. We may share your Personal Information with our Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded service or feature means that you opt-in and give your affirmative consent to both the Site and our Co-Branded Partner to collect the Information provided in connection with the specific co-branded feature or service and to use such Information for the fulfillment of the feature or service and for marketing or administrative purposes. The Co-Branded Partner will be identified on the co-branded feature or service, along with the Co-Branded partner's privacy policy. If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of your Personal Information for marketing purposes, you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly and the use of such information by Co-Branded Partner is subject to Co-Branded Partner's privacy policy.\n\n\n\niv. Disclosure to Operational Service Providers.\nWe also have the right to disclose your Personal Information and Other Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Site's services, features, functions and operations. We will refer to these third parties as \"operational service providers\". We use operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services, features and functions we bring you and we disclose your Information to operational service providers for the purpose of providing services to us.\n\n\n\nv. Disclosure to Certain Other Third Parties. \nIn addition to the above, we will make your Personal Information and Other Information available to certain third parties in the following limited circumstances:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process) or if requested by a governmental agency or other authority as part of an investigation;\n\n\n\n\nIf we believe your actions violate any law, rule, regulation and/or the Terms of Use Agreement, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy, Rules or Additional Terms;\n\n\n\n\nIn connection with Promotions, as necessary to administer the Promotion or as required by applicable laws, rules or regulations (for example, to provide winners' lists or make required filings as appropriate);\n\n\n\n\nIf you opt-in or otherwise agree to have your Personal Information shared with or otherwise disclosed to a third party for marketing purposes, in which case the third party's use of your Information is subject to the third party's own privacy policy;\n\n\n\n\nIf, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate: to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries; to protect our business and assets or the rights, property or safety of the Site, the MTV Channel, the Parent Companies, the Affiliates, or any of its or their operational service providers, licensors, suppliers, Advertisers, customers, users, or any other party; to limit our legal liability; to defend our interests; to enforce this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use Agreement and/or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations or requests by law enforcement agencies or governmental authorities and/or\n\n\n\n\nIn the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, sale, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates.\n\n\n\n\nb.Sharing and Disclosure of Other Information. \nWe may share or otherwise disclose Other Information with third parties, but we do not disclose Personal Information to them except as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.Reviewing, Updating or Deleting Certain Information.\n\nGenerally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Site by clicking \"Account\" on the homepage to sign in to your Site account with your User ID to change, update or deactivate your Personal Information. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information. We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID.\n\n\n\n\nSee Section 9 of the Terms of Use for how registered users of this Site who are California residents and are under 18 years of age may request removal of content or Information in Postings.  \n\n\nYou may also exercise certain privacy settings options by, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site, clicking \"Profile\" or your display name at the top of the Site, selecting \"Edit Profile\" or \"Manage Account\" and selecting the \"Privacy\" tab.\n\n\nCertain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user's request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.\n\n\nIf the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.\n\n\nChildren or Ineligible Teenagers..\nIf we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (\"Ineligible Teenagers\"), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child's (or Ineligible Teenager's) parent or legal guardian (the \"Parent\") always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).\n\n\n\nIn addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the \"Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use\" Section of the Terms of Use Agreement to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's member; alternatively, Parents may send an email to the Site's Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID and request to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information by any person without the user's User ID. If a Parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child's or Ineligible Teenager's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child's or Ineligible Teenager's date of birth. The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. MTV will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. MTV will then terminate the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.\n\n\n\n\n8.Protection of Information.\n\nWhile no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information. However, regardless of our efforts and the Device you use to access the Site, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the Site. We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality.\n\n\nPhishing.\nPhishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity data and financial account credentials. \"Phishers\" use 'spoofed' e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers. WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD! If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site's Privacy Administrator at privacy-admin@mtv.com, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.\n\n\n\n\n9.Your California Privacy Rights.\n\nIf you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options such as your right to opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as \"unsubscribe\") or opt-in for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as Advertisers) for marketing purposes. Therefore, pursuant to the California Civil Code, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.\n\n\nIf you are a California resident and wish to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request by email to the Privacy Administrator at privacy-admin@mtv.com or by postal mail to MTV, mtv.com, 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, Attn: Your California Privacy Rights, c/o Privacy Administrator.\n\n\nAll requests must be labeled \"Your California Privacy Rights\" on the email subject line or envelope or post card.

We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.\n\n\n\n\n10.Changes to this Privacy Policy and Notice.\n\nWe reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by posting an updated Privacy Policy without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective immediately upon posting. Notice of material changes will be posted on the Site's homepage and/or will be provided by e-mailing you or notifying you upon login about these changes; the form of such notice is at our discretion. However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates.\n\n\n\n\n11.Miscellaneous. \n\na.Accuracy and Confidentiality. It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information, including Personal Information, and to keep such information up to date.

We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user's account or any services, features or functions.\n\n\nFurther, if you use any of the Communities features and functions made available on or through the Site, please remember that any Information disclosed in these venues is automatically made public and please use caution when disclosing any Personal Information in the Communities, as you do not know who will access and use your Personal Information or for what purposes.

Users can use the app to watch full episodes and clips of its programming including popular shows such as MTV Teen Mom, My Super Sweet 16, Undressed and many others. Users who have a cable provider account can pretty much watch all available content and those who did not have a limited preview before he ir she is locked out. The app has made sone recent changes with the incorporation of a MTV News section that was formerly another app. While the browsing experience here isn't as smooth as the former standalone app it gets the job done. Overall navigation in the app is better with a simple scroll up and down the main menu page. The app has allows users to set up notifications for their favorite programs adding in a little customization.

For example, if a show aires on cable Thursday, they don’t upload that episode until the following week when a NEW episode aires. Considering I do not have cable, this is highly annoying. More inconveniently, the app NEVER leaves off where I was at in an episode. Not only do I have to remember the EXACT time I left off, but it also doesn’t show the scene when I’m trying to find where I left off. Therefore, I have to literally find where ever I left off. Lastly and more importantly, it is WAY to sensitive to my chrome cast, meaning it disconnects without actually disconnecting to the point I can’t pause the show without completely exiting out of the app, finding the episode I want, and reconnecting to my chrome cast. And it doesn’t even leave off where I was watching after I do this. This happens roughly 3-4 times while watching an episode that I can’t pause it. By the look of the other reviews, this has been an issue for a long time and makes me question how much you people care about what the people who are actually using the app have to say about it.\nAs I’m writing this, I had to pause the episode I’m watching and after only 2 MINUTES of it being paused, I hit play and it started the whole episode ever.

This is how they make money is by the ads, however, there is WAY TOO MANY!! I’ll only watch like 5 mins of an episode and there’s already an ad on! Like are you kidding me?! And the ads each are like 3 mins long. Makes it to where I don’t want to watch the show anymore because of how many ads. It’s ridiculous. Even on tv they don’t show a commercial every 5 mins! Unlike this app watching shows seem almost impossible. A couple times I’d be watching a show on my phone and all of a sudden it will skip WAY ahead even when I’m watching it and I NEVER clicked anything, and then another ad plays and I can’t get out of it. Finally once the ad is over, I go back to where I originally was before it skipped lots of parts, and without a surprise, BOOM, another AD! So annoying. I feel like I can’t enjoy the show without an ad coming in a million times an episode and destroying the purpose of it. And not to mention they’re the SAME ADS EVERYTIME. It gets annoying after awhile. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad if they were different ads. I wish they’d get new ones here and there, but not the same ones each time.

This ruins the anticipation of who will get sent home because you can see it when having to scroll through them all to get to episode 1. I have a big family and rarely get to watch my shows when they happen so this really ruins a lot of what makes this show so great!! I don’t want to know who made it to the Final before I even know who is on this Season!! And the ‘play next’ takes you to the episode before the one you just watch, so then you have to back out and start at the Finale episode and then scroll through them all to get to the episode you need! So every time you want to watch a new episode you have to scroll through the entire season which shows you pictures of people on every episode! So by the time you watch a couple episodes you can tell by the pictures what going to ultimately happen!! And now every episode of every show is locked even with my Dish subscription, and the few that aren’t won’t do anything when clicked on!!

The \"Continue Watching\" feature is never correct where I left off - not even the right episode.  So I have to not only remember where I left off, but to troubleshoot and fast forward I have to sit through ads I might have JUST watched 20 minutes before (cueing up an episode I stopped and want to restart).  The Apple TV app is a bit more efficient during active watching but the iPhone app is awful.  If I'm casting to my TV and do anything else on my phone, when I go back to the app to pause or do anything, the app is back to he home screen with no option to see \"What's Playing\" even AS it is playing on my tv.  So I have to experiment with closing the app, connecting to my cast device, disconnect from cast device, and start ALL over again (find my episode, find my spot, watch ads I've just seen).

Constant error messages, constant loading/playing issues - the shows stop every two or three minutes for anywhere from 15 seconds to three minutes. If you pause and try to slow it to buffer, it makes no difference. The organisation is awful. Episodes are not in order and auto play goes to whatever is listed next. So you may jump from episode 10 to episode 37 and have no idea until you’re so confused you realise you must have missed something. Then to try to look and it takes ten minutes to pause, go back, find the episode you were on, scroll through and find the next episode, press play, wait for it to load if it ever does since have the time it give you an error message that it is having trouble...just a really crappy app all around.
