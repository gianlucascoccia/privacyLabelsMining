I figured a  app designed just for this would be great. I have watched a total of about 1/4 of a race . I used my tv, phone , ipad , macbook, laptop.!!!! NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING!!!!! I can watch all the older races, nothing current . And yes this was before the pandemic. And yes I called support , rude and very unhelpful, I requested a cancellation and a refund.,! Same as the app Nothing Nothing Nothing😭</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>This is a disappointing upgrade from All Access. We are supposed to be able to watch video on demand. Most is non existent. They keep removing what I’m currently watching. The seasons events should be on in the correct chronological order. They are not. I log in to watch a race on demand and the icon for the race has the resulting winner listed... spoiler... video freezes. Video has technical difficulties. Audio is missing. Very poor quality. I don’t mind the big price if it is good. It’s not. I’ve submitted numerous trouble tickets. They just mark them as solved. Boo!</p>

ROD ASSOCIATION PRIVACY POLICY\nEffective Date: January 25, 2019\n\nThe National Hot Rod Association (”NHRA” or ”we”, ”our”, or ”us”) knows that safeguarding your privacy is important. This policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the kinds of information we gather from you, how this information is used and protected, and how you can control its use. This Privacy Policy covers the privacy practices of NHRA with respect to information collected through both: (1) our online services which includes our web sites, e.g., www.NHRA.com and www.NHRA.tv (each a “Website”) and any applications published or operated by NHRA that are accessed through your mobile, tablet computer or other similar device (each a “Mobile App”), and also any widgets, applications, television applications or channels, interactive features and/or downloads that are owned or operated by NHRA and available through these Websites, Mobile Apps, or other devices or that post a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, with our Websites and Mobile Apps, our “Online Services”); and (2) our “offline” activities – such as collection of data by telephone, in-person (such as at NHRA events), by mail, paper documents or other such offline means operated, provided or made available by NHRA.\n\nBy accessing or using our Online Services, or otherwise giving us your information, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy and expressly consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information according to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to our policies and practices, do not access our Websites, or download, install or use our Mobile Apps, or give us any of your information.\n\nAs we update and expand our Online Services, this Privacy Policy may change. So please review it from time to time.\n\n\n1. Information We Collect\n\n(a) Information You Provide. If you create an account for our Online Services, become an NHRA member, or register to participate in a race, you may provide us information such as your name, mailing address, telephone number (including mobile), fax number and email address, and we will request that you create a username and password. Additionally, to participate in a race, you will be asked to provide your Social Security number, driver’s license number or other government issued ID number, and birth date. If you make purchases through our online stores, you will be asked to provide shipping and payment information. If you contact us with questions or to request information, you may provide us with additional personal information so that we can respond to your requests. From time to time, we may request information from you regarding your membership or race activities, or generally via surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other means. Participation in these activities is voluntary; you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We may also collect demographic information about you, such as gender, age range, occupation, or other such category information that does not identify or locate you personally (“Demographic Information”). We do not consider Demographic Information about you to be personal information unless it is associated with personal information so as to permit identification of you. If we combine Demographic Information with the personal information we collect, we will treat it as personal information under this Privacy Policy.\n\nYou may choose not to provide NHRA with any contact information; however, in that case, we will be unable to respond to your request for NHRA information, process your order for products, tickets or other services, sign you up for NHRA membership or race registration, or allow you to participate in other Online Services that require personal information.\n\n(b) Information We Collect Via Technology. In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of methods or technologies that automatically or passively collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Online Services (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information may include the browser you are using, the URL that referred you to our Online Services, all of the areas within our Online Services that you visit, your video viewing history, and the time of day, among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Online Services and your interaction with them. In addition, we collect unique identifiers (“Device Identifier”) for your computer or other devices used to access the Online Services (any, a “Device”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Services, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. When you visit our Online Services, we collect some general information about your computing Device, including its IP address, the operating system it uses (for example, Windows XP), the browser software it uses (for example, Microsoft Internet Explorer), and your Internet service provider (for example, AT\u0026T). This information helps us better understand the people who visit our Online Services. We collect this general information to identify the most popular areas on our Online Services and to provide aggregate information to our advertisers to let them know about the number of people who have seen and clicked on a few of the methods and technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include the following:\n\nCookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to access the Online Services. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plugin that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and Flash cookies are standard in the industry; you’ll find them at most major websites. Cookies and Flash cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Online Services may not function properly.\n\nWeb Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web and mobile pages and email messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Online Services, to monitor how users navigate the Online Services, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.\n\nEmbedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Online Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Online Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.\n\n(c) Information From Other Sources. We may from time to time supplement the information we collect about you with information from other sources, including but not limited to, third-party verification services, credit bureaus, mailing list providers, other service providers and publicly available sources. This may be done for various purposes, such as to obtain information validating your address or information you provided to us, including, without limitation, in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. Thus, information we obtain may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through other sources, including both offline and online sources. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal information received, unless we have stated otherwise.\n\n(d) Social Media Information. You may also choose to participate in a third party application (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application on a third party web site) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information. The third party may allow you to remove the application, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “friends” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your friend’s web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.\nSome of our Online Services may include social media plug-ins and features (such as the Facebook “Like” button) and widgets (such as the “Share This” button) or interactive mini-programs that run on our Online Services. In addition, some of our Online Services may also permit or require you to register or log into your account via a social networking platform such as Login with Facebook.\n\nThese social media features and plug-ins may share with us your username and password for the social media services and other information available about you or collected from you on these social media services, in accordance with the terms and conditions (e.g., terms of use and privacy policy) of the company providing them. In addition, the companies providing these features and plug-ins may be able to collect information about you, including your IP address, your activity on our Online Services, and they may notify your connections on the social networking platform about your use of our Online Services. These social media services may also set a cookie to enable a feature to function properly, and employ unique identifiers which allow your activity to be monitored across multiple websites and mobile applications for purposes of delivering more targeted advertising to you.\n\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by either a third-party or hosted directly on our Online Services. Your interactions with these plugs-in and features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.\n\n(e) Information You Provide About a Third Party. If you send someone else a communication from or through our Online Services, such as sending an article to a friend or information about our events or products, we use the information you provide (typically, names and email addresses) to facilitate the communication and we do not use it for any other marketing purpose, unless we obtain consent from that person.\n\n(f) Information Collected by Mobile Apps. We may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to, technical information about your Device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to any Mobile Apps.\n\nIf we implement one or more Mobile Apps, the Mobile App may automatically collect and store some or all of the following information from your mobile Device (“Mobile Device Information”), including without limitation:\n\nYour preferred language and country site (if applicable)\nYour phone number or other unique Device identifier assigned to your mobile Device\nThe mobile Device manufacturer and model of your mobile Device\nThe IP address of your mobile device\nYour mobile operating system\nThe type of mobile Internet browsers you are using\nInformation about how you interact with the Mobile App and any of our Website to which the Mobile App links, such as how many times you use a specific part of the Mobile App over a given time period, the amount of time you spend using the Mobile App, how often you use the Mobile App, actions you take in the Mobile App and how you engage with the Mobile App\nInformation to allow us to personalize the services and content available through the Mobile App\nYour geolocation\nWe may associate your unique Device Identifier or Mobile App Usage Information with any personal information you provide.\n\n\n2. How We Use the Information We Collect \n\nWe may use the personal information we collect about you for various purposes including to : (i) provide products, information, or services, or to process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive, such as racer registration, other racer services, membership and subscription services, fulfill a purchase for merchandise or tickets, or to send you electronic newsletters or other publications; (ii) sell and promote NHRA events, tickets and merchandise, and processing transactions for them, (iii) operate, maintain and improve our Online Services; (iv) conduct marketing and research analysis, and product service and development; (v) advertise, market and promote products and services we feel may be of interest to you; (vi) process entries for sweepstakes, contests or other promotions, and deliver rewards or prizes; (vii) engage in record-keeping; (vii) respond to comments and questions from users; (ix) improve the Online Services and to customize your experience on the Online Services to individual visitors, or to serve you specific content that is most relevant to you; (x) enable you to participate in a variety of the Online Services’ features, such as online entry and registration forms, and interactive features; (xi) process your registration with the Online Services, including verifying your email address is active and valid; (xii) to contact you with regard to your use of our Online Services or offline activities, or tickets, events, products, promotions, surveys, or new developments or events, and in our discretion, changes to the Online Services and/or the Online Services’ policies; (xiii) perform internal business purposes; (xiv) develop an individual profile or a profile of certain groups of visitors to or users of our Online Services or; (xv) to prevent, discover and investigate fraud, violations of this Privacy Policy or any applicable terms of use, terms of service, or Mobile App end user license agreement; (xvi) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.\n\nIf you do not want to be contacted about our new, products, events, and promotions, you can let us know at any time.

We will delete information after that time except where we need to keep any information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.\n\n\n3. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties \n\nNHRA may share Usage Information and Demographic Information with third parties for their use. In addition, NHRA may share personal information we have collected about you as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy.\n\n(a) For Third-Party Marketing Purposes. NHRA may disclose yourpersonal information to advertisers, marketers, sponsors, business partners and other third parties for their use (including for them to directly market to you). The types of businesses in which such third parties are engaged include but are not limited to the following: NHRA sponsors; magazine publishing and retailing; market analysis and development; participatory databases; non-profit organizations; and advertisers. If you do not want us to share with third parties your personal information for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, please advise us by emailing us at nothirdparties@nhra.com or writing to us at the address provided in Section 13 below. Please include “Third-Party Marketing Opt-Out” in the subject line of your email or letter.\n\n(b) Third Parties Providing Services. We may use third party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of the Online Services, such as hosting the Online Services, providing video streaming platforms, designing and/or operating the Online Services’ features, tracking analytics, enabling you to purchase tickets and products, and enabling NHRA to send you email newsletters or performing other administrative services. We may provide these companies with access to user information, including personal information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for NHRA. (For example, online purchases require us to disclose necessary payment information to payment processors. We also may use third parties to send you products or tickets that you purchase, in which case we would provide them with your name, address, and other information to complete your order.) We do not authorize these vendors to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.\n\nSome third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons and embedded scripts on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information. When using the Online Services, certain third parties may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites. This Privacy Policy does not govern such third party tracking technologies but does govern our collection and use of your Usage Information we receive in connection therewith.\n\n(c) Co-branded Areas. Certain areas of the Online Services may be provided to you in association with third parties (“Co-Branded Areas”) and may require you to disclose personal information in order to register for and access products or services. Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party associates. If you elect to register for products and/or services at Co-Branded Areas you may be providing your information to both NHRA and the third party associates. Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Area with a username and password obtained on the Online Services, your personal information may be disclosed to the identified third party associates for that Co-Branded Area and will be subject to the posted privacy policies of the relevant third party associates.\n\n(d) Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions. We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a “Promotion”) through the Online Services that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the terms, conditions and official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, personal information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion’s official rules, such as on a winners list.\n\n(e) Administrative and Legal Reasons. We may transfer and disclose your information, including personal information, to third parties: (i) in the event we are required to respond to subpoenas or other legal process or if in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iii) to protect and/or defend the Online Services’ Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the Online Services; (iv) to protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any individual; or (v) to prevent financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity. We may also use IP address or other Device Identifiers to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies in our discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.\n\n(f) Business Transfer. NHRA may share personal information with its parent and its and their subsidiaries and affiliates. NHRA also reserves the right to disclose and transfer all information related to the Online Services, including, without limitation, your personal information, Demographic Information and Usage Information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Online Services or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a corporate merger, change of control, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of NHRA’s assets or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.\n\n\n4. Online Behavioral Advertising and How Can You Opt-Out\n\nWe may work with third-party advertising companies who may utilize cookies and web beacons, and data collected on our Online Services, to customize advertisements to you on our Online Services, as well as on other websites or mobile applications in their networks beyond our Online Services. Among other things, these customized advertisements may advertise our products and services on websites or mobile applications not affiliated with us. Some of these ads are online behavioral advertising – which serve advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you using non-personal behavioral information. Such ads may contain cookies that allow monitoring of websites and mobile applications (including our own Online Services) and your response to our advertisements. Third-party advertising companies may track your usage across our Online Services and other website or mobile applications in their networks. We limit companies that place our ads from using information for any purpose other than to assist us in our advertising efforts.\n\nFor more information about these third-party advertising companies’ privacy policies, visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s website at http://www.networkadvertising.org. If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt-out of network advertising programs that use your information. To do so, please visit: the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page.\n\nPlease note that if you opt out, you will still see advertisements while you are browsing online. However, the advertisements you see will not be based on your preferences or behavior, and thus may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.\n\nIn order for behavioral advertising opt-outs to work on your Device, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new Device, access our Online Services from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser’s security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.\n\nHow We Respond to “Do Not Track” Signals (for California Residents)\nAt this time, our Online Services do not honor or take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals from browsers because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We may adopt a standard once one is created.\n\n\n5. Reviewing, Editing or Deleting Your Personal Information\n\nYou can review, edit or delete personal information you have submitted through our Online Services. (We do not have a mechanism for you to review, edit or delete information we have collected about you through offline activities).\n\nTo review personal information you submitted to us through Online Services, we need to verify your identity, so send us a written request by mail to NATIONAL HOT ROD ASSOCIATION, Privacy Policy, 2035 Financial Way, Glendora, CA 91741, asking us to provide a complete copy of the personal information you have submitted to us through Online Services. Tell us whether you want to receive the information by email and if so include your email address, or by regular mail and if so include you mailing address. You may email your request to digital@nhra.com.\n\nTo edit or delete any information submitted to us through Online Services, just e-mail us at remove@nhra.com and advise us that you wish us to delete all or a specified portion of your information. Please be sure to give us your name and email address. NHRA will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. If you request deletion of your personal information, we will make good faith efforts to delete or destroy any personal information that we have collected about you through Online Services, solely to the extent permitted by law. When we delete electronic information that we have collected from or about you, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives; for example; there may be residual information that will remain in our archive databases, access logs and other records, which may or may not contain your personal information. Moreover, we may retain personal information for the administrative and legal reasons described in Section 3(e).\n\n\n6. Changing Permissions\n\n(a) Opt Out of Receiving Marketing Emails from NHRA. When you receive promotional emails from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving such communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link provided at the bottom of an email sent to you by NHRA or by following any other instructions in the applicable email.\n\nHowever, we may contact you for transactional, administrative and service-related purposes (e.g., in connection with a purchase, for a customer service response, or to notify you of changes to the Online Services or the Privacy Policy) when we believe it necessary or advisable to do so. You may not opt out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to terminate any account you have with NHRA and to stop using the Online Services (or to ask that we delete all your personal information, using the procedure in Section 5 above). You understand that any such termination of your account may involve deletion of your personal information from our live databases. NHRA will not have any liability to you for any termination of your account or related deletion of your information.\n\n(b) Opt Out of Having NHRA Share Your Personal Information to Third Parties for Direct Marketing Purposes. As explained in Section 3 above, if you do not want us to share with third parties your personal information for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, please advise us by emailing us at nothirdparties@nhra.com or writing to us at the mailing address provided in Section 13 below.\n\n(c) Revoke NHRA Permission to Use Your Personal Information. To revoke the permission you have given us to use or disclose any personal information about you, just e-mail us at our web site at remove@nhra.com.\n\n\n7. Security\n\nWe have implemented measures designed to protect and secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet, wireless transmission or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use our Online Services and provide us with your information at your risk.\n\nThe safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where you have chosen a password for any user account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We expect you to not share your password with anyone.\n\n\n8. Links to Other Sites\n\nWhen you use the Online Services, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. For example, if you “click” on a banner advertisement, or a link, the “click” takes your browser off our Online Services. These other sites may have information practices that are different from ours. We have no control over, do not review and are not responsible for the privacy policies of such other websites or other locations. You should consult the other sites’ privacy notices because we have no control over these third party sites including what information is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties and how it is used. For example, these other sites and locations may send their own cookies or other tracking technologies to users, collect user data, or solicit personal information.\n\nIn addition, our Online Services may offer services or contain content (e.g., video streaming services, racer registration and other racer matters, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, surveys or other items) that are supplied or hosted by a third-party and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier. For example, this may occur with service or content sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. Through these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in that activity. NHRA has no control over these third parties’ privacy practices, including what information is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties and how it is used, so we encourage you to read their privacy policy before providing information to them.\n\nIn addition, we may contract with third parties to provide services such as online order selection and fulfillment services for the products, tickets, and other services available through our Online Services. Such third parties’ websites or mobile applications are subject to their policies, and when you are on those websites or mobile applications, those third parties’ privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy govern the collection of information from you.\n\n\n9. Transfer of Information to the United States\n\nThe Online Services are operated in the United States and intended for users located in the United States. If you are located anywhere else outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to and processed in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. By using the Online Services or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States.\n\n\n10. Your California Privacy Rights\n\nCalifornia’s “Shine the Light” law, California Civil Code § 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers (those who have an established business relationship with us) asking about the business’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We comply with this law in both ways.\n\nFirst, you may request the following information, which will be provided to you via either a writing or e-mail free or charge: (1) a list of the categories of personal information disclosed by us for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year; and (2) the name and addresses of all third parties that received personal information from us for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year and, if the nature of the third parties’ business cannot reasonably be determined from the third parties’ name, examples of the products or services marketed, if known to us, sufficient to give you a reasonable indication of the nature of the third parties’ business. Requests for this information should be sent to the contact information set forth in Section 13 below.\n\nAlternatively, as discussed above in Section 3, if you wish to opt-out of having your personal information shared with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, please contact us, by email or letter, using the contact information set forth in Section 13 below.\n\n\n11. Changes to this Privacy Policy \n\nFrom time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy.

Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web and mobile pages and email messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Online Services, to monitor how users navigate the Online Services, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.\n\nEmbedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Online Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Online Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.\n\n(c) Information From Other Sources. We may from time to time supplement the information we collect about you with information from other sources, including but not limited to, third-party verification services, credit bureaus, mailing list providers, other service providers and publicly available sources. This may be done for various purposes, such as to obtain information validating your address or information you provided to us, including, without limitation, in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. Thus, information we obtain may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through other sources, including both offline and online sources. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal information received, unless we have stated otherwise.\n\n(d) Social Media Information. You may also choose to participate in a third party application (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application on a third party web site) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information. The third party may allow you to remove the application, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “friends” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your friend’s web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.\nSome of our Online Services may include social media plug-ins and features (such as the Facebook “Like” button) and widgets (such as the “Share This” button) or interactive mini-programs that run on our Online Services. In addition, some of our Online Services may also permit or require you to register or log into your account via a social networking platform such as Login with Facebook.\n\nThese social media features and plug-ins may share with us your username and password for the social media services and other information available about you or collected from you on these social media services, in accordance with the terms and conditions (e.g., terms of use and privacy policy) of the company providing them. In addition, the companies providing these features and plug-ins may be able to collect information about you, including your IP address, your activity on our Online Services, and they may notify your connections on the social networking platform about your use of our Online Services. These social media services may also set a cookie to enable a feature to function properly, and employ unique identifiers which allow your activity to be monitored across multiple websites and mobile applications for purposes of delivering more targeted advertising to you.\n\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by either a third-party or hosted directly on our Online Services. Your interactions with these plugs-in and features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.\n\n(e) Information You Provide About a Third Party. If you send someone else a communication from or through our Online Services, such as sending an article to a friend or information about our events or products, we use the information you provide (typically, names and email addresses) to facilitate the communication and we do not use it for any other marketing purpose, unless we obtain consent from that person.\n\n(f) Information Collected by Mobile Apps. We may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to, technical information about your Device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to any Mobile Apps.\n\nIf we implement one or more Mobile Apps, the Mobile App may automatically collect and store some or all of the following information from your mobile Device (“Mobile Device Information”), including without limitation:\n\nYour preferred language and country site (if applicable)\nYour phone number or other unique Device identifier assigned to your mobile Device\nThe mobile Device manufacturer and model of your mobile Device\nThe IP address of your mobile device\nYour mobile operating system\nThe type of mobile Internet browsers you are using\nInformation about how you interact with the Mobile App and any of our Website to which the Mobile App links, such as how many times you use a specific part of the Mobile App over a given time period, the amount of time you spend using the Mobile App, how often you use the Mobile App, actions you take in the Mobile App and how you engage with the Mobile App\nInformation to allow us to personalize the services and content available through the Mobile App\nYour geolocation\nWe may associate your unique Device Identifier or Mobile App Usage Information with any personal information you provide.\n\n\n2. How We Use the Information We Collect \n\nWe may use the personal information we collect about you for various purposes including to : (i) provide products, information, or services, or to process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive, such as racer registration, other racer services, membership and subscription services, fulfill a purchase for merchandise or tickets, or to send you electronic newsletters or other publications; (ii) sell and promote NHRA events, tickets and merchandise, and processing transactions for them, (iii) operate, maintain and improve our Online Services; (iv) conduct marketing and research analysis, and product service and development; (v) advertise, market and promote products and services we feel may be of interest to you; (vi) process entries for sweepstakes, contests or other promotions, and deliver rewards or prizes; (vii) engage in record-keeping; (vii) respond to comments and questions from users; (ix) improve the Online Services and to customize your experience on the Online Services to individual visitors, or to serve you specific content that is most relevant to you; (x) enable you to participate in a variety of the Online Services’ features, such as online entry and registration forms, and interactive features; (xi) process your registration with the Online Services, including verifying your email address is active and valid; (xii) to contact you with regard to your use of our Online Services or offline activities, or tickets, events, products, promotions, surveys, or new developments or events, and in our discretion, changes to the Online Services and/or the Online Services’ policies; (xiii) perform internal business purposes; (xiv) develop an individual profile or a profile of certain groups of visitors to or users of our Online Services or; (xv) to prevent, discover and investigate fraud, violations of this Privacy Policy or any applicable terms of use, terms of service, or Mobile App end user license agreement; (xvi) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.\n\nIf you do not want to be contacted about our new, products, events, and promotions, you can let us know at any time. See Section 5 below “Reviewing, Editing or Deleting Your Personal Information.” However, opting out of receiving information electronically from NHRA may reduce your level of service from NHRA.\n\nWe retain information, including personal information, for as long as we need to use it for the reasons set forth above. We will delete information after that time except where we need to keep any information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.\n\n\n3. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties \n\nNHRA may share Usage Information and Demographic Information with third parties for their use. In addition, NHRA may share personal information we have collected about you as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy.\n\n(a) For Third-Party Marketing Purposes. NHRA may disclose yourpersonal information to advertisers, marketers, sponsors, business partners and other third parties for their use (including for them to directly market to you). The types of businesses in which such third parties are engaged include but are not limited to the following: NHRA sponsors; magazine publishing and retailing; market analysis and development; participatory databases; non-profit organizations; and advertisers. If you do not want us to share with third parties your personal information for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, please advise us by emailing us at nothirdparties@nhra.com or writing to us at the address provided in Section 13 below. Please include “Third-Party Marketing Opt-Out” in the subject line of your email or letter.\n\n(b) Third Parties Providing Services. We may use third party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of the Online Services, such as hosting the Online Services, providing video streaming platforms, designing and/or operating the Online Services’ features, tracking analytics, enabling you to purchase tickets and products, and enabling NHRA to send you email newsletters or performing other administrative services. We may provide these companies with access to user information, including personal information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for NHRA. (For example, online purchases require us to disclose necessary payment information to payment processors. We also may use third parties to send you products or tickets that you purchase, in which case we would provide them with your name, address, and other information to complete your order.) We do not authorize these vendors to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.\n\nSome third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons and embedded scripts on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information. When using the Online Services, certain third parties may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites. This Privacy Policy does not govern such third party tracking technologies but does govern our collection and use of your Usage Information we receive in connection therewith.\n\n(c) Co-branded Areas. Certain areas of the Online Services may be provided to you in association with third parties (“Co-Branded Areas”) and may require you to disclose personal information in order to register for and access products or services. Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party associates. If you elect to register for products and/or services at Co-Branded Areas you may be providing your information to both NHRA and the third party associates. Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Area with a username and password obtained on the Online Services, your personal information may be disclosed to the identified third party associates for that Co-Branded Area and will be subject to the posted privacy policies of the relevant third party associates.\n\n(d) Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions. We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a “Promotion”) through the Online Services that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the terms, conditions and official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, personal information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion’s official rules, such as on a winners list.\n\n(e) Administrative and Legal Reasons. We may transfer and disclose your information, including personal information, to third parties: (i) in the event we are required to respond to subpoenas or other legal process or if in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iii) to protect and/or defend the Online Services’ Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the Online Services; (iv) to protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any individual; or (v) to prevent financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity. We may also use IP address or other Device Identifiers to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies in our discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.\n\n(f) Business Transfer. NHRA may share personal information with its parent and its and their subsidiaries and affiliates. NHRA also reserves the right to disclose and transfer all information related to the Online Services, including, without limitation, your personal information, Demographic Information and Usage Information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Online Services or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a corporate merger, change of control, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of NHRA’s assets or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.\n\n\n4. Online Behavioral Advertising and How Can You Opt-Out\n\nWe may work with third-party advertising companies who may utilize cookies and web beacons, and data collected on our Online Services, to customize advertisements to you on our Online Services, as well as on other websites or mobile applications in their networks beyond our Online Services. Among other things, these customized advertisements may advertise our products and services on websites or mobile applications not affiliated with us. Some of these ads are online behavioral advertising – which serve advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you using non-personal behavioral information. Such ads may contain cookies that allow monitoring of websites and mobile applications (including our own Online Services) and your response to our advertisements. Third-party advertising companies may track your usage across our Online Services and other website or mobile applications in their networks. We limit companies that place our ads from using information for any purpose other than to assist us in our advertising efforts.\n\nFor more information about these third-party advertising companies’ privacy policies, visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s website at http://www.networkadvertising.org. If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt-out of network advertising programs that use your information. To do so, please visit: the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page.\n\nPlease note that if you opt out, you will still see advertisements while you are browsing online. However, the advertisements you see will not be based on your preferences or behavior, and thus may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.\n\nIn order for behavioral advertising opt-outs to work on your Device, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new Device, access our Online Services from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser’s security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.\n\nHow We Respond to “Do Not Track” Signals (for California Residents)\nAt this time, our Online Services do not honor or take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals from browsers because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We may adopt a standard once one is created.\n\n\n5. Reviewing, Editing or Deleting Your Personal Information\n\nYou can review, edit or delete personal information you have submitted through our Online Services. (We do not have a mechanism for you to review, edit or delete information we have collected about you through offline activities).\n\nTo review personal information you submitted to us through Online Services, we need to verify your identity, so send us a written request by mail to NATIONAL HOT ROD ASSOCIATION, Privacy Policy, 2035 Financial Way, Glendora, CA 91741, asking us to provide a complete copy of the personal information you have submitted to us through Online Services. Tell us whether you want to receive the information by email and if so include your email address, or by regular mail and if so include you mailing address. You may email your request to digital@nhra.com.\n\nTo edit or delete any information submitted to us through Online Services, just e-mail us at remove@nhra.com and advise us that you wish us to delete all or a specified portion of your information. Please be sure to give us your name and email address. NHRA will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. If you request deletion of your personal information, we will make good faith efforts to delete or destroy any personal information that we have collected about you through Online Services, solely to the extent permitted by law. When we delete electronic information that we have collected from or about you, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives; for example; there may be residual information that will remain in our archive databases, access logs and other records, which may or may not contain your personal information. Moreover, we may retain personal information for the administrative and legal reasons described in Section 3(e).\n\n\n6. Changing Permissions\n\n(a) Opt Out of Receiving Marketing Emails from NHRA. When you receive promotional emails from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving such communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link provided at the bottom of an email sent to you by NHRA or by following any other instructions in the applicable email.\n\nHowever, we may contact you for transactional, administrative and service-related purposes (e.g., in connection with a purchase, for a customer service response, or to notify you of changes to the Online Services or the Privacy Policy) when we believe it necessary or advisable to do so. You may not opt out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to terminate any account you have with NHRA and to stop using the Online Services (or to ask that we delete all your personal information, using the procedure in Section 5 above). You understand that any such termination of your account may involve deletion of your personal information from our live databases. NHRA will not have any liability to you for any termination of your account or related deletion of your information.\n\n(b) Opt Out of Having NHRA Share Your Personal Information to Third Parties for Direct Marketing Purposes. As explained in Section 3 above, if you do not want us to share with third parties your personal information for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, please advise us by emailing us at nothirdparties@nhra.com or writing to us at the mailing address provided in Section 13 below.\n\n(c) Revoke NHRA Permission to Use Your Personal Information. To revoke the permission you have given us to use or disclose any personal information about you, just e-mail us at our web site at remove@nhra.com.\n\n\n7. Security\n\nWe have implemented measures designed to protect and secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet, wireless transmission or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use our Online Services and provide us with your information at your risk.\n\nThe safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where you have chosen a password for any user account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We expect you to not share your password with anyone.\n\n\n8. Links to Other Sites\n\nWhen you use the Online Services, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. For example, if you “click” on a banner advertisement, or a link, the “click” takes your browser off our Online Services. These other sites may have information practices that are different from ours. We have no control over, do not review and are not responsible for the privacy policies of such other websites or other locations. You should consult the other sites’ privacy notices because we have no control over these third party sites including what information is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties and how it is used. For example, these other sites and locations may send their own cookies or other tracking technologies to users, collect user data, or solicit personal information.\n\nIn addition, our Online Services may offer services or contain content (e.g., video streaming services, racer registration and other racer matters, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, surveys or other items) that are supplied or hosted by a third-party and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier. For example, this may occur with service or content sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. Through these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in that activity. NHRA has no control over these third parties’ privacy practices, including what information is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties and how it is used, so we encourage you to read their privacy policy before providing information to them.\n\nIn addition, we may contract with third parties to provide services such as online order selection and fulfillment services for the products, tickets, and other services available through our Online Services. Such third parties’ websites or mobile applications are subject to their policies, and when you are on those websites or mobile applications, those third parties’ privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy govern the collection of information from you.\n\n\n9. Transfer of Information to the United States\n\nThe Online Services are operated in the United States and intended for users located in the United States. If you are located anywhere else outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to and processed in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. By using the Online Services or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States.\n\n\n10. Your California Privacy Rights\n\nCalifornia’s “Shine the Light” law, California Civil Code § 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers (those who have an established business relationship with us) asking about the business’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We comply with this law in both ways.\n\nFirst, you may request the following information, which will be provided to you via either a writing or e-mail free or charge: (1) a list of the categories of personal information disclosed by us for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year; and (2) the name and addresses of all third parties that received personal information from us for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year and, if the nature of the third parties’ business cannot reasonably be determined from the third parties’ name, examples of the products or services marketed, if known to us, sufficient to give you a reasonable indication of the nature of the third parties’ business. Requests for this information should be sent to the contact information set forth in Section 13 below.\n\nAlternatively, as discussed above in Section 3, if you wish to opt-out of having your personal information shared with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, please contact us, by email or letter, using the contact information set forth in Section 13 below.\n\n\n11. Changes to this Privacy Policy \n\nFrom time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. You agree that we may notify you about material changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a notice of such updates on the Site. You should check the Site frequently for updates.\n\n\n12. Children Under 13\n\nUnless specifically stated on a Website or Mobile App (such as in a posted Children’s Privacy Policy), our Websites and Mobile Apps are general audience services and are not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, do not provide personal information to NHRA through our Websites and Mobile Apps. If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information through any of our Websites or Mobile Apps and we do not have parental consent, we promptly delete that child’s information from the Website or Mobile App. If you believe that NHRA has been provided (through one of our Websites or Mobile Apps) the personal information of a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, please notify us immediately using the contact information in Section 13 below.\n\n\n13. Contact Us \n\nIf you wish to contact us or have any questions about this Privacy Policy or about how personal information is used, you can contact us by e-mail at digital@nhra.com, or by regular U.S. mail to:\n\nNATIONAL HOT ROD ASSOCIATION\nATTN: Privacy Policy\n2035 Financial Way\nGlendora, CA 91741\n\nIf you are opting out of having your personal information shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please include “Third-Party Marketing Opt-Out” in the subject line of your email or letter.","is32bitOnly":false,"isStandaloneWithCompanionForWatchOS":false,"seller":"National Hot Rod Association","isSiriSupported":false,"languageList":["English"],"messagesScreenshots":{},"description":{"standard":"Stream all 24 NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series events.
