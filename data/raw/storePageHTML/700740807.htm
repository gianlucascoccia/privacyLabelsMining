With over 20,000 sellers in our network and over 6 million cars to shop, if you can’t find it on the Autotrader app, it might not exist. Be confident the price is fair with Kelley Blue Book® Price Advisor on every Autotrader listing. The Autotrader app is your solution for finding the right car or dealer, no matter where you are. \r\n\r\nPersonalization\r\nWe’ll help personalize your car shopping experience. Pick up where you left off or get recommendations based on features you care about. You can even sign up for alerts on price drops and get notified when new listings that match your search criteria are added.  \r\n\r\nOur unique filters stand out from the rest. Want to shop for cars from the comfort of your home? Try the Delivery to Your Door filter. These vehicles can be shipped to your front door and you’ll never have to visit the dealership. If you’re looking for a specific interior color, we have that too. We understand that the exterior color is not the only color that matters. You can filter down to specific technology, safety and exterior features like roof racks. Be as specific as you need and let our filters do the work.\r\n\r\nShop All the Cars\r\nWith our huge network of sellers and cars, we make it easy to compare and track the cars you like, plus get vehicle info and condition reports (when available) along the way.

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I have been using Autotrader for years.  The last few times I have used it not only is it glitchy and freeze up, but the quality of the results were not inclusive of many many other results found on other competing websites.  Step it up or I will start my car searches where the results can be found.  I have also sold a few cars on Autotrader.  The last time I TRIED to sell a car I was SHOCKED how expensive it was.  Tried it for a few weeks with only a few calls, all tire kickers.  I put the same car on another site after a few weeks on Autotrader and we had ten calls in two days and the car was sold within a week.  So, again poor results.  Autotrader needs to lower the cost to list a car to solve their two biggest problems.  1)Not enough listings 2)because it’s to expensive to list a vehicle.  Look, I think Autotrader has been the goto in car searches/selling over the years, but they got too big for their britches!  Come back to reality Autotrader and realize you are getting your clocks cleaned cause you got greedy.......</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love this app. I browse it weekly, sometimes daily! I wrote a review a while ago suggesting they make an option to sort vehicles by uploaded date so we can see the newly listed ones as a filter so we don’t keep looking at all the same ones we don’t want. It finally happened! So I just want to thank you whoever updates this app and say it’s amazing now!! I love it even more! Keep up the great work. Also maybe have the private seller ones show us at least a state that it’s located in so we know if we want to even bother with it! That would be cool. And one more idea: can we please have an option to get rid of a vehicle in our saved searches that doesn’t meet our needs so we don’t have to keep checking it again and again? Meaning: let’s say I search for a Fiat and I put in specific criteria and save it. Ok so now I check that saved search every day and if I find a vehicle that I definitely don’t want to look at again within my search I would like to have the option to get rid of it within that saved search. Thanks!!! . :-)</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>For the most part I love Autotrader.  I find it very useful.  I found my most recent vehicle purchase on it.  But you guys really need to hammer out the glitches in your app.  If I get particularly far in scrolling through a search the app just decides it can’t handle it and shuts down.  Then I have to restart my search from the beginning and try to scroll back to where I left off.  I think to myself “maybe I should check to see if there’s an update that fixes this.”   Yes!  An update there is.  Great, let’s try this out again.  Problem definitely “fixed.”   It’s not crashing out of the searches any more because it will only let me see....oh, I dunno....50 of the results?   Out of 1600.  Yeah that’s just perfect.  That’s exactly what I was hoping for.  Just show me those 50 cars.  And let’s forget all about the other 1550 I might be interested in.  God forbid you let me see them, because obviously your app can’t handle it without crashing.  I’m rolling my eyes so hard that if I was driving, I would crash like your app.  Or, I just update my brain to the new software version that only lets me see 5 cars on the road at a time, and then I would never crash.  Because that’s how things work, right?</p>

Various technologies are used to automatically collect information, such as cookies, local shared objects, and web beacons (generally referred to as \"Data Technologies\". \"Cookies\" are small identifiers sent from a web server that are stored on your device for the purpose of identifying your browser or storing information or settings in your browser. \"Local shared objects,\" sometimes known as Flash cookies, may be used to store your preferences or display content based upon what you have viewed on various websites to personalize your visit. A \"web beacon,\" also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies. Anonymous advertising identifiers are increasingly being used on mobile devices and otherwise in a manner similar to cookies. When we refer to Data Technologies, we are including all current and similar future technologies.\nOne or more Data Technologies may be used on the Autotrader Sites and other websites and mobile applications (that may not be the Autotrader Sites) by us, by another party on our behalf, or by third parties in accordance with their privacy policies. Data Technologies may be used by us and others, on our behalf and on their own behalf, to transmit information to you or about you and connect information about you from different sources, websites, devices, and mobile applications.\n\nWe may use a uniquely generated trackable toll-free telephone number on dealer sites or in advertisements. If you call one of these uniquely generated toll-free numbers, we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) may collect non-personally identifiable information about the call (e.g. date, time, duration), as well as personally identifiable information (e.g. your name, the number from which your call originated).\n\nVideos. We may target and track the videos you view on the Sites. You consent to our tracking of your video viewing through the Site or third party social media for up to two years or as permitted by applicable law.\n \nLocation Information. When you download or use ths Autotrader Sites, we may collect physical location information that is sufficiently precise to allow us to locate a specific person or device (\"Location Information\"). We also may collect Location Information when you visit or are in the vicinity of one of our dealers. We only collect Location Information with your permission (e.g., such as when you agree to provide it to us after you initially access or download the Autotrader Sites). We may use Location Information and provide it to third parties to provide you with content and services that are relevant to a particular location, such as advertising, search results, dealers in the area, and direction, to evaluate and improve the Autotrader Sites, or to provide you with content and services relevant to one or more nearby dealers.\n \nPublicly Posted Information. Information that you make available to us and others via social media networks, forums, blogs, list serves, chat rooms or similar functionality is public information that we or others may share or use in accordance with the law.\n \nCombined Information and Information from Other Sources. We may combine information that you provide to us with information we receive from our affiliates and other sources, as well as with other information that is automatically collected. The combined information may include information about your use of the Sites, your use of other websites, devices and mobile applications and information from our affiliates and other sources.\n \nHow We May Use the Information We Collect\nWe may use information we collect for the following purposes:\n\n1.       for everyday business purposes, such as establishing and managing your user account, providing products and services you request, processing and collecting payments and providing customer support;\n\n2.       to create listings and advertisements for any cars and other vehicles that you list for sale with us. These lists and advertisements may appear on the Autotrader Sites and other websites, mobile applications or services of third parties;\n\n3.       to provide values and/or offers for cars that you would like to sell or trade in;\n\n4.       to offer our other products or services and/or the products or services of others to you;\n\n5.       to communicate about, and administer your participation in, special events, programs, surveys, contests, sweepstakes and other offers or promotions;\n\n6.       to enable you to interact with Autotrader and our users, dealers, manufacturers and others through various means, such as through our message boards, blogs and social media;\n\n7.       to evaluate and improve our business, including developing new products and services and analyzing the effectiveness of products, services, applications and websites;\n\n8.       to diagnose and address technical and service problems;\n\n9.       to perform data analyses, including market and consumer research, trend analysis, demographic analysis and financial analysis;\n\n10.   to deliver content (including advertising) correlating to your interests and browsing and usage history, both within the Autotrader Sites and on other websites and applications;\n\n11.   to comply with applicable legal requirements and our policies; and\n\n12.   to contact you via telephone, text or chat. We will obtain your consent to contact you when and in the manner required by law.\n\n \nApplications, Widgets and Social Media\nWe may include applications or widgets from social media providers that allow interaction or content sharing by their users. These widgets, such as a Facebook \"Share\" or \"Like\" button, are visible to you on the web page you visit. Integration between the Autotrader Sites and social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter and others may allow social media networks in which you participate to collect information about you, even when you do not explicitly activate the network's application or widget. Please visit the applicable social media network's privacy policy to better understand their data collection practices and choices they make available to you. The privacy policy of the social media network controls the collection, use and disclosure of all personal information transmitted to that network.\n\n \nAdvertising Networks\nAdvertising that is customized based on predictions generated over time from your visits across different websites, devices and mobile applications is sometimes called \"online behavioral\" or \"interest-based\" advertising. We may partner with advertising networks, which are companies that deliver targeted advertisements to consumers and generate statistics and metrics related to the delivery of interest-based advertisements. They may utilize information collected through a variety of Data Technologies to provide customization, auditing, research and reporting for us, our affiliates and other advertisers. This data collection takes place both on the Autotrader Sites and on third-party's websites and mobile applications. This process allows Autotrader and third parties to deliver targeted advertising, enhance marketing programs and help track the effectiveness of such efforts. Our advertising networks also may use this information for determining or predicting the characteristics and preferences of their respective advertising audiences and measuring the effectiveness of their advertising in accordance with their privacy policies.\n\nWe do not provide information that is directly associated with a specific person (such as name and address) to an advertising network when you interact with or view a customized advertisement. However, when you view or interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may make an assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisement.\n\nSome companies disclose when they are using interest-based advertising programs on the Autotrader Sites to deliver third-party ads or collecting information about your visit for these purposes and give you the ability to opt-out of this use of your information. You may see an icon http://media.autotrader.com/content/privacy-statement/images/daa-logo_25x26_v2.png in or around third-party advertisements on the Autotrader Sites that use interest-based advertising programs and on pages where data is collected and used for online interest-based advertising. Clicking on this icon will provide additional information about the companies and data practices that were used to deliver the ad. You can opt out of delivery of targeted advertising to you by multiple companies by visiting www.aboutads.info/choices,www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and www.evidon.com. Please note that even if you opt out, you will continue to receive advertisements, but they will not be tailored to your specific interests.\n \n \nInformation We Share\nWe do not sell or otherwise share information about you that we collect or receive, except as described below:\n\n1.

Co-Sponsored Promotions. In the event that you participate in a survey, sweepstakes, contest or other promotion that is co-sponsored by Autotrader and a third party, we may share information collected in conjunction with the survey, sweepstakes, contest or promotion, including personal information, with that third party. After the information is provided to those third parties, the subsequent use or disclosure of such information is subject to their privacy policies and practices. Surveys, sweepstakes and other promotions conducted on behalf of Autotrader and a third party will include branding from both Autotrader and the third party.\n\n4.       Promotions on behalf of Third Parties. Periodically, third parties may conduct surveys, contests, sweepstakes and other promotions for their own purpose on the Autotrader Sites. Information you provide in response to those activities is governed by their privacy policies. Surveys, sweepstakes and other promotions conducted solely for the purpose of a third party will include only the third party's branding.\n\n5.       Sellers, Dealers and Manufacturers. Information about you, including personal information and Data Technologies, may be shared with sellers, dealers and manufacturers, and their agents and third party service providers, who will use that information in accordance with their own privacy policies.

Corporate and Asset Transactions. If we sell all or substantially all of our business or sell or transfer all or a material part of our assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a substantial part of our business, we may transfer all information we have collected and stored, including personal information, to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.\n\n8.

You may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies and disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or opting out at Evidon.com or the website of the technology provider. If you choose to decline cookies or similar technologies, however, please note that certain features may not function properly or at all as a result. You may be able to adjust the use of advertising identifiers on mobile devices through the settings on your device. Finally, if you do not want to use a uniquely generated telephone number, you may choose to not call us.\n\n5.       If you do not want us to use Location Information, you can decline our initial invitation to provide that information, or opt out by changing the location services settings on your mobile device.

A \"web beacon,\" also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies. Anonymous advertising identifiers are increasingly being used on mobile devices and otherwise in a manner similar to cookies. When we refer to Data Technologies, we are including all current and similar future technologies.\nOne or more Data Technologies may be used on the Autotrader Sites and other websites and mobile applications (that may not be the Autotrader Sites) by us, by another party on our behalf, or by third parties in accordance with their privacy policies. Data Technologies may be used by us and others, on our behalf and on their own behalf, to transmit information to you or about you and connect information about you from different sources, websites, devices, and mobile applications.\n\nWe may use a uniquely generated trackable toll-free telephone number on dealer sites or in advertisements. If you call one of these uniquely generated toll-free numbers, we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) may collect non-personally identifiable information about the call (e.g. date, time, duration), as well as personally identifiable information (e.g. your name, the number from which your call originated).\n\nVideos. We may target and track the videos you view on the Sites. You consent to our tracking of your video viewing through the Site or third party social media for up to two years or as permitted by applicable law.\n \nLocation Information.

We also may collect Location Information when you visit or are in the vicinity of one of our dealers. We only collect Location Information with your permission (e.g., such as when you agree to provide it to us after you initially access or download the Autotrader Sites). We may use Location Information and provide it to third parties to provide you with content and services that are relevant to a particular location, such as advertising, search results, dealers in the area, and direction, to evaluate and improve the Autotrader Sites, or to provide you with content and services relevant to one or more nearby dealers.\n \nPublicly Posted Information. Information that you make available to us and others via social media networks, forums, blogs, list serves, chat rooms or similar functionality is public information that we or others may share or use in accordance with the law.\n \nCombined Information and Information from Other Sources. We may combine information that you provide to us with information we receive from our affiliates and other sources, as well as with other information that is automatically collected. The combined information may include information about your use of the Sites, your use of other websites, devices and mobile applications and information from our affiliates and other sources.\n \nHow We May Use the Information We Collect\nWe may use information we collect for the following purposes:\n\n1.       for everyday business purposes, such as establishing and managing your user account, providing products and services you request, processing and collecting payments and providing customer support;\n\n2.       to create listings and advertisements for any cars and other vehicles that you list for sale with us. These lists and advertisements may appear on the Autotrader Sites and other websites, mobile applications or services of third parties;\n\n3.       to provide values and/or offers for cars that you would like to sell or trade in;\n\n4.       to offer our other products or services and/or the products or services of others to you;\n\n5.       to communicate about, and administer your participation in, special events, programs, surveys, contests, sweepstakes and other offers or promotions;\n\n6.       to enable you to interact with Autotrader and our users, dealers, manufacturers and others through various means, such as through our message boards, blogs and social media;\n\n7.       to evaluate and improve our business, including developing new products and services and analyzing the effectiveness of products, services, applications and websites;\n\n8.       to diagnose and address technical and service problems;\n\n9.       to perform data analyses, including market and consumer research, trend analysis, demographic analysis and financial analysis;\n\n10.   to deliver content (including advertising) correlating to your interests and browsing and usage history, both within the Autotrader Sites and on other websites and applications;\n\n11.   to comply with applicable legal requirements and our policies; and\n\n12.   to contact you via telephone, text or chat. We will obtain your consent to contact you when and in the manner required by law.\n\n \nApplications, Widgets and Social Media\nWe may include applications or widgets from social media providers that allow interaction or content sharing by their users. These widgets, such as a Facebook \"Share\" or \"Like\" button, are visible to you on the web page you visit. Integration between the Autotrader Sites and social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter and others may allow social media networks in which you participate to collect information about you, even when you do not explicitly activate the network's application or widget. Please visit the applicable social media network's privacy policy to better understand their data collection practices and choices they make available to you. The privacy policy of the social media network controls the collection, use and disclosure of all personal information transmitted to that network.\n\n \nAdvertising Networks\nAdvertising that is customized based on predictions generated over time from your visits across different websites, devices and mobile applications is sometimes called \"online behavioral\" or \"interest-based\" advertising. We may partner with advertising networks, which are companies that deliver targeted advertisements to consumers and generate statistics and metrics related to the delivery of interest-based advertisements. They may utilize information collected through a variety of Data Technologies to provide customization, auditing, research and reporting for us, our affiliates and other advertisers. This data collection takes place both on the Autotrader Sites and on third-party's websites and mobile applications. This process allows Autotrader and third parties to deliver targeted advertising, enhance marketing programs and help track the effectiveness of such efforts. Our advertising networks also may use this information for determining or predicting the characteristics and preferences of their respective advertising audiences and measuring the effectiveness of their advertising in accordance with their privacy policies.\n\nWe do not provide information that is directly associated with a specific person (such as name and address) to an advertising network when you interact with or view a customized advertisement. However, when you view or interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may make an assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisement.\n\nSome companies disclose when they are using interest-based advertising programs on the Autotrader Sites to deliver third-party ads or collecting information about your visit for these purposes and give you the ability to opt-out of this use of your information. You may see an icon http://media.autotrader.com/content/privacy-statement/images/daa-logo_25x26_v2.png in or around third-party advertisements on the Autotrader Sites that use interest-based advertising programs and on pages where data is collected and used for online interest-based advertising. Clicking on this icon will provide additional information about the companies and data practices that were used to deliver the ad. You can opt out of delivery of targeted advertising to you by multiple companies by visiting www.aboutads.info/choices,www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and www.evidon.com. Please note that even if you opt out, you will continue to receive advertisements, but they will not be tailored to your specific interests.\n \n \nInformation We Share\nWe do not sell or otherwise share information about you that we collect or receive, except as described below:\n\n1.       Affiliates. We may share information about you, including personal information, with our corporate affiliates, who will use it in accordance with their privacy policies.

We require such providers to maintain information about you as confidential and to use the information only to perform the services specified by us in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.\n\n3.       Co-Sponsored Promotions. In the event that you participate in a survey, sweepstakes, contest or other promotion that is co-sponsored by Autotrader and a third party, we may share information collected in conjunction with the survey, sweepstakes, contest or promotion, including personal information, with that third party. After the information is provided to those third parties, the subsequent use or disclosure of such information is subject to their privacy policies and practices. Surveys, sweepstakes and other promotions conducted on behalf of Autotrader and a third party will include branding from both Autotrader and the third party.\n\n4.       Promotions on behalf of Third Parties. Periodically, third parties may conduct surveys, contests, sweepstakes and other promotions for their own purpose on the Autotrader Sites. Information you provide in response to those activities is governed by their privacy policies. Surveys, sweepstakes and other promotions conducted solely for the purpose of a third party will include only the third party's branding.\n\n5.       Sellers, Dealers and Manufacturers. Information about you, including personal information and Data Technologies, may be shared with sellers, dealers and manufacturers, and their agents and third party service providers, who will use that information in accordance with their own privacy policies. For example:\n\n1.       If you are interested in a particular listing of a car for sale, information about you may be shared with the seller of that particular car or similar cars or dealers in your area;\n\n2.       If you are considering trading in a car, we may provide information about you to dealers who participate in our trade-in program and other dealers in your area;\n\n3.

Corporate and Asset Transactions. If we sell all or substantially all of our business or sell or transfer all or a material part of our assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a substantial part of our business, we may transfer all information we have collected and stored, including personal information, to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.\n\n8.       Other. We may access or disclose information, including personal information, to:\n\n1.       protect or defend our interests and the legal rights or property of Autotrader and our affiliates;\n\n2.       protect the rights, interests, safety and security of users of the Autotrader Sites or members of the public;\n\n3.       protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or\n\n4.       comply with prudent legal practice as we may determine, and applicable law or legal process.\n\n \nYour Choices\nYou are entitled to make certain choices about how we communicate with you.\n\n1.       You may choose not to provide personal information, even though that might impact your ability to register or receive a particular product or service.\n\n2.       If you do not want to receive marketing email from us, you can follow the unsubscribe link provided in those emails.\n\n3.       If you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements, you can opt out as discussed in the \"Advertising Networks\" section above.\n\n4.       You have a number of choices regarding certain Data Technologies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser's setting to decline cookies if you prefer. You may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies and disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or opting out at Evidon.com or the website of the technology provider. If you choose to decline cookies or similar technologies, however, please note that certain features may not function properly or at all as a result. You may be able to adjust the use of advertising identifiers on mobile devices through the settings on your device. Finally, if you do not want to use a uniquely generated telephone number, you may choose to not call us.\n\n5.       If you do not want us to use Location Information, you can decline our initial invitation to provide that information, or opt out by changing the location services settings on your mobile device. However, please note that certain features may not function properly or at all as a result if you opt out.\n\n \nYour California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83 entitles California users to request information concerning whether a business has disclosed certain information about you to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.

The last few times I have used it not only is it glitchy and freeze up, but the quality of the results were not inclusive of many many other results found on other competing websites.  Step it up or I will start my car searches where the results can be found.  I have also sold a few cars on Autotrader.  The last time I TRIED to sell a car I was SHOCKED how expensive it was.  Tried it for a few weeks with only a few calls, all tire kickers.  I put the same car on another site after a few weeks on Autotrader and we had ten calls in two days and the car was sold within a week.  So, again poor results.  Autotrader needs to lower the cost to list a car to solve their two biggest problems.  1)Not enough listings 2)because it’s to expensive to list a vehicle.  Look, I think Autotrader has been the goto in car searches/selling over the years, but they got too big for their britches!

Also maybe have the private seller ones show us at least a state that it’s located in so we know if we want to even bother with it! That would be cool. And one more idea: can we please have an option to get rid of a vehicle in our saved searches that doesn’t meet our needs so we don’t have to keep checking it again and again?

I find it very useful.  I found my most recent vehicle purchase on it.

Then I have to restart my search from the beginning and try to scroll back to where I left off.  I think to myself “maybe I should check to see if there’s an update that fixes this.”   Yes!  An update there is.  Great, let’s try this out again.  Problem definitely “fixed.”   It’s not crashing out of the searches any more because it will only let me see....oh, I dunno....50 of the results?   Out of 1600.  Yeah that’s just perfect.  That’s exactly what I was hoping for.  Just show me those 50 cars.  And let’s forget all about the other 1550 I might be interested in.  God forbid you let me see them, because obviously your app can’t handle it without crashing.  I’m rolling my eyes so hard that if I was driving, I would crash like your app.  Or, I just update my brain to the new software version that only lets me see 5 cars on the road at a time, and then I would never crash.

It would be nice to have the same sort and filter capability that you have on the original search (for example, priced low to high, closest distance etc). This would be especially useful if you have saved a number of vehicles over time. \n\nAlso, when a vehicle is no longer available and it shows as unavailable in your saved cars view, it would be nice to know specifically which vehicle was delisted (location, dealer/seller info etc). \n\nFinally, as others have stated, listing a car for sale on Autotrader is way to expensive considering the limited responses received.

If you search for cars and set a mileage or price parameter, lets say under 20,000 miles under $10,000. The search returns 80% of your results with cars that have unlisted mileage. Unlisted mileage doesn’t mean they forgot to list the mileage, it means the mileage is so high they don’t want you to know until you look into the vehicle. There’s no way to exclude these high mileage vehicles (or unlisted as they say), \u0026 its a huge waste of time to make people view them. You can’t sort them out to show only actual low mile vehicles, they mix the unlisted in with lets say 15,000. Even if you sort from low to high mileage, still mixes them all up. They could have made a minimum mileage search option, or a “exclude keyword”, but what they should do, is FORCE the advertiser to list the mileage. It is what it is, so put it in the ad. Auto Trader, you need to fix this, and stop making this a frustrating experience. Should be easy and enjoyable. Your developers clearly don’t USE the app, just test it.

It’s had its ups and downs, but overall it’s been my go-to car shopping app. Love the saved car and saved search options and enjoy the mix of dealer and private party listings.\nWith that said, there are a couple of areas where the developers could make some improvements:\n1. You can’t modify your saved searches. Once you have saved a search, you can’t change the max price, you can’t later add extra criteria to it and you can’t even rename it. I’ve been waiting for this feature for years and I’m still waiting.\n2. You can’t see the location for private party listings. Not sure which update caused this, but for a while now there’s no way of telling what state/town the seller is located. With dealer listings they give you the full address, website and phone number - with the private party sales I have to guess from the landscaping if it’s a quick drive or a long plane ride away from me.\n3. Old abandoned listings: I sometimes save a listing and it’s still on the website a year or two later. Is it still for sale? Does anybody check with the seller? Anybody care at AT? Maybe a days listed column would help consumers get an idea of how long it’s been listed and also sellers should be required to update their ads once in a blue moon.\nThat’s all I’ve got for now...still love the app","title":"Great app, been using it for years","userName":"Buckolaci"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1832832284","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2017-10-07T11:44:55Z","rating":4,"review":"I agree with a prior review. AT was clean and generally simple. The best in my opinion. Not a bunch of hidden menus and options with overly complicate (IT nerdy) ways to use the tool. Competitor tools tend to overwhelm the user and are confusing to navigate. I’d set all of my advanced settings, multiple vehicles at times, and hit search. And, I’d save the search or vehicle(s) and periodically set alerts. If I were to improve anything - realizing AT must satisfy both the retailers/sellers and buyers experience - I’d continue efforts to only show vehicles asked for under set query parameters. Meaning, if I say Toyota Tundra CrewMax, under 75k miles, max $30k, within 25 miles, don’t show me vehicles that don’t match this criteria. It’s annoying and I abandon tools that do this. Asking the user if they’d like to see similar vehicles or those further out or more dollars, etc. would be fine - though essentially running a finite report criteria and getting back incorrect results is a pain.

There are various filters you can apply, in addition to being able to save certain vehicles and even your searches.\n\nThe reason I rated this three stars rather than five is due to the application performance. The app tends to lag and delay response time to scrolling significantly. The result amount listed was tested at 127 results and 100. I do not think the app should be struggling to display these results, and I don’t think it does, however I believe the advertisements cause this latency issue. As they load in continuously, the app must focus on loading the pictures in for the ads, in addition to the specific dimensions. It seems that when the ads is loading in, the performance drops. When this happens, it seems to slow any scrolling, even in the filter screen.\n\nAs this looks like a big con, and to me it kinda is, the app still gives you the ability to search cars to a tee that fit your style.","title":"App Structure needs fixing.","userName":"Arthur.Wolford"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"5967159703","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-05-19T20:19:11Z","rating":2,"review":"I don’t usually review apps, but I’m hoping if enough people do they’ll fix whatever is wrong with this thing.

I should be able to select multiple makes/models/trims in a list the way the website allows. I should be able to narrow down mileage limitations more than just the 5 allowed on the app. I could go on and on, but it’s nothing that other users haven’t already complained about.
