      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I had the free trial run and though i was sad for the lack of dubs i did still enjoy much of the service. I liked the “pay for what you want” model since im really not interested in anything but the anime and a few vrv selects. However, when i stopped my premium subscription and went to the ad based model, everything changed.<br /><br />There are lots of ads (and almost alway the same 5 ads, which is itself a minor nuisance). But the number of ads isnt the issue the coding regarding ads is buggy. Sometimes ads will play over one another. Sometimes youll make it through the ad roll and watch 4 seconds of content before another ad comes on for no apparent reason. Sometimes the video youre watching resumes during the ad, you cant see your video but you can hear it. You also cant pause your video while this is happening because the ad is covering your video controls. If you attempt to touch the screen you’re redirected to the website associated with that ad. And worst of all is when an ad refuses to load, and covers tbe screen for 10+ minutes, and during that time your video restarts and you can hear the video but not see it and not control it, but this time the situation is worse because the problem is indefinitely long. All these problems have happened for me multiple times. <br /><br />So if youre willing to pay premium for the content that’s there, great, if not, dont do the free thing until they get their ad rolls ironed out.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’m normally one to never complain or do many of these reviews. So if your reading this then you can know this is my honest option. When I found VRV I was unsure what to think so I went and did the premium because I have been wanting the ability to download stuff videos I could see on the go. The no ads was a bonus. I have been using this app for about two weeks and have loved it. I found the app though a bit weird at first it was very geared to keep things separate and not throw everything into a pile to dig throw. It’s made finding some of my favorite anime’s and shows very easy. But being as I got this for the ability to download I for some reason being the bumbling dork I unknowingly found one big bug. Since I am on the move a lot with my blue tooth head phones find that every so often I am drawn phone is off in my pocket to un-pause it with my head phones pushing the button. Well if I do my Apple Music app turns on. And if I am to open my phone while VRV is on and I’m watching something I downloaded it will stop working all together I have tried just about everything so far the only way to fix it is to unload the app then re-download it I have tried to delete the shows and re-download them. That didn’t seem to work. So if you do get this app be aware of this so you don’t end up at the airport or on that road trip with nothing because Apple Music decided to turn on and break everything.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Been using the app for some time now, and at first I was satisfied. Moved from crunchyroll over, and was impressed by the line up at the time. But then as years passed, creators have been somewhat soft. I understand that there are limitations or boundaries, but why, and this is figurative speech, castrate artistic ability. There have been gems here and there that have been worthwhile and satisfying, but anime as whole should be limitless. It’s matter of escapism to tell stories, experiencing emotions, to create memories. Our opinions alone , are “our opinions”. They shouldn’t force a creator into a narrative they don’t want. People will agree or disagree, but in the end let not one person’s opinions be casted for everyone, but rather hear the collective of opinions from the actual people who go the mile to enjoy the content of the artist. I definitely see this app having potential if the people running it would not let their personal or political bias ruin it for the rest.<br /><br />...Oh and some the functions for seasons of a series are not working (I.e One Punch Man). It says that it has three seasons, but only shows season one without being able to change it. Have yet to try on other viewing platform other than IOS, but an update or fix would be nice.</p>

Policy has an effective date of: 5/25/2018\n\nThis Privacy Policy governs the VRV website (the “Site“), mobile site, application and/or other service, regardless of how distributed, transmitted, published or broadcast (each, a “Service“ and collectively, the “Services“), provided by Ellation, Inc., its parent, subsidiaries and/or affiliates (“we“, “us“ or “our“) that links to this Privacy Policy, which is binding on all those who access, visit and/or use the Services. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive when you use the Services. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Services, and when you access, download, purchase or use any information, services, products or content offered through the Services. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.\n\nThe Information We Collect\nIn the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain information that could reasonably be used to contact you or identify you personally (“Personal Information“). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and mailing address. Personal Information also includes your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier“) that is associated, on a persistent or on-going basis, with your computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a “Device“) you use to access the Services.\n\nSome features on the Services may ask users to provide certain information that is not personally identifiable, such as city or state of residence, date of birth and gender (such demographic information is referred to collectively, along with Usage Information (defined below), as “Non-Personal Information“). We may use Non-Personal Information for a variety of purposes, including enhancing or otherwise improving the Services. Non-Personal Information is generally non-identifying, but, if we associate it with you as an identifiable individual, we will treat it as Personal Information.\n\nWhen visitors use our Services, we and our third-party service providers also may automatically collect some non-personally identifiable information such as the type of computer operating system you are using (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox), the domain name of the Internet service provider you are using your activity while using our Services (e.g., which of our pages you have viewed, the content viewed, and the advertisements you have been shown) (“Usage Information“). When you download a content player on one of our Services (a “Player“), we may record that a download took place. When you launch a Player, our servers may automatically record that information. When the Player checks for new updates, it may also automatically send the version number and operating system information to our servers. We collect this information for the purposes set forth below in How We Use the Information We Collect.\n\nPlease be aware that when you register to become a VRV member or member of any of our other Services (each, a “Member“), other users of the Services may be able to see your screen or user name, in addition to any comments or submissions that you post or submit via the Services.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive when you use the Services. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Services, and when you access, download, purchase or use any information, services, products or content offered through the Services. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.\n\nThe Information We Collect\nIn the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain information that could reasonably be used to contact you or identify you personally (“Personal Information“). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and mailing address. Personal Information also includes your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier“) that is associated, on a persistent or on-going basis, with your computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a “Device“) you use to access the Services.\n\nSome features on the Services may ask users to provide certain information that is not personally identifiable, such as city or state of residence, date of birth and gender (such demographic information is referred to collectively, along with Usage Information (defined below), as “Non-Personal Information“). We may use Non-Personal Information for a variety of purposes, including enhancing or otherwise improving the Services. Non-Personal Information is generally non-identifying, but, if we associate it with you as an identifiable individual, we will treat it as Personal Information.\n\nWhen visitors use our Services, we and our third-party service providers also may automatically collect some non-personally identifiable information such as the type of computer operating system you are using (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox), the domain name of the Internet service provider you are using your activity while using our Services (e.g., which of our pages you have viewed, the content viewed, and the advertisements you have been shown) (“Usage Information“). When you download a content player on one of our Services (a “Player“), we may record that a download took place. When you launch a Player, our servers may automatically record that information. When the Player checks for new updates, it may also automatically send the version number and operating system information to our servers. We collect this information for the purposes set forth below in How We Use the Information We Collect.\n\nPlease be aware that when you register to become a VRV member or member of any of our other Services (each, a “Member“), other users of the Services may be able to see your screen or user name, in addition to any comments or submissions that you post or submit via the Services. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your real name as your screen or user name to the extent that allows others to identify you.\n\nCollection Methods/Cookies/Tracking Technologies\nOur Services may use software technology such as “cookies,“ “flash cookies,“ “web beacons,“ “embedded scripts,“ or other similar technologies (collectively referred to as “Tracking Technologies“). These Tracking Technologies are used to help tailor our content, allow visitors to move between associated websites without logging into each site, and other purposes related to our management of the Services. Cookies are small text files stored locally on your Device that help store user preferences. You can learn more about cookies at http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ and http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/. Web beacons or “clear gifs“ are small pieces of code placed on websites used to collect advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. We may use Tracking Technologies to determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit various sections of our Services and to improve or customize the content, offerings and advertisements on our Services. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience through our Services, such as to recognize you by your user name and when you return to our Services, and save your password and password-protective areas.\n\nWe, our third-party service providers and/or partners may also use Tracking Technologies, such as cookies, to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Services. Moreover, we, our third-party service providers and/or our partners may use Tracking Technologies to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page.\n\nIn addition to the Tracking Technologies, data collected on our web servers supply us with aggregate Usage Information about the number of visits to different pages on our Services. We use such aggregate Usage Information to improve access to content based on our visitor's browsers and operating system types to make our content available to as many users as possible.\n\nYou can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser.

had the free trial run and though i was sad for the lack of dubs i did still enjoy much of the service. I liked the “pay for what you want” model since im really not interested in anything but the anime and a few vrv selects. However, when i stopped my premium subscription and went to the ad based model, everything changed.\n\nThere are lots of ads (and almost alway the same 5 ads, which is itself a minor nuisance). But the number of ads isnt the issue the coding regarding ads is buggy. Sometimes ads will play over one another. Sometimes youll make it through the ad roll and watch 4 seconds of content before another ad comes on for no apparent reason. Sometimes the video youre watching resumes during the ad, you cant see your video but you can hear it. You also cant pause your video while this is happening because the ad is covering your video controls. If you attempt to touch the screen you’re redirected to the website associated with that ad. And worst of all is when an ad refuses to load, and covers tbe screen for 10+ minutes, and during that time your video restarts and you can hear the video but not see it and not control it, but this time the situation is worse because the problem is indefinitely long. All these problems have happened for me multiple times. \n\nSo if youre willing to pay premium for the content that’s there, great, if not, dont do the free thing until they get their ad rolls ironed out.","title":"Big Difference Paid vs Unpaid","userName":"EvbyMan"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2551756628","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-05-15T19:30:18Z","rating":4,"review":"I’m normally one to never complain or do many of these reviews. So if your reading this then you can know this is my honest option. When I found VRV I was unsure what to think so I went and did the premium because I have been wanting the ability to download stuff videos I could see on the go. The no ads was a bonus. I have been using this app for about two weeks and have loved it. I found the app though a bit weird at first it was very geared to keep things separate and not throw everything into a pile to dig throw. It’s made finding some of my favorite anime’s and shows very easy. But being as I got this for the ability to download I for some reason being the bumbling dork I unknowingly found one big bug. Since I am on the move a lot with my blue tooth head phones find that every so often I am drawn phone is off in my pocket to un-pause it with my head phones pushing the button. Well if I do my Apple Music app turns on. And if I am to open my phone while VRV is on and I’m watching something I downloaded it will stop working all together I have tried just about everything so far the only way to fix it is to unload the app then re-download it I have tried to delete the shows and re-download them. That didn’t seem to work. So if you do get this app be aware of this so you don’t end up at the airport or on that road trip with nothing because Apple Music decided to turn on and break everything.","title":"The good and bad","userName":"Wolfboy9"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6855600568","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2021-01-11T03:56:23Z","rating":3,"review":"Been using the app for some time now, and at first I was satisfied. Moved from crunchyroll over, and was impressed by the line up at the time. But then as years passed, creators have been somewhat soft. I understand that there are limitations or boundaries, but why, and this is figurative speech, castrate artistic ability. There have been gems here and there that have been worthwhile and satisfying, but anime as whole should be limitless. It’s matter of escapism to tell stories, experiencing emotions, to create memories. Our opinions alone , are “our opinions”. They shouldn’t force a creator into a narrative they don’t want. People will agree or disagree, but in the end let not one person’s opinions be casted for everyone, but rather hear the collective of opinions from the actual people who go the mile to enjoy the content of the artist. I definitely see this app having potential if the people running it would not let their personal or political bias ruin it for the rest.\n\n...Oh and some the functions for seasons of a series are not working (I.e One Punch Man). It says that it has three seasons, but only shows season one without being able to change it.

Now for those who are just complaining that they do three ads per break that's been Crunchyroll (the company that own vrv) thing forever. Now the ones complaining about how the ads work and the overlapping that's a legit complaint/problem that they should address but since I pay for no ads I've never had this issue. That's why I give the app 5 stars. Not my biggest and really only complaints deal with the service. I really would like for vrv to offer a yearly subscription model like they do for Crunchyroll and the other partnered subscription Funimation. It makes it so much easier the just pay $50-$60 once a year and get all the anime I want for the year. A lot of times I'll forget about the monthly renewal and spend the money on other bills or food before they charge me. So I'd really like to see that feature ASAP. Also I know it's not ALL vrv's fault but I wish the process of getting everything on Funimation over the vrv was quicker or at the very least like you can link your account to Crunchyroll or vice versa I feel like it should be an option to link you account to funimation. That way I don't average to pay for multiple services due to vrv not having all the content that is currently available on funimation.","title":"The app vs the service","userName":"cyrich"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6426622488","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-14T00:38:45Z","rating":2,"review":"I have had numerous problems with the app. From it not recognizing I’m a premium member multiple times.

Now on top of that I am having issues to where I can’t download offline. It starts and waits then immediately fails. Offline viewing was a highlight of VRV.

Whether it be a new episode for a series or last episode from a completed series, it will not load... I’ve tried everything. Signing out. Restart. Re-installing. I even reset my device and got the same, thing. I loved this app when I first got into it, but recently it has been nothing but headaches. They aren’t even aligned with Crunchyroll anymore and did not announce it, yet they announce all the ‘news and great’’ companies they are working with. Crunchyroll was on of the main reasons to have this app and at least as far as I am aware, Crunchyroll actually works. I am extremely disappointed from where this app was 2 years ago to where it is today.

For the past month when I was a premium crunchyroll member only I had no issues. I recently found that I should cancel my crunchyroll and pay for vrv only. Seemed like a no brainer considering all you get so I went ahead and purchased it. In the week since I have been losing subtitles to anime shows I was either already watching or in future episodes I had not watched yet. After refreshing the app it would seem to work just fine again. I have refreshed 100x now and that doesn’t fix it anymore. Went online to find out this had been a steady issue for over a year now. One solution I found after I couldn’t get any show to show subtitles anymore was to delete the entire app and reinstall the app. Who would want to do that and lose so many episodes? Well after still unsuccessfully getting subtitles to work again.... guess what this guy did? He deleted the app and reinstalled. Made sure subs were working again watching 3 episodes back to back. Yay they work again. Downloaded 45 episodes to be on the safe side and have some shows to binge watch on my long train rides to and from work. After the first episode.... every other anime’s subs are broken again. It’s not like I can watch the dubs in time before Funimation is removed on November 1st.

I have an iPhone XR running the latest version of iOS 12 and I have not ever been able to sign in on the app. I looked through the reviews and I found someone else with the same problem. Basically what happens is I'll input my email and password (just like I would on any other device) and as soon as I hit enter it says \"whoops check your inputs\". Now, I open Safari and go to the VRV website, input the exact same email and password (even go ahead and save it to my password keychain) and boom! login with no issues. \n\nI looked through the FAQ page trying to find a solution or a form to contact the developer but I haven't had any luck, just a bunch of useless FAQ irrelevant to my issue. The only remedy I've found is linking my VRV account to my Crunchyroll account so I can at least watch CR content on my phone, but it would be nice to have the full VRV app if I want to watch HarmonQuest or anything else that's not on Crunchyroll. As a paying customer for a while now, I would appreciate it if the developer would at least read this review in hopes that they might be able to rectify the problem... Otherwise what's the point of paying for the service if I can't even use the app. Might as well switch to Crunchyroll only and save a couple bucks.","title":"I would love to give it a chance","userName":"zeusg89"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2974345190","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-07-26T23:18:53Z","rating":4,"review":"So to start off I don’t want to bag on this app it does have a great selection of shows, movies, etc. that you can browse through, and I would’ve gone to the support page to explain the situation there that I’m having but there’s no real way to let them know on it or in it for that matter so you basically have to come to the review page and hopefully they read these to figure out how they can better make that app for everyone so I’m really here just to let them know or let whoever cares and know that you’re missing the seven deadly sins series from Crunchyroll on this VRV app and probably a lot of other ones that don’t come to mind or haven’t looked up yet, and the application on my phone is where I started my Premium account but as I tried to use my premium account on my game console (PS4) it was making me get a premium account on my PlayStation 4 when I already have a one, so do I have to have separate premium accounts for every device I have or is that just a bug in the system? but all in all I really enjoyed this app, just those small minor things also “30 seconds forward” option wouldn’t hurt as well LOL","title":"Not too bad but, could go for an up date for the better","userName":"RexTortuga"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2040949299","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2017-12-30T12:23:12Z","rating":1,"review":"This App Is By Far The Worst, The Most Irritating, And The Most Glitchy Official App I’ve Ever Seen, And All Of That Has To Do With The Ads, The Ads Are So Broken, That They Break The Video Itself, First Off When It Reaches The Black Bars It Plays An Ad, But It Doesn’t Just Play One Ad, It Plays Three!
