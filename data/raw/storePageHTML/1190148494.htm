We appreciate the jargon-free approach to workouts and meal planning—for example, combining Booty Boot Camp routines with a delicious omnivore diet. Jillian motivates us marvelously with her polished videos, offering clear instructions, endless encouragement, and some bumpin’ music.</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I feel like I joined a cult and drank the koolaid, because I worship Jillian and will follow her anywhere. I cannot stress how perfect this is for me. I’ve never counted calories or really dieted but I’m sick of trying to figure out what to eat and just wanted someone to tell me. I love that I could put in my food preferences and bam I now have all of my food planned out, seven days a week. And the recipes are *chef’s kiss*. With such an amazing variety. I’m so excited to cook and eat them! Not to mention a year workout plan based on my age, weight, height, goals, and on how in shape I am. On top of that, you have access to all other kinds of workouts and all of her dvds! And after the workout you can say whether it was easy and she’ll make it harder, or hard and she’ll make it easier. Or if like me it was perfect, she’ll keep it consistent. When you factor in that you basically have a nutritionist and personal trainer, the yearly subscription is INSANELY good. And Jillian is the best. I have used her workouts for so long and she always makes me sweat. Which is saying something cuz I’m in pretty good shape and have an active job. I’m excited to see what she can do for me with a whole year of planning my food and giving me new routines!!</p>

      <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>So I’ve been using the app for approximately 2-3 weeks now. I love the workouts! I love that it syncs to Apple Watch without me needing to press workout (sometimes I forget to do that). It was nice that there was a fun message from Jillian when I completed the workout lol. Here are my cons: the app should probably have  more individuality to it such as how many days a week do I want to work out and how long I’d like the workouts to be, the iPad app does not sync with iPhone/Apple Watch activity-so I basically didn’t not receive credit for the 45 minute/404 calorie workout I just completed as for as the activity and health app is concerned. As far as the completion message, it’s been the exact same one every day I complete. No one says the exact same thing all the time...even if they did, they would know that I prefer variety (making the “relationship” closer to reality). I wish recipes could be suggested based on different budget ranges but I realize that may be far fetched. And what is up with the 15s alerts...for a 20s exercise. If you’re meaning to give a halfway marker that is off...after 5s of an intense exercise hearing that I still have more than half to go is more discouraging than encouraging.<br /><br />Overall...if it stayed exactly the same it’s still a great workout app. Focusing on the cons would just make it more comprehensive...making it the best workout app. And who wouldn’t want to be the best?!</p>

We will also consider if and how we can minimise over time the personal data that we use, and if we can anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you or identify you, in which case we may use that information without further notice to you.\n\nLegal basis for processing personal information (EEA visitors only)\n\nIf you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, We are the controller of your personal information and our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collected it.\n\nIf we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to contact you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).\n\nYour Rights and Choices\n\nUnder certain circumstances, by applicable Data Privacy Law you may have the right to:\n\nRequest information about whether we hold personal information about you, and, if so, what that information is and why we are holding/using it;\nRequest access to your personal information (commonly known as a \"data subject access request\"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;\nRequest correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected;\nRequest erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see (e) below);\nObject to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes;\nObject to automated decision-making including profiling, that is not to be subject of any automated decision-making by us using your personal information or profiling of you;\nRequest the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it;\nRequest transfer of your personal information in an electronic and structured form to you or to another party (commonly known as a right to “data portability”). This enables you to take your data from us in an electronically useable format and to be able to transfer your data to another party in an electronically useable format; and\nWithdraw consent. In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes to which you originally agreed, unless we have another proper and legitimate basis for doing so.\nIf you wish to exercise your rights related to your Personal Data (including the rights set out above), please contact us.\nWhile you will generally not be required to pay a fee to access your Personal Data or to exercise any of your other statutory rights, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly completely unfounded or excessive or decline to comply with such requests where permitted by applicable Data Privacy Law.\nYou also have certain options with respect to the use of cookies and other tracking technologies on our site, including for the purposes of online interest-based advertising, as set out in our Cookie Policy https://www.jillianmichaels.com/policies/cookies.\nWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it and to prevent unauthorised modification of your personal information.\nYou also have the right to lodge a complaint about our processing of your Personal Data with the body regulating data protection in the country or state / province in which you live.\nHow to contact us?\n\nWe welcome questions and comments about this Privacy Policy and our privacy practices. If we receive a complaint from you about how we have handled your Personal Data, we will investigate and determine what action we should take to resolve the complaint. We will contact you within a reasonable time and may request more information to assist us with our investigation. We aim to resolve all complaints in a timely manner.

I cannot stress how perfect this is for me. I’ve never counted calories or really dieted but I’m sick of trying to figure out what to eat and just wanted someone to tell me. I love that I could put in my food preferences and bam I now have all of my food planned out, seven days a week. And the recipes are *chef’s kiss*. With such an amazing variety. I’m so excited to cook and eat them! Not to mention a year workout plan based on my age, weight, height, goals, and on how in shape I am. On top of that, you have access to all other kinds of workouts and all of her dvds! And after the workout you can say whether it was easy and she’ll make it harder, or hard and she’ll make it easier. Or if like me it was perfect, she’ll keep it consistent. When you factor in that you basically have a nutritionist and personal trainer, the yearly subscription is INSANELY good. And Jillian is the best. I have used her workouts for so long and she always makes me sweat. Which is saying something cuz I’m in pretty good shape and have an active job. I’m excited to see what she can do for me with a whole year of planning my food and giving me new routines!!","title":"This is EXACTLY what I was looking for","userName":"SpicerNerd"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2104830991","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-01-19T14:43:24Z","rating":4,"review":"So I’ve been using the app for approximately 2-3 weeks now. I love the workouts! I love that it syncs to Apple Watch without me needing to press workout (sometimes I forget to do that). It was nice that there was a fun message from Jillian when I completed the workout lol. Here are my cons: the app should probably have  more individuality to it such as how many days a week do I want to work out and how long I’d like the workouts to be, the iPad app does not sync with iPhone/Apple Watch activity-so I basically didn’t not receive credit for the 45 minute/404 calorie workout I just completed as for as the activity and health app is concerned. As far as the completion message, it’s been the exact same one every day I complete. No one says the exact same thing all the time...even if they did, they would know that I prefer variety (making the “relationship” closer to reality). I wish recipes could be suggested based on different budget ranges but I realize that may be far fetched. And what is up with the 15s alerts...for a 20s exercise. If you’re meaning to give a halfway marker that is off...after 5s of an intense exercise hearing that I still have more than half to go is more discouraging than encouraging.\n\nOverall...if it stayed exactly the same it’s still a great workout app. Focusing on the cons would just make it more comprehensive...making it the best workout app. And who wouldn’t want to be the best?!","title":"Needs work but pretty amazing","userName":"faiths14"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6224756059","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-21T17:07:29Z","developerResponse":{"id":16932841,"body":" Hi Reflux bb!

Having access to her DVD’s is a awesome bonus! I truly appreciate how dynamic and unique her exercises are, it truly keeps your interest when you’re not doing the same boring, redundant workouts.  I previously used a different workout app for the past 10 years \u0026 I got very bored with the repetitive workouts.  I purchased this app 2 weeks ago \u0026 I’m loving this app! \nIf I could provide some suggestions that I’ve seen others also voice, the app would be even better. \n1) would be great if you can input your own individual workouts (ie-runs etc) into the calendar. It truly gives members the ability to track workouts and view more precise schedules. \n2) I love the set up of each separate program in the premium program workouts, however, is there a way to choose individual workouts randomly (besides hopping around between premium program workouts) ? I prefer to start my week with weight training with lower body first day, upper body second day, abs third day, total body on the fourth day, and typically run or HIIT on the 5th day. \n3) when I have committed to one specific premium program (ie-low impact routine), some days seem to be repeats almost identically to the ones that you complete within next few days. Bottom line, if the app was more customizable for members, this app would be perfect!","title":"Love the app","userName":"Reflux bb"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6181734524","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-07-10T15:58:53Z","developerResponse":{"id":16627778,"body":"Thank you so much for your 5-Star review we're happy to know you're enjoying the app!

I like being able to work out at home, alone or with friends and family.  Things can get crazy around here so there are times I’ve stopped working out for a couple days and even a couple months.  No problem with this app I can jump right in wherever my current fitness level is!  I do not like wasting time, so I want to feel like I’ve worked hard but I don’t like having a miserably difficult workout either.  Jillians app gives you different levels to choose from, the opportunity to provide workout feedback, and modifications for each exercise.  I also appreciate the variety of workouts available and I have used the yoga, hiit, 6 keys, and several others.  Which brings me to another feature I love!!! - the ability to preview each exercise in the routine before starting or even afterward if there’s a move you want to work on alone. A very well thought out app!\nI eat a plant based diet and the recipes I’ve tried so far are delicious!  The app offers meal plans according to your dietary preferences.

But then I decided to re-commit I’ve been doing a 30 day workout that six days on one day off and i actually show up. I also decided to try to use the meal planning option. They give you a complete grocery list for the week with the ability to check off items as you get them in the store. You can say how many portions you want how much meal prep you want to do and you can also say if you like or dislike the items (so things don’t reappear) and there are a variety of diets you can cover. I wish they would let you be a little more specific with allergies.. I’ve got some weird ones like cabbage and kiwi. But that would really be my only flaw. It is definitely worth the 15 bucks/m cause you get a personal grocery assistant and tons of different workouts to to choose from and videos with instruction. give it a shot it’s better than a gym, cheaper and covid friendly. about me - 5’2 130lbs at the start 122 now aged 32. was pretty fit until ligament surgery on my ankle last year. this is helping me gain back my calf, thigh and glut muscles lost during recovery and PT.","title":"worth it","userName":"Stephynot"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2064025854","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-01-06T23:55:42Z","rating":3,"review":"First, I love Jillian. I have done so many of her programs. I listen to her podcast and she is just wonderful. Having said that, I am beyond frustrated with this app. The concepts is incredible! The detail that went into this is just insane and we have to all bow at the level of hard work that Jillian and her team of developers had to go through. \nHaving said that, you have 3 seconds to go from one exercise to the next and it’s pretty much a complete surprise what’s coming up next unless you have memorized every single exercise she performs. During the three seconds that you get before moving to the next move, it is grayed out so you can’t see if it’s a standing move or a lay-down move or bench or what. You find out when the grey is gone and you discover you are on the ground with a dumbbell when you were suppose to be standing in a lunge. Then you are scrambling to get into form and get your weights and bam, the move is over after you got two seconds to perform it. I connect my phone to my TV and blow the screen up and I still can BARELY tell what a move is if at all. Just take away the grey during the 3 second timer so we can see what she is doing and try to be in the correct position before the timer starts. That would make this app 100 stars for me.","title":"So close to perfect","userName":"Rrp366"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"4033693041","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2019-04-19T17:58:22Z","developerResponse":{"id":8350811,"body":"Woohoo!

I also greatly appreciate the variety of workout plans available. A few things that I wish would be fixed or improved: slightly more variety to the general provided music (great base just could use a few more general songs so they don’t repeat before the end of a 20 minute workout), sometimes the interface has some bugs (but that’s unavoidable I guess), and last but not least I wish that I could link this to my Fitbit!!! Instead, I have to manually log it into my Fitbit tracker but that is by far the biggest thing I see to improve upon. I understand this may be a Fitbit brand issue and that the two will never link but I think it would be so great if it did! Id also love to see a stretching program (like how the workouts are done) but one that’s focused on good quality stretching. Overall I’m happy with the app though, it motivates me to workout because I can do it at home and I detest going to the gym.","title":"Great app","userName":"kapow2019"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"2454329570","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2018-04-22T14:35:28Z","rating":5,"review":"I was so excited to discover this app.  I used to use her Ripped in 30 workout religiously and was thrilled with those results.

Happy to say that the metrics behind this app seem to do their job perfectly.  One week in and no complaints about the workouts at all.  I get an age-appropriate (and fitness level appropriate) butt-kicking every day. The areas for improvement that I would suggest are:\n1. I have had some loading issues and found that if I load the next workout as soon as I finish the workout for the day, it goes much smoother\n2. As others have mentioned, some tips, or exercise demos would be great.  I know most of the exercises I have seen so far from previous Jillian workouts but not all.

I use this app 3-4 times a week as a supplement to running and barre classes.  Up until a few weeks ago I would have given this 5 stars.  However, I updated to the latest version and am disappointed.  My biggest beef is with the time of the workouts. When I start it will tell me that it is 25 minutes and 20 seconds.  By the time I get to the cool down the time has decreased to 20 minutes.  Even the 7 minute workouts decrease to 6 minutes.  These are short workouts- losing 20% is not cool!!  Where is the time going?  Like I said I have used this for a year and this never happened until I updated!  I track my workouts on my Apple Watch as well and the workouts are approximately 5 minutes shorter than they used to be.  My two other minor issues are that it no longer gives a verbal cue when the interval is starting and it doesn’t give the 15 second time marker verbally anymore. I appreciate the verbal cues for the plank exercises where I am not staring at the TV.  If these things would go back to how they were I would happily give a 5 star review.  If they don’t get fixed I will be moving on to a new fitness app.","title":"The disappearing workout","userName":"katiekirky"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6665152518","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-11-20T06:40:22Z","developerResponse":{"id":19349269,"body":"We appreciate your feedback and would love if you would contact our CS Team at Help@jillianmichaels.com letting us know what you'd like to see in the app. The premium program which allows you to preview and swap is built on the fly following the select program goal.

When you start many of the eight week to even three month workouts it’s just a lot the same for weeks and weeks with not a lot of change. Even in difficulty.  I find myself going to other trainers Just to get variety and a higher degree of difficulty.  Would be great if there were some workouts with no repeats etc., but it’s a lot of the same stuff in every “new” program. I know it’s hard to keep it fresh, but this is so much repeating. I was disappointed. My honest review is, I love her and love working out to her, but the app needs improvement.  Possibly for people who like to go hard and have variety.  I know you have to cater to a large audience but new stuff with different degrees of difficulty would be great.  Like the cardio that has FOUR circuits of crazy similar exercises, good lord man!  Maybe don’t announce every circuit so it doesn’t feel like Groundhog Day. At least keep us guessing until the end.  But knowing You have four circuits of the same stuff makes you kind of “meh”  about doing it and you start to search for variety.
